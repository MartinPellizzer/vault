Among these, the bone began to garner significant attention. This review covers epidemiological, animal and cell studies on PM2.5 exposure and bone health as well as studies on PM2.5-induced diseases with skeletal complications. Emerging evidence from epidemiological studies indicates a positive association between PM2.5 exposure and the incidence of osteoporosis and fractures, along with a negative association with bone mineral density. Experimental studies have demonstrated that PM2.5 can disrupt the metabolic balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts through inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and endocrine disruption, thereby triggering bone loss and osteoporosis. Additionally, this review proposes a secondary mechanism by which PM2.5 may impair bone homeostasis via pathological alterations in other organs, offering new perspectives on the complex interactions between environmental pollutants and bone health. In conclusion, this contemporary review underscores the often-overlooked risk factors of PM2.5 in terms of its adverse effects on bone and elucidates the mechanisms of both primary and secondary toxicity. Further attention should be given to exploring the molecular mechanisms of PM2.5-induced bone impairment and developing effective intervention strategies. With global climate change, increasing ozone pollution, emerging pollutants, and multifactorial exposure to environmental factors, these issues are likely to become of greater concern in the near future."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
