However, air conditioners rely heavily on electricity and Freon, a chemical that depletes ozone and contributes to greenhouse gas effects. To address this issue, passive daytime radiative coolers (PDRCs) have been proposed to achieve cooling by simultaneously reflecting sunlight and allowing internal heat to escape without electricity. Despite their potential, most high-performance PDRCs are composed of thick polymer films, which increases material costs during PDRC preparation and limits thermal transport. In this work, we introduced an economical and scalable solvent evaporation-based method to prepare a relatively thin hierarchically micro- and nanostructured poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) via crystallinity alteration. Particularly, we find that the key to generating nanosized pores is to remove the water residual within the film without sample annealing, which significantly enhances the scattering efficiency across the solar spectrum. With our design, we demonstrate effective cooling of the outdoor environment, achieving a cooling temperature of \u03942.5 \u00b0C, with a film thickness of only 215 \u03bcm. Furthermore, our model suggested that applying this material could lead to annual energy savings of up to \u223c39% in warmer climates across the country and up to 715 GJ nationwide. Developing effective PDRCs with reduced material thickness, such as the one discussed here, is imperative for implementing sustainable cooling solutions and reducing our carbon footprint."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1978-7352"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Changmin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1202-6606"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Seung-Hyun", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Warren", "ForeName": "Natalie", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuguang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8083-8465"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0000-4102-3661"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Willemsen", "ForeName": "Andes", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez-Pern\u00eda", "ForeName": "Cristina", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Kingon", "ForeName": "Angus I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Hongjie", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4963-9684"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5742-4160"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Meijie", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1179-397X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Sprague-Klein", "ForeName": "Emily A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9593-891X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Sheldon", "ForeName": "Brian W", "Initials": "BW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39250777", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c02567"]}}]}
