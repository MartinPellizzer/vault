Cold plasma reportedly enhances cell proliferation and differentiation and enhances the efficacy of stem cell therapy. However, the exact mechanism of action involved remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of a combination therapy involving the transplantation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) into mice with wounds followed by their activation using no-ozone cold plasma (NCP). Balb/c mMSCs were transplanted into BALB/c mice and treated with NCP for 5\u00a0min. The animals were divided into four groups based on treatments received: no treatment (Wound), mMSCs only (mMSC), NCP only (NCP), and both mMSC and NCP (mMSC\u00a0+\u00a0NCP). NCP treatment was administered six times over two weeks, and tissue samples were prepared by sacrificing the mice in the 1st and 2nd weeks. The wound healing efficacy was assessed using morphological, histological, and molecular approaches including wound healing length measurements, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson trichrome staining, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The wound healing effect was better in the mMSC\u00a0+\u00a0NCP group than that in the groups treated with either. Tracking the injected mMSCs in mice also revealed that the mMSC\u00a0+\u00a0NCP group had a greater survival rate. Furthermore, upon wound healing, the mMSC\u00a0+\u00a0NCP group exhibited elevated levels of growth factors, like platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor. These results suggest that NCP stimulated transplanted mMSCs, resulting in faster wound healing. Therefore, further studies are warranted in preclinical and clinical studies to confirm this effect."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
