To address this issue, we conducted in-situ measurements of emission factors for six dominant tree species in Beijing across four seasons. Subsequently, we developed monthly dynamic standard emission factors (SER-MDs) to model monthly BVOC emissions and their impacts on O<sub>3</sub> formation at citywide and district levels. Our observations revealed pronounced seasonal differences in the BVOC composition and emission rates, as well as their responsiveness to monthly average temperature. By introducing the SER-MDs, we estimated BVOC emissions from the dominant tree species in Beijing to be 38.2\u00a0Gg\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, with monoterpenes and isoprene contributing 49% and 11%, respectively. This calculation reduced the overestimation associated with constant standard emission factors by 31%-38% at district level. The estimates also revealed regional differences in plant compositions rather than simple feedback from regional temperature and photosynthetically active radiation periods. Under these conditions, the maximum monthly BVOC-induced O<sub>3</sub> concentration occurred in August and ranged from 4 to 17\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> across districts, with isoprene being the dominant contributor. Quercus mongolica and Populus tomentosa played significant roles in the formation of BVOC-induced O<sub>3</sub> due to their strong isoprene emitting potential in July-August. These results indicate the necessity of introducing species-specific rhythms of BVOC emissions from dominant species in the development of urban BVOC emission inventories. This approach could inform the development of air pollution management policies that are consistent with the local vegetation composition and O<sub>3</sub> pollution characteristics. For Beijing and other similar northern cities, reducing the use of tree species emitting substantial amounts of isoprene during periods of regional peak ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentrations could constitute an effective nature-based solution for improving urban air quality in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
