We aimed to investigate the associations of comprehensive air pollution and PDIs with OC survival and explored the effects of air pollution-diet interactions.", "The present study encompassed 658 patients diagnosed with OC. The overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthful PDI (hPDI), and the unhealthful PDI (uPDI) were evaluated by a self-reported validated food frequency questionnaire. In addition, an air pollution score (APS) was formulated by summing the concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\u202f% confidence intervals (CIs). The potential interactions of APS with PDIs in relation to overall survival (OS) were assessed on both multiplicative and additive scales.", "Throughout a median follow-up of 37.60 (interquartile: 24.77-50.70) months, 123 deaths were confirmed. Comparing to the lowest tertiles, highest uPDI was associated with lower OS of OC (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.06, 95\u202f%\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a01.30, 3.28; P-trend\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas no significant associations were found between either overall PDI or hPDI and OC survival. Higher APS (HR <sub>for per interquartile range</sub> =\u00a01.27, 95\u202f%\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01, 1.60) was significantly associated with worse OC survival, and the association was exacerbated by adherence to uPDI. Notably, an additive interaction was identified between combined air pollution and uPDI (P < 0.005 for high APS and high uPDI). We also found that adherence to overall PDI aggravated associations of air pollution with OC survival (P-interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.006).", "Joint exposure to various ambient air pollutants was significantly associated with lower survival among patients with OC, particularly for those who predominantly consumed unhealthy plant-based foods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
