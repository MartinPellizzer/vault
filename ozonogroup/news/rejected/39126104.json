In plants, melatonin modulates seed germination, longevity, circadian cycle, photoperiodicity, flowering, leaf senescence, postharvest fruit storage, and resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. In plants, the effect of melatonin is mediated by various regulatory elements of the redox network, including RNS and ROS. Similarly, the radical gas NO mediates various physiological processes, like seed germination, flowering, leaf senescence, and stress responses. The biosynthesis of both melatonin and NO takes place in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Hence, both melatonin and nitric oxide are key signaling molecules governing their biological pathways independently. However, there are instances when these pathways cross each other and the two molecules interact with each other, resulting in the formation of N-nitrosomelatonin or NOMela, which is a nitrosated form of melatonin, discovered recently and with promising roles in plant development. The interaction between NO and melatonin is highly complex, and, although a handful of studies reporting these interactions have been published, the exact molecular mechanisms governing them and the prospects of NOMela as a NO donor have just started to be unraveled. Here, we review NO and melatonin production as well as RNS-melatonin interaction under normal and stressful conditions. Furthermore, for the first time, we provide highly sensitive, ozone-chemiluminescence-based comparative measurements of the nitric oxide content, as well as NO-release kinetics between NOMela and the commonly used NO donors CySNO and GSNO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Mardan 23200, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biosciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7803-429X"], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Adil", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Mardan 23200, Pakistan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5843-2370"], "LastName": "Faheem", "ForeName": "Brekhna", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biosciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Hyung-Seok", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biosciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Da-Sol", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Biological Chemistry, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mun", "ForeName": "Bong-Gyu", "Initials": "BG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biosciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4918-7369"], "LastName": "Rolly", "ForeName": "Nkulu Kabange", "Initials": "NK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biosciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5451-2365"], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Byung-Wook", "Initials": "BW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2021R1A6C101A416,", "Agency": "National Research Foundation of Korea", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101092791", "ISSNLinking": "1422-0067"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "JL5DK93RCL", "NameOfSubstance": "Melatonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Donors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Melatonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Donors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39126104", "10.3390/ijms25158535", "ijms25158535"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
