In this study, we investigated the sensitivities of atmospheric chemical environment with the urban and rural changes to the AER targeting a typical O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode over North China in summer 2019, by conducting two WRF-Chem simulation experiments under two scenarios of anthropogenic emission inventories of years 2012 and 2019 with the meteorological conditions in the 2019 summertime O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode for excluding the meteorological impacts on O<sub>3</sub>pollution. The results show that the unbalanced AER aroused more serious O<sub>3</sub> pollution in urban and rural areas. The intense NO reduction was responsible for the significant increments of urban O<sub>3</sub>, while the falling NO<sub>2</sub> and NO synergistically devoted to the slight O<sub>3</sub> variations in rural areas. Induced by the recent-year AER, the urban O<sub>3</sub> production was governed by VOCs-limited and transition regime, whereas the NOx-limited regime dominated over rural areas in North China. Also, the AER reinforced the atmospheric oxidation capacity with the elevations of atmospheric oxidants O<sub>3</sub> and ROx radicals, strengthening the chemical conversions to secondary inorganic particles. In both urban and rural areas, the sharp drop in SO<sub>2</sub> caused a decrease in sulfate fraction, while the enhanced AOC accelerated the transformation to nitrate even when NOx was reduced. The AER induced nitrate to occupy the principal position in secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> in urban and rural areas. The AER promoted daytime and suppressed nighttime the nitrate production in urban areas, and more vigorous conversion of secondary aerosols were found in rural areas with much lower AOC increments. This study provides insights from a case study over North China in distinct responses of urban and rural O<sub>3</sub> pollution with secondary particle changes to AER in urban and rural atmospheric environment changes, with implications for an effective abatement strategy on O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
