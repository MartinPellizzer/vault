We conducted a statewide population-based cohort study using North Carolina birth data from 2003-2015 (N=1,225,285) to investigate the relationship between air pollution and CHDs (specifically pulmonary valve atresia/stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)). Maternal exposure to particulate matter \u22642.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone during weeks 3-9 of pregnancy were estimated using the Environmental Protection Agency's Downscaler Model. Single- and co-pollutant log-binomial models were created for the entire population and stratified by race to investigate disparities. Positive associations between PM2.5 and CHDs were observed. An increasing concentration-response association was found for PM2.5 and TOF in adjusted, co-pollutant models (Quartile 4 prevalence ratio: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.03). Differences in the effect of PM2.5 on CHD prevalence were seen in some models stratified by race, although clear exposure-prevalence gradients were not evident. Positive associations were also seen in adjusted, co-pollutant models of ozone and AVSD. Study results suggest that prenatal PM2.5 and ozone exposure may increase the prevalence of certain CHDs. A consistent pattern of differences in association by race/ethnicity was not apparent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 2024."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Exercise Science, Morrison Family College of Health, University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, Minnesota, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4401-5381"], "LastName": "Arogbokun Knutson", "ForeName": "Olufunmilayo C", "Initials": "OC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7867-5126"], "LastName": "Luben", "ForeName": "Thomas J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3508-8260"], "LastName": "Stingone", "ForeName": "Jeanette A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9268-4830"], "LastName": "Engel", "ForeName": "Lawrence S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1907-0810"], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "Chantel L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9115-5128"], "LastName": "Olshan", "ForeName": "Andrew F", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7910653", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9262"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39108168", "10.1093/aje/kwae253", "7728129"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
