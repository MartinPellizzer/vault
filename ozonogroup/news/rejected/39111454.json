The need for expanded coverage of air quality measurements across Salt Lake County (SLCO), Utah is being met by mounting air quality and temperature sensors on an expanding fleet of battery electric buses (BEBs). Monitoring air quality from a mobile sensor network provides real-time insights into air pollution patterns at high temporal and spatial resolution. Mobile measurements contribute to assessing residents' exposure to air pollution, facilitating the implementation of cost-effective public health policies and highlighting disparities. The Electric Bus Air Quality Observation Project was launched in SLCO during July 2021 and has collected millions of observations to date. A BEB traveling at typical traffic speeds (~10\u202fm\u202fs<sup>-1</sup>) can provide multiple measurements along city block lengths of up to ~200\u202fm. With careful analysis that factors in the time response of the differing sensors, variability from block-to-block may be attributed to fine-scale factors (e.g., pollution and heat sources, tree shading and urban vegetation, etc.). Preliminary findings showcase the value of increased coverage and resolution. During an extreme heat event in July 2023, both the morning and afternoon temperature readings showed differences of over 6.5\u202f\u00b0C (12\u202f\u00b0F), primarily as an east-west gradient with similar gradients in ozone. We conclude that temperature and pollutant concentration readings, at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, will facilitate future health studies and equitable policy and mitigation strategies. Our study demonstrates that our partnerships established with governmental, non-profit, and transit agencies facilitate the successful transfer of research and development to operational real-time mobile air quality monitoring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
