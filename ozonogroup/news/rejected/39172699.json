There is a growing need to advance the mechanistic understanding of their reactivity as they interact with biological and environmental systems. Herein, for the first time, we report that polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) have intrinsic peroxidase-like activity and are able to mediate oxidative stress. The peroxidase-like activity is dependent on temperature and pH, with a maximum at pH 4.5 and 40 \u00b0C. The catalytic activity exhibits saturation kinetics, as described by the Michaelis-Menten model. The peroxidase-like activity of PSNPs is attributed to their ability to mediate electron transfer from peroxidase substrates to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Ozone-induced PSNP aging can introduce oxygen-containing groups and disrupt aromatic structures on the nanoplastic surface. While ozonation initially enhances peroxidase-like activity by increasing oxygen-containing groups without degrading many aromatic structures, extended ozonation destroys aromatic structures, significantly reducing this activity. The peroxidase-like activity of PSNPs can mediate oxidative stress, which is generally positively correlated with their aromatic structures, as suggested by the ascorbic acid assay. These results help explain the reported oxidative stress exerted by nanoplastics and provide novel insights into their environmental and public health implications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Jiangsu 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Jiangsu 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Siyue", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2118-9124"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Greenpeace Research Laboratories, Bioscience, University of Exeter, Exeter EX4 4RN, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mengjiao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0014-1829"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Jiangsu 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Heyun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6725-7199"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "Pedro J J", "Initials": "PJJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9157-4274"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Jiangsu 210023, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing University (Suzhou) High-tech Institute, Suzhou 215123, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiaolei", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39172699", "10.1021/acs.est.4c04487"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
