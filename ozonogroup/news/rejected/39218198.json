Here, we use the ground-based and satellite measurements during the period 2005-2020 to deduce the trends of TPO, which is significantly positive in the tropical and extra-tropical northern hemisphere (0.2-0.5 DU/yr) and southern extra-tropics (0.1-0.2 DU/yr). Furthermore, the trends derived using a multiple linear regression model (MLR) also confirm these estimates, which are about 0.05-0.1 /DU/yr and the regions with higher trends (> 0.06 /DU/yr) are statistically significant. We also use a standalone Rapid Radiative Transfer Model coupled with a convective model (Radiative-Convective Model; RCM) to assess the climate forcing of ozone using its vertical profiles from the Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis (MERRA)-2 reanalysis. The estimated temperature rise due to the radiative forcing of ozone in the tropical troposphere (1000-100 hPa) is about 0.2-0.3 \u00b0C for the study period. In brief, there is a positive trend in the tropospheric ozone in the tropics and extra-tropics, which is a great concern for regional warming, public health and ecosystem dynamics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
