landfill lechate + ammonium and micropollutants
. ammonium can be biologically removed
. but bio-relcitrant micropollutants require post-treat like ozonation

. expanded clay ggregates packed biorilm column (EBC)
. demonstrate feasibility of coupling biodegradation and ozonation (CBAO)
    . to remove nitrogen and bio-recalcitrant micropollutants

. first 60 days: only biodegradation process
    . 51% nidtrogen was biologically removed 
    . but micropollutant cabamazepine (CBZ) was only 30%
. from day 61 to 150: used both biodegradation and ozonation in EBC
    . after 48 hours: ozone wan ntroduced and bubbling trhrough EBC for 30 min to further remove residual micropollut.
    . at 0.4 gO3/gCOD were removed
    . avg nitrogen removal efficiency (85%) was ++ by 34%, because ++ of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in EBC

. CBAO process good for treating landfill lechate

antimicrobal efficacy of novel ophthalmic solution
    . ozonated sunflower oil in liposones 
    . + hypromellose in conjuntion
    . with liposomal foam (BlofOX)
    . in patitents undergoing intravitreal injection 
    . compared to povicone iodine 5%

. 195 patients
    . total of 390 eyes
    . divided into 2 groups
    . conjuntival swaps wer colleted at baseline (T0-3 days before injection)

. home terapy assigned
    . included instilling 2 drops of isotonic ophthalmic solutino with 0.5% ozonated sunflower oil in liposomes plus hypromellos (Ozodrop)
    . 4 times daily
    . applying liposomal foam 2 times daily 

. the control group
    . povidone iodine 5%

. treatment for 3 days
    . at T1 (10 min before injection), all patients get 1 drop of topical solution of povidone iodine 5%
        . in conjunctival sac of both eyes
    . after 30 sec, the conjunctival swab was obtained 

. res
    . show significant reduction of microbial load (both in chocolate and blood ager (p < 0.007))
    . povidone iodine 5% + Ozodrop + BlefOX gave greater reduction than providone iodine 5% alone
    . killed about 41% to 49% of bacterial
