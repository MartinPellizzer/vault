Samples were exposed at different ozone concentrations (from 2.2 micrograms to 108 micrograms/ml) for 30 sec and then incubated for different times at 37 degrees C in a 95% air-5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Supernatants were collected and frozen at-20 degrees C until tested for interferon (IFN) activity. We have determined that the ozone concentration is critical for lymphokine induction. In fact, while low concentrations (2.2 micrograms/ml) are effective in lymphocytes, they do not induce IFN in either whole or diluted (1:1) human blood, or resuspended buffy coats. In such cases levels as high as 42 micrograms/ml are required. On the other hand, a very high ozone concentration (108 micrograms/ml) is not effective and probably toxic. Maximal IFN production occurs 72-96 h after ozone exposure, and the kinetics of IFN release is similar to that after Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B addition. Because ozonization of blood is a medical procedure followed in several countries for treatment of viral diseases, this study can open a new field of investigation that may yield useful results both in biological and practical terms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istituto di Fisiologia Generale, Universit\u00e0 di Siena, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bocci", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paulesu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Haematologica", "NlmUniqueID": "0417435", "ISSNLinking": "0390-6078"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon Inducers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon Inducers"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stimulation, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2129118"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
