Ramets of these two hybrid clones received similar total photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) within the LF and LL treatments. Visible foliar symptoms, leaf gas exchange, and growth were measured. More severe O(3) induced foliar symptoms were observed on ramets within the LF and LL treatments than within the HL treatment for both clones. The LF treatment resulted in significantly greater foliar injury than the LL treatment for NE388. The LF and LL treatments generally resulted in lower photosynthetic rates (Pn) for both clones, but did not affect stomatal conductance (g(wv)); therefore, the ratios of g(wv)/Pn and the O(3) uptake/Pn were greatest in plants grown under the LF treatment, followed by those grown under LL treatment; plants grown under HL had the lowest ratios of g(wv)/Pn and O(3) uptake/Pn. Greater ratios of g(wv)/Pn and O(3) uptake/Pn were consistently associated with more severe visible foliar symptoms. The negative impacts of the LF treatment on growth were greater than those of the LL treatment. Results indicate that not only the integral, but also the pattern of photo flux density, may affect carbon gain in plants. Increased foliar injury may be expected under light fleck conditions due to the limited repair capacity as a result of continuity of O(3) uptake while photosynthesis decreases under LL conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, ThePennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pennypacker", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferdinand", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savage", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stevenson", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15158035", "10.1016/j.envpol.2003.12.009", "S0269749103004846"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
