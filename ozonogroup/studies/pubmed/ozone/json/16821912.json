The isotopic composition of the product CO(2) was analyzed by mass spectrometry. A kinetic model was used to calculate the expected CO(2) composition based on available reaction rates and their modifications for isotopic variants of the participating molecules. A comparison of the two (experimental data and model predictions) shows that the product CO(2) is endowed with an anomalous enrichment of heavy oxygen isotopes. The enrichment is similar to that observed earlier in case of O(3) produced by O+O(2) reaction and varies from 70 0/00 to 136 0/00 for (18)O and 41 0/00 to 83 0/00 for (17)O. Cross plot of delta (17)O and delta (18)O of CO(2) shows a linear relation with slope of approximately 0.90 for different experimental configurations. The enrichment observed in CO(2) does not depend on the isotopic composition of the O atom or the sources from which it is produced. A plot of Delta(delta (17)O) versus Delta(delta (18)O) (two enrichments) shows linear correlation with the best fit line having a slope of approximately 0.8. As in case of ozone, this anomalous enrichment can be explained by invoking the concept of differential randomization/stabilization time scale for two types of intermediate transition complex which forms symmetric ((16)O(12)C(16)O) molecule in one case and asymmetric ((16)O(12)C(18)O and (16)O(12)C(17)O) molecules in the other. The delta (13)C value of CO(2) is also found to be different from that of the initial CO due to the mass dependent fractionation processes that occur in the O+CO-->CO(2) reaction. Negative values of Delta(delta (13)C) ( approximately 12.1 0/00) occur due to the preference of (12)C in CO(2)* formation and stabilization. By contrast, at lower pressures (approximately 100 torr) surface induced deactivation makes Delta(delta (13)C) zero or slightly positive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Research Laboratory, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad 380 009, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Antra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16821912", "10.1063/1.2206584"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
