Ozone (O3) is one of the most reactive components of photochemical air pollution. Despite extensive investigations by many laboratories on the functional, biochemical, and cellular effects of O3 exposure in humans, animals, and in vitro systems, questions remain concerning the potential adverse effects to human health represented by chronic near-ambient exposure to this environmental pollutant. In the present investigation, the influence of inhalation of O3 and nitric acid (HNO3) vapor on polyamine levels was examined in rat lungs. Male F344/N rats were exposed nose-only to 0.15 ppm O3 and 50 microg/m3 HNO3 vapor alone and in combination for 4 hours/day. 3 days/week for a total of 40 weeks. At this time the animals were sacrificed and their lungs were examined for polyamine contents. Exposure to O3 and O3 plus HNO3 vapor caused a significant increase in the putrescine content of the lung compared to the air-exposed controls (P < 0.05). The concentrations of pulmonary spermidine and spermine were not significantly increased by exposure to either O3 or HNO3 vapor alone or in combination compared to the air-exposed controls. The role of polyamines in repair and anti-inflammatory processes has been discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of California at Irvine, 92697-4800, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sindhu", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mautz", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kikkawa", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-34688", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-50450", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arch Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0417615", "ISSNLinking": "0340-5761"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2FZ7Y3VOQX", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "411VRN1TV4", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U87FK77H25", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V10TVZ52E4", "NameOfSubstance": "Putrescine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Putrescine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Spermidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Spermine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9708884", "10.1007/s002040050525"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
