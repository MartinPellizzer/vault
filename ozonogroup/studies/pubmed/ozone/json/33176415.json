The objective of this study was to explore the efficacy of medical device that produced ozonized water (Medica S.r.l. Bologna, Italy) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis of adult patients. A randomized controlled split-mouth study was carried out in ten patients (5 men and 5 women age 42-73 mean 55 \u00b1 7) with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. None of these patients received any surgical or non-surgical periodontal therapy and demonstrated radiographic evidence of moderate bone loss. The mouth has been divided into upper right and left quadrants. The upper and lower right quadrants were treated with ultrasonic scaler, the left quadrants with ultrasonic scaler with ozonated water. Ten microbiological samples were collected from upper left quadrants and 10 from upper right quadrants from each patient. Microbiological samples were collected from the sites of the patients at baseline and at the 7th day. Twenty localized chronic periodontitis sites were selected (10 in left quadrants and 10 in right quadrants). After the treatment with ozonized water, a remarkable decrease in bacteria amount, both for some species and for the total count was observed in the left quadrants respect to right ones. Our study demonstrated the efficacy of the ozonized water in the management of moderate to severe chronic periodontitis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, Centre of Neuroscience of Milan, University of Milano Bicocca, 20126 Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Moreo", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LAB SRL, Codigoro, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mucchi", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44100 Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Carinci", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Scaling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Pocket"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33176415", "4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
