Compared to Fe<sub>10</sub>Ce<sub>1</sub> oxide, the Fe<sub>10</sub>Ce<sub>1</sub> oxide/PC not only greatly improved the degradation efficiency of PNP, but also reduced the dosage of catalyst. Through the BET test, the Fe<sub>10</sub>Ce<sub>1</sub> oxide/PC has a high specific surface area to absorb part of the pollutants. VSM test shows that the material is magnetic and easy to recycle. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the experimental condition, and the optimal removal rate was 90% when the initial pH was 9, the catalyst dosage was 0.4 g/L, and the ozone addition was 1.77 L/min (5.9 mg/L). Finally, the mechanism of PNP degradation was explored utilizing inhibitor and ESR free radical detection. The adsorption capacity of the material and electron-absorbing property of PNP jointly determined the high catalytic efficiency with Fe<sub>10</sub>Ce<sub>1</sub> oxide/PC in catalytic ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200093, China E-mail: huangyuanxing@usst.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Xiaojie", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200093, China E-mail: huangyuanxing@usst.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yuanxing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200093, China E-mail: huangyuanxing@usst.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Zhihao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200093, China E-mail: huangyuanxing@usst.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200093, China E-mail: huangyuanxing@usst.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhiguo", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30K4522N6T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "619G5K328Y", "NameOfSubstance": "ceric oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y92ZL45L4R", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cerium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33989194", "10.2166/wst.2021.131"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
