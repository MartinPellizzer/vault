Covalent adduct chemical ionization and ozone-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (MS) methods enable unambiguous assignment of PMI-FA double bond positions, however, no method has been reported with electrospray ionization (ESI) platform using off-the-shelf systems. In the current work, we studied the Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi (PB) fragmentation patterns of PMI-FA and triacylglycerol (TG) by analyzing several known food sources. PB-MS/MS and MS<sup>3</sup> enabled complete double bond location assignments, including the isolated double bond in PMI-FA and triacylglycerols. Sea urchin (\"uni\"), oyster, pine nut, and ginkgo nut were characterized for their signature PMI-FA, 20:2(5<i>Z</i>,11<i>Z</i>), 22:2(7<i>Z</i>, 15<i>Z</i>), 18:3(5<i>Z</i>,9<i>Z</i>,12<i>Z</i>), and 20:3(5<i>Z</i>,11<i>Z</i>,14<i>Z</i>), respectively. Quantitative analyses of the relative abundance of these PMI-FA led to results similar to reference methods. 18:3(5<i>Z</i>,9<i>Z</i>,12<i>Z</i>) was enriched at the <i>sn</i>-1/<i>sn</i>-3 position in pine nut major TG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5715-2193"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 66, Gongchang Road, Guangming District, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518107, P.
