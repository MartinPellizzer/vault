Absolute bimolecular reaction rate constants for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals (*OH) with DOM (k*(OH), DOM) were determined. k*(OH, DOM) values are expressed as moles of carbon. Based on direct measurement of transient DOM radicals (DOM*) and competition kinetic techniques, both using pulse radiolysis, the k*(OH, DOM) value for a standard fulvic acid from the Suwannee River purchased from the International Humic Substances Society was (1.60 +/- 0.24) x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). Both pulse radiolysis methods yielded comparable k*(OH, DOM) values. The k*(OH, DOM) values for the seven DOM isolates from different sources ranged from 1.39 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) to 4.53 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1), and averaged 2.23 x 108 M(-1) s(-1) (equivalent to 1.9 x 10(4) (mgC/L)(-1) s(-1)). These values represent the first direct measurements of k*(OH, DOM,) and they compare well with literature values obtained via competition kinetic techniques during ozone or ultraviolet irradiation experiments. More polar, lower-molecular-weight DOM isolates from wastewater have higher k*(OH, DOM) values. In addition, the formation (microsecond time scale) and decay (millisecond time scale) of DOM* transients were observed for the first time. DOM* from hydrophobic acids exhibited broader absorbance spectra than transphilic acids, while wastewater DOM isolates had narrower DOM* spectra more skewed toward shorter wavelengths than did DOM* spectra for hydrophobic acids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Arizona State University, Box 5306, Tempe, Arizona 85287-5306, USA. p.westerhoff@asu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Westerhoff", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mezyk", "ForeName": "Stephen P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cooper", "ForeName": "William J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Minakata", "ForeName": "Daisuke", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XII14C5FXV", "NameOfSubstance": "fulvic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pulse Radiolysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17695909", "10.1021/es062529n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
