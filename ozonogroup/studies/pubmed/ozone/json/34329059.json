Herein, using Yangquan as a case study, emission factor (EF) method and \"(tracer ratio) TR - positive matrix factorization (PMF)\" combined method based on atmospheric data were used to establish and verify the VOC emission inventory in coal resource-based cities, respectively. The total VOC emissions in Yangquan were 9283.2\u00a0t [-40.0%, 62.1%] in 2018, with industrial processes being the major contributors. Alkanes (35.8%), aromatics (25.0%), and alkenes (19.8%) were the main compounds in the emission inventory. The verification results for both species emission and source structure were in agreement, indicating the accuracy of VOC emission inventory based on EF method to a certain extent. However, for some species (ethane, propane, benzene, and acetylene), the EF method indicated emissions lower than those obtained from the TR results. Furthermore, the summer-time emission contribution from fossil fuel combustion indicated by the EF method (23.4%) was lower than that obtained from the PMF results (38.4%). Overall, these discrepancies could be attributed to the absence of a coal gangue source in the EF method. The verification results determined the accuracy of the VOC emission inventory and identified existing problems in the estimation of the VOC emission inventory in coal resource-based cities. In particular, not accounting for the coal gangue emissions may result in an underestimation of VOC emissions in coal resource-based cities. Thus, coal gangue emissions should be considered in future research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
