Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a highly reactive gas with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects on bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. It can easily be produced locally in small generators, and dissolved in tap water, and quickly transmits into ordinary O<sub>2</sub> in the surrounding air.", "To compare ozonized tap water and alcohol rub in decontamination of bacterially contaminated hands.", "A cross-over study among 30 nursing students. Hands were artificially contaminated with Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), then sanitized with ozonized tap water (0.8 or 4 ppm) or 3 mL standard alcohol-based rub (Antibac 85%). The transient microbes from fingers were cultivated and colony-forming units (cfu)/mL were counted. The test procedure was modified from European Standard EN 1500:2013.", "All contaminated hands before disinfection showed cfu >30,000/mL. The mean (SD) bacterial counts in (cfu/mL) on both hands combined were 1017 (1391) after using ozonized water, and 2337 (4664) after alcohol hand disinfection. The median (range) values were 500 (0-6700) and 250 (0-16,000) respectively (non-significant difference). Twenty per cent of participants reported adverse skin effects (burning/dryness) from alcohol disinfection compared with no adverse sensations with ozone.", "Ozonized tap water is an effective decontaminant of E.\u00a0coli, and it could be an alternative to traditional alcohol-fluid hand disinfectants both in healthcare institutions and public places.
