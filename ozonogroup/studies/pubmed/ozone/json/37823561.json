Here, we conducted real-time measurements of aerosol composition in five summers from 2018 to 2022 along with WRF-Community Multiscale Air Quality simulations to characterize the changes in aerosol chemistry and the roles of meteorology and emission reductions. Largely different from winter, secondary inorganic aerosol and photochemical-related secondary organic aerosol (SOA) showed significant decreases by 55-67% in summer, and the most decreases occurred in 2021. Comparatively, the decreases in the primary aerosol species and gaseous precursors were comparably small. While decreased atmospheric oxidation capacity as indicated by ozone changes played an important role in changing SOA composition, the large decrease in aerosol liquid water and small increase in particle acidity were critical for nitrate changes by decreasing gas-particle partitioning substantially (\u223c28%). Analysis of meteorological influences demonstrated clear and similar transitions in aerosol composition and formation mechanisms at a relative humidity of 50-60% in five summers. Model simulations revealed that emission controls played the decisive role in reducing sulfate, primary OA, and anthropogenic SOA during the Three-Year Action Plan, while meteorology affected more nitrate and biogenic SOA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric
