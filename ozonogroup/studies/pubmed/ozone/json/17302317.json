The ozone was applied directly to raw wastewater, as well as to wastewater already treated with APT, and the results compared against a control sample of potable water. The experimental conditions that reported the best results was wastewater treated with O3 (at a dose of 4.8 mg/L, at pH 7, temperature 23 degrees C, for 1 hr), given that it met standards in force in Mexico with regard to micro-organism and heavy metal content. Under these conditions, after 15 min of ozonation, 100% destruction of the following bacteria was observed: V. cholerae, S. typhi as well as total and faecal coliforms. Destruction of helminth eggs and Giardia sp. took one hour. No phytotoxic elements or heavy metals were found. The balance of nutrients N:P:K (300:100:200 mg/kg) required for lettuce growth, was found in wastewater subjected to both treatment plans. However, ozone favoured the nitrification and assimilation of the nutrients, by contributing oxygen to the soil. Therefore, these conditions produced the greatest lettuce growth, the entire plant averaging 38 cm in length and 125 g. in weight. Moreover, a better appearance of the leaves was also noted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Ingenieria, UNAM, Edif. 5, Coyoac\u00e1n, 04510 Mexico, D.
