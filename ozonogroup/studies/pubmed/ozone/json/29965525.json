However, fouling of RO membranes has been a severe problem and key limiting factor in the widespread application of the RO process. The operating characteristics and fouling characteristics of a RO membrane system for desalination of dyeing wastewater were investigated in an industrial park in Guangdong Province. The results showed that the COD and turbidity of RO influent after ozone oxidation-sand filtration-ultrafiltration (UF) processes were 12.4 mg \u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> and<1 NTU, respectively, with a stable desalination rate of the RO system of around 98%. The COD and turbidity of the RO effluent were 0.7 mg \u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.12 NTU, respectively. However, after 3 years of operation, the pressure drop across the membrane reached 0.6 MPa, and the permeate flux decreased to 120 m<sup>3</sup> \u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>, which could not be restored to its original flux by chemical cleaning. The organic and inorganic matter occupied (53.5\u00b10.2)% and (46.5\u00b10.2)% of the deposits on the RO membrane, respectively, suggesting both organic and inorganic fouling were the main problems for the RO membrane. Si, Al, and Ca were major inorganic elements on the RO membrane. Large amounts of Si, Al, and organic matter deposited on the RO membrane were dissolved easily by alkaline (NaOH) solution than acid (HCl) solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control(SMARC), School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Yu-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control(SMARC), School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ze-Tian", "Initials": "ZT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qian-Yuan", "Initials": "QY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Jialida Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd., Foshan 528000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control(SMARC), School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Environmental Science and New Energy Technology Engineering Laboratory, Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Hong-Ying", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Jialida Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd., Foshan 528000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Pei-Wen", "Initials": "PW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965525", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201707020"]}}]}
