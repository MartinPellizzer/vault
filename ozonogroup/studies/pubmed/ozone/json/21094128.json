Previously, we have shown that, in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, ChSeco induces oxidative stress followed by apoptosis involving both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways. In the present study, we investigated the nature of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its associated redox signaling in H9c2 cells upon treatment with ChSeco. Both catalase and deferoxamine, which lowered intracellular ROS, were found to alleviate the ChSeco-induced cytotoxicity. ChSeco-treated H9c2 cells showed a significant decrease in the intracellular catalase activity, suggesting the involvement of H(2)O(2) in the associated cytotoxicity. Additionally, in ChSeco-exposed cells, there was a marked increase in lipid peroxidation and pre-treatment with SB 203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) and MEK1/2 inhibitor (ERK1/2 and JNK inhibitor) rendered protection against the cytotoxicity. An early increase in the expression of p-SAPK/JNK or delayed p38 MAPK did not alter ATF-2 but decreased c-Jun expression in these cells. Overall, these findings are consistent with MAPK signaling resulting from increased cellular H(2)O(2) in ChSeco-induced cytotoxicity in cardiomyoblasts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.
