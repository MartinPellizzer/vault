Reductions from 0 to 20% of potential crop yields were estimated due to ambient O3. Rural O3 exposures measured in the Tennessee Valley were significantly higher than the measured urban exposures, suggesting that spatial interpolation from urban O3 records may underestimate rural O3 and thereby potential crop loss. Seasonal mean O3 exposures were highest in summer 1983, and similar in 1982 and 1984. Although a consistent inverse relationship was found between measured crop yields in the Tennessee Valley and seasonal O3 exposures, annual variation in yields was much greater than attributable to the annual variation in O3. Moisture stress, as indicated by the Palmer Drought Severity Indices, is likely the major determinant for yields of nonirrigated crops. This is consistent with field studies that demonstrate that ambient O3 levels can reduce crop yields under ideal soil moisture conditions, but cause little to no detectable yield reduction for nonirrigated crops. These models could be improved if crop response to O3 were allowed to vary as a function of environmental factors such as moisture stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tennessee Valley Authority, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37401, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brewer", "ForeName": "P F", "Initials": "PF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parkhurst", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meeks", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092556", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90040-1", "0269749188900401"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
