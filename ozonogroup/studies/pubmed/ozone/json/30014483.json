SO<sub>2</sub> , one of the major airborne pollutants, has long been reported to induce stomatal closure, yet the mechanism remains unknown. Little is known about the stomatal response to airborne pollutants besides O<sub>3</sub> . SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAC1) and OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) were identified as genes mediating O<sub>3</sub> -induced closure. SLAC1 and OST1 are also known to mediate stomatal closure in response to CO<sub>2</sub> , together with RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGs (RBOHs). The overlaying roles of these genes in response to O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> suggested that plants share their molecular regulators for airborne stimuli. Here, we investigated and compared stomatal closure event induced by a wide concentration range of SO<sub>2</sub> in Arabidopsis through molecular genetic approaches. O<sub>3</sub> - and CO<sub>2</sub> -insensitive stomata mutants did not show significant differences from the wild type in stomatal sensitivity, guard cell viability, and chlorophyll content revealing that SO<sub>2</sub> -induced closure is not regulated by the same molecular mechanisms as for O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> . Nonapoptotic cell death is shown as the reason for SO<sub>2</sub> -induced closure, which proposed the closure as a physicochemical process resulted from SO<sub>2</sub> distress, instead of a biological protection mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9056-283X"], "LastName": "Ooi", "ForeName": "Lia", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsuura", "ForeName": "Takakazu", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Agricultural and Life Science, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Munemasa", "ForeName": "Shintaro", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Agricultural and Life Science, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7864-1903"], "LastName": "Murata", "ForeName": "Yoshiyuki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Katsuhara", "ForeName": "Maki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirayama", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2235-0779"], "LastName": "Mori", "ForeName": "Izumi C", "Initials": "IC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "SLAC1 protein, Arabidopsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "OST1 protein, Arabidopsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OJ9787WBLU", "NameOfSubstance": "hydrogen sulfite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfites"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30014483", "10.1111/pce.13406"]}}]}
