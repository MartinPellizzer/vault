The clinical data and the corresponding weather data of the day in Hangzhou were collected and analyzed. Also, the monthly etiological classification of convulsions and the monthly average air data of Hangzhou were statistically analyzed.", "The highest incidence of convulsion was observed in children 1 to 2 years old, and higher in boys than in girls. The top three main causes were febrile seizure, benign infantile convulsion with mild gastroenteritis, and epilepsy. Among the meteorological factors, the increase in the level of 2.5 micron particulate matter (PM <sub>2.5</sub>) in the air per month led to an increase in the number of patients with febrile seizure, benign infantile convulsion with mild gastroenteritis, and epilepsy, where the increase of ozone in 8 hours (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) per month led to a decrease in the number of patients with such conditions.", "PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> are the main meteorological factors affecting the occurrence of convulsions in children in Hangzhou, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> are risk factors.
