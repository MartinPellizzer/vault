This study examines the effectiveness of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in catalytic ozonation for degrading CYN. The chemical kinetics of the reactions of ozone (O3) and hydroxyl radicals (OH(\u2022)) with CYN were determined. The results reveal that TiO2 significantly increases the rate of degradation of CYN by increasing the rate of production of hydroxyl radicals (OH(\u2022)) by initiating the decomposition of O3 on the surface of the catalyst. At a pH of 7 with 1.0 mg L(-1) O3 and 500 mg L(-1) TiO2; the pseudo-first-order ozone decomposition rate constant (k(D)) increased from 3.04 \u00d7 10(-3) to 16.53 \u00d7 10(-3) s(-1) and the ratio of OH(\u2022) to O3 concentrations (R(ct)) increased from 1.87 \u00d7 10(-8) to 126.4 \u00d7 10(-8). The calculated second-order rate constant (k(overall)) of the reaction of CYN with O3 and OH(\u2022) was 3.22 M(-1)s(-1) without TiO2. However, the greatest improvement in k(overall) in this study was observed using 500 mg TiO2 L(-1), which increased koverall by a factor of five. TiO2-catalyzed ozonation is an efficient method of oxidation that reduces the toxic activity of CYN. The results of a Microtox test concerning the toxic activity of CYN during oxidation reveal that catalytic ozonation may either increase or reduce the toxicity of CYN toward test samples. The toxic effects of CYN on the samples are greatly influenced by the TiO2 dosage and reaction time, possibly yielding by-products that may change the mutagenic properties of CYN. Three water samples from a eutrophic lake in Taiwan were examined to evaluate the effect of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity on the oxidation of CYN. DOC had the greatest effect on the oxidation of CYN in the ozonation of eutrophic water. Overall, the degree of CYN oxidation depended on the rate constant of the reaction with ozone and the consumption of ozone by the natural water matrix."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Engineering and Science, Feng Chia University , Taichung City , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chih-Chao", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Winn-Jung", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Bo-Hao", "Initials": "BH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56HH86ZVCT", "NameOfSubstance": "Uracil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Uracil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26191986", "10.1080/10934529.2015.1047664"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
