Base on the observational data, surface-level O<sub>3</sub>, vertical distribution characteristics boundary layer O<sub>3</sub> as well as its effect on surface-level O<sub>3</sub> are thoroughly analyzed. The O<sub>3</sub> lidar results showed similar vertical O<sub>3</sub> profiles both in pollution episodes and clean periods, from which a high O<sub>3</sub> concentration layer between 300 and 500 m and a sub-high O<sub>3</sub> concentration layer between 1300 and 1700 m (near the top of the mixing layer) can be found. Besides, the downward O<sub>3</sub> transport paths from the high/sub-high O<sub>3</sub> concentration layers could be observed along with the boundary layer evolution: At nighttime, large amounts of O<sub>3</sub> were effectively stored into the residual layer (RL). Due to the upward development of Mixing layer (ML) in early morning, atmospheric vertical mixing carried the O<sub>3</sub> inside the RL down to the surface, which led to a rapid increase in the surface-level O<sub>3</sub>. The sub-high O<sub>3</sub> layer began the downward mixing at noon, and became well-mixed after the boundary layer was fully developed in the afternoon, by which the near surface O<sub>3</sub> pollution deteriorated again. Further analysis of the heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes show that, the high O<sub>3</sub> concentration inside the RL contributed 54% \u00b1 6% of the surface-level O<sub>3</sub> at 9:00 LT and the average contribution of O<sub>3</sub> in the sub-high concentration layer to the surface-level O<sub>3</sub> at 14:00 LT was 26% \u00b1 9%. Based on the quantitative analysis of the observational data, this paper focus to reveal the importance of the contribution of O<sub>3</sub> inside the RL and near the top of the ML to the surface O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
