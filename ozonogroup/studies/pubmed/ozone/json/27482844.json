Over the range of pressures included in this study, no pressure dependence in k(T) was observed. k(296 K) obtained using the two techniques agreed to within \u223c3% with (3.26 \u00b1 0.26) \u00d7 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (2\u03c3 absolute uncertainty) obtained using the PLP-LIF technique. k(T) displayed non-Arrhenius behavior that is reproduced by (7.34 \u00b1 0.30) \u00d7 10(-19)T(2)\u202fexp[(481 \u00b1 10)/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). With respect to OH reactive loss, the atmospheric lifetime of HFO-1438ezy(E) is estimated to be \u223c36 days and HFO-1438ezy(E) is considered a very short-lived substance (VSLS) (the actual lifetime will depend on the time and location of the HFO-1438ezy(E) emission). On the basis of the HFO-1438ezy(E) infrared absorption spectrum measured in this work and its estimated lifetime, a radiative efficiency of 0.306 W m(-2) ppb(-1) (well-mixed gas) was calculated and its 100-year time-horizon global warming potential, GWP100, was estimated to be 8.6. CF3CFO, HC(O)F, and CF2O were identified using infrared spectroscopy as stable end products in the oxidation of HFO-1438ezy(E) in the presence of O2. Two additional fluorinated products were observed and theoretical calculations of the infrared spectra of likely degradation products are presented. The photochemical ozone creation potential of HFO-1438ezy(E) was estimated to be \u223c2.15."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Research Laboratory, Chemical Sciences Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80305, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Photochemistry and Chemical Kinetics, Department of Chemistry, University of Crete , Vassilika Vouton, 71003 Heraklion, Crete, Greece."}], "LastName": "Papadimitriou", "ForeName": "Vassileios C", "Initials": "VC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Research Laboratory, Chemical Sciences Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80305, United States."}], "LastName": "Burkholder", "ForeName": "James B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27482844", "10.1021/acs.jpca.6b06096"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
