The emissions of black carbon (BC) with the other air pollutants (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, HFC, PFC, and SF<sub>6</sub>), is taking considerable attention in the world because of its ability to effect air quality and weather. The Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) region has been considered as one of the greatest source of emissions in India. The short lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) like BC, methane, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons have been considered as a climate forcing agent along with CO<sub>2</sub>. These pollutants have shorter lifetime in atmosphere compared to CO<sub>2</sub> and account for the 40-45% of global warming. Among them, BC has a great global warming ability and can increase the Earth's temperature much quicker than carbon dioxide. After CO<sub>2</sub>, the second highest donors to global warming are CH<sub>4</sub> and BC. Recognising the importance of these pollutants, daily concentrations of BC, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were monitored in three district of IGP during January 2015 to December 2016. The GAINS model was used for assessment of pollution effects, emissions of SLCPs, GHGs and identifying appropriate control actions. The outcomes of modelling advocate that low carbon strategies are more competent to reduce emissions as compared to other control strategies. But, application of low carbon strategies would be restricted by the accessibility of clean fuels. In some cases, finance will be needed to support monitoring of air pollution and other supportive technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
