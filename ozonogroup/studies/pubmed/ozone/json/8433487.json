Ozone 1.5% was obtained from an ozonizer which separates the ozone from oxygen. Objects were 30 mature rabbits and they inhaled 3% oxygen in 97% nitrogen (PaO2 17-19 mmHg) by spontaneous respiration through a tracheostomy cannula. Objects were divided into three groups. Control rabbits inhaled only anoxic gases without ozone administration. Although the oxygen group also inhaled anoxic gases, pure oxygen was administered through an A-V shunt, previously made on femoral artery and vein, with an oxygenator, named Nichidai style (counter-current-exchange method). Similarly, the ozone group was given ozone with the oxygenator via A-V shunt. In each group, survival time as well as ATP, ADP, AMP and lactic acid lipo-peroxide in brain were examined. After the administration of ozone, survival time was prolonged significantly, compared with the control group (P < 0.005). Equally, ATP and energy charge in the brain were well maintained (P < 0.005) and the lactate production was inhibited significantly (P < 0.005). These results indicate that oxidizing effect of ozone will be beneficial to maintain energy charge in brain tissue during hypoxia. Further, ozone might activate the energy metabolism in animal tissues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shiratori", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaneko", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sano", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishizu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Masui", "NlmUniqueID": "0413707", "ISSNLinking": "0021-4892"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia, Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8433487"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
