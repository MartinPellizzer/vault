Ozone is a powerful oxidizer, but low concentrations of ozone can protect various organs from oxidative stress. Some studies have demonstrated a link between ozone and myocardioprotection, but the mechanism remains unclear. To establish an in vivo animal model of ischemiareperfusion injury (I/R), this study utilized C57 mice, while an in vitro model of hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury was developed using H9c2 cardiomyocytes to simulate ischemiareperfusion injury. Ozone pretreatment was used in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Through this research, we found that ozone therapy can reduce myocardial injury, and further studies found that ozone regulates the expression levels of these ferroptosis-related proteins and transcription factors in the H/R model, which were screened by bioinformatics. In particular, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was enhanced by pretreatment with ozone, inhibited ferroptosis and ameliorated oxidative stress by initiating the expression of Slc7a11 and Gpx4. Significantly, Nrf2 gene silencing reverses the protective effects of ozone in the H/R model. In summary, our results suggest that ozone protects the myocardium from I/R damage through the Nrf2/Slc7a11/Gpx4 signaling pathway, highlighting the potential of ozone as a new coronary artery disease therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
