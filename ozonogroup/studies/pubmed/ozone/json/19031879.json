Temperature dependent rate coefficients for the reaction of AcAc with the OH radical were determined over the temperature range 285-310 K using the relative kinetic method. The following Arrhenius expression was derived: k = 3.35 x 10(-12) exp((983 +/- 130)/T) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1), where the indicated error is the two least-squares deviation. A rate coefficient (in units of cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1)) of (1.03 +/- 0.31) x 10(-18) has been obtained at (298 +/- 3) K for the reaction of ozone with AcAc. A product investigation on the gas-phase reaction of OH radical with AcAc was conducted in a 405 L borosilicate glass chamber using in situ FTIR spectroscopy to monitor reactants and products. Methylglyoxal, acetic acid, peroxy acetic nitrate (PAN) were positively identified as products with molar yields of (20.8 +/- 4.5)%, (16.9 +/- 3.4)%, and (2.0 +/- 0.5)%, respectively. From the residual infrared spectrum the main products are attributed to 2,3,4-pentantrione (CH3-CO-CO-CO-CH3) and its hydrated analogue pentan-2,3-dione-4-diol (CH3-CO-CO-C(OH)2-CH3). Based on the observed products, a simplified mechanism for the reaction of the OH radical with AcAc is proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory for Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Science, Peking University, 100871 Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shouming", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bejan", "ForeName": "Iustinian", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Albu", "ForeName": "Mihaela", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benter", "ForeName": "Thorsten", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "46R950BP4J", "NameOfSubstance": "acetylacetone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pentanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19031879", "10.1021/es8010282"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
