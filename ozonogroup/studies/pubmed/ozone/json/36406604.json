We in this research, synthesized BiOI@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL125(Ti)/Zeolite nanocomposite as a novel nanocomposite to degradation of benzene in hybrid advanced oxidation process. The nanocomposite synthesized via solvothermal method. The effect of airflow, ozone gas concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration, relative humidity and initial benzene concentration are the main parameters in the UV/O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/ nanocomposite hybrid process that were studied. The characterization by XRD, FT-IR, FESEM, EDS element mapping, TEM, BET, and UV-vis spectra indicated that nanocomposite were well synthesized. Optimal operating conditions of the process were determined at air flow of 0.1\u00a0l/min, ozone concentration of 0.3\u00a0mg/min, hydrogen peroxide concentration of 150\u00a0ppm, relative humidity of 45\u2009\u00b1\u20093% and benzene concentration of 50 ppmv. Under these conditions, more than 99% of benzene was degraded. The synergistic effect coefficient of the mechanisms is 1.53. The nanocomposite had good stability in the hybrid process and remained above 99% efficiency up to 5 times. The ozone concentration residual the system was reported to be negligible (0.013\u00a0mg/min). The CO and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the hybrid process was higher than other processes, which indicates better mineralization in the hybrid process. Formaldehyde, octane, noonan, phenol, decanoic acid were reported as the main by-products. The results indicated that UV/O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/ nanocomposite hybrid process has fantastic efficiency in the degradation of benzene as one of the indicators of VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical Sciences 2022, Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehralipour", "ForeName": "Jamal", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Health Technology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Ahmad Jonidi", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Health Technology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholami", "ForeName": "Mitra", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Health Technology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esrafili", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.411746.1", "0000 0004 4911 7066"], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Health Technology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kermani", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Health Sci Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101613643"}, "CoiStatement": "Competing interestsThe authors of this article declare that they have no conflict of interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Dai Z, Li D, Ao Z, Wang S, An T.
