Children had nevi counted on the back, face and arms at ages 6, 10, and 12 years. Erythemally effective UV irradiance was used to estimate ambient exposure from their places of residence before entry to the study at age 6 years. Data on UV radiation were derived from satellite measurements of ozone and atmospheric reflectivity.", "At baseline, the response rate was 70%. At age 10, 90% of those recruited had nevus counts and at age 12, 69%. Children who had migrated to Perth from geographical locations with higher erythemal irradiance had, on average, 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.54) times as many nevi on the back at age 6, 1.29 (1.13-1.49) as many at age 10 and 1.10 (0.92-1.30) times as many at age 12. No significant associations were seen for the face or arms.", "Ambient solar UV exposure in early childhood is positively associated with number of nevi and nevi develop soon after exposure to sunlight."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Epidemiology Centre, The Cancer Council Victoria, 1 Rathdowne St., 3053, Carlton, VIC, Australia. dallas.english@cancervic.org.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "English", "ForeName": "Dallas R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milne", "ForeName": "Elizabeth", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simpson", "ForeName": "Julie A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Causes Control", "NlmUniqueID": "9100846", "ISSNLinking": "0957-5243"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nevus, Pigmented"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Victoria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16411059", "10.1007/s10552-005-0425-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
