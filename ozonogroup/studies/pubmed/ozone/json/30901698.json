Characterization analyses, including SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, and photoluminescence test showed that the C-MgO was successfully synthesized. L8 orthogonal arrays according to the Taguchi methodology optimized the synthesis of the C-MgO as follows: sucrose to MgO ratio\u202f=\u202f0.5, sonication time\u202f=\u202f15\u202fmin, calcination temperature\u202f=\u202f400\u202f\u00b0C and pH\u202f=\u202f10.5. A central composite design based on response surface methodology was employed to optimize and model the COP in the removal of HA. A quadratic polynomial model with p-value < 0.0001 and R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.9988 showed a better fit to experimental responses. The optimum levels of the studied parameters in the COP based on the predictive model were obtained as follows: pH\u202f=\u202f9.5, reaction time\u202f=\u202f12\u202fmin, catalyst dose\u202f=\u202f1\u202fg/L, and HA concentration\u202f=\u202f5\u202fmg/L. The HA mineralization was determined to be 86.8% at the 100\u202fmin reaction time. Additionally, the COP exhibited 34% synergistic effect and the kinetic rate constant of 0.1898 min<sup>-1</sup> in the HA removal. The presence of tert-butanol, methanol, salicylic acid, and some anions did not significantly affect the removal of the HA in the COP. From a practical view, this report indicated that the C-MgO catalyst could be potentially applied in the COP for the treatment of the water having high concentrations of HA substances."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
