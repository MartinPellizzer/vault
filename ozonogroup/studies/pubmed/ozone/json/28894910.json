The results showed that DT or/and EO significantly decreased net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), but increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde content (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with EO alone, the combination of EO and DT caused higher values in Pn, Fv/Fm, SOD activity (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and smaller stomata size and lower visible injury rate. DT alleviated the adverse impact of EO on the shrub by increasing enzyme activity and decreasing stomatal size, particularly stomatal width. The study provided increasing evidence that moderate drought might exert a beneficial effect on the tested plants to adapt to the future climate change, particularly in high ozone regions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China. hexy1962@126.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xingyuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yanqing", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lonicera"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28894910", "10.1007/s00128-017-2179-2", "10.1007/s00128-017-2179-2"]}}]}
