Its decomposition is investigated by ozonolysis at room temperature and the major products like phenol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, dihydroxy-benzoic acid as well as the total yield of aldehydes and carboxylic acids were determined as a function of applied ozone concentration. In addition, the DPO-degradation was studied by a combined action of gamma-ray under continuous bubbling of a known ozone concentration. In this case the formation of the same products is observed, but their yields differ from the above ones. Based on the synergistic action of ozone and gamma-ray the DPO-radiolysis is rather efficient, leading to an initial-G-value of 11.3. Some probable reaction mechanisms are presented for explanation of the degradation process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Radiation Chemistry and Radiation Biology, c/o The University of Vienna, Althanstr. 14, A-1090 Wien, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Popov", "ForeName": "Petar", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Getoff", "ForeName": "Nikola", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phenyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15018069", "10.1515/znc-2004-1-228"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
