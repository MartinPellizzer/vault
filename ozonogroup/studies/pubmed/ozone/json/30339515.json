While the removal of 1,4-dioxane was small (20%) and mineralization negligible after 6\u2005h of ozonation treatment, the removals of 1,4-dioxane and total organic carbon increased by factors of 10.35 and 81.25, respectively, after catalytic ozonation in the presence of CuO. The mineralization during catalytic ozonation was favoured at pH 10 (94.91\u2005min<sup>-1</sup>), although it proceeded even at pH 3 (54.41\u2005min<sup>-1</sup>). The CuO catalyst decreased the equilibrium concentration of soluble ozone and favoured its decomposition to reactive oxidative species. Radical scavenging experiments demonstrated that superoxide radicals were the main species responsible for the degradation of 1,4-dioxane. Further scavenging experiments with phosphate confirmed the presence of Lewis active sites on the surface of CuO, which were responsible for the adsorption and decomposition of ozone. The reaction mechanism proceeded through the formation of ethylene glycol diformate, which quickly hydrolyzed to ethylene glycol and formic acid as intermediate products. The stability of CuO indicated weak copper leaching and high catalytic activity for five recycling cycles. The toxicity of the water, assessed by <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> bioluminescence assays, remained the same (low toxicity) after catalytic ozonation while it increased after treatment with ozonation alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1992-2916"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Scaratti", "ForeName": "Gidiane", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9539-9741"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Basso", "ForeName": "Alex", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physics Gleb Wataghin, University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Landers", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "Pedro J J", "Initials": "PJJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Nanocatalysis & Photoreaction Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK."}], "LastName": "Puma", "ForeName": "Gianluca Li", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2863-7260"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "Regina F P M", "Initials": "RFPM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J8A3S10O7S", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-dioxane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V1XJQ704R4", "NameOfSubstance": "cupric oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dioxanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30339515", "10.1080/09593330.2018.1538259"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
