In this paper, a new 20-species, 76-step detailed kinetic mechanism was proposed between O3 and NOx. The concentration of N2O5 was measured using an in-situ IR spectrometer. The numerical evaluation results kept good pace with both the public experiment results and our experiment results. Key reaction parameters for the generation of NO2 and N2O5 during the NO ozonation process were investigated by a numerical simulation method. The effect of temperature on producing NO2 was found to be negligible. To produce NO2, the optimal residence time was 1.25sec and the molar ratio of O3/NO about 1. For the generation of N2O5, the residence time should be about 8sec while the temperature of the exhaust gas should be strictly controlled and the molar ratio of O3/NO about 1.75. This study provided detailed investigations on the reaction parameters of ozonation of NOx by a numerical simulation method, and the results obtained should be helpful for the design and optimization of ozone oxidation combined with the wet flue gas desulfurization methods (WFGD) method for the removal of NOx."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015.
