The object of this article is to identify primary ozone disinfection by-products (DBPs) and to ascertain the effects of bromide (Br-) concentration, pH, natural organic material (NOM) characteristics, ozone dosage, and other water quality parameters on their formation in ozonated waters derive from seven groundwaters. The results of this study show that bromate formation is favored at high pH, high initial bromide concentrations, and high ozone dosage, but low dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and ammonia levels. On the other hand, organic by-products were favored at low pH, high bromide levels, and high O3/DOC ratios. In general, bromoform (CHBr3) and aldehydes concentration first increased, then diminished, as the dosage of ozone was increased. Ammonia appears to reduce both bromate and bromoform. Additional brominated organic by-products produced via ozonation of a variety of groundwaters in this study were monobromoacetic acid (MBAA), dibromoacetic acid (DBAA), 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP), dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN). The levels of these by-products are affected by the water quality characteristics. The background organic nitrogen (organic-N) content of the different water sources may be correlated with amounts of DBAN formed. It was also found that the characteristic of organic precursors have significant influences on brominated organic by-products formation. Humic acid demonstrated the highest CHBr3, DBAA, and 2,4-DBP formation, whereas hydrophilic neutral produced less CHBr3 and 2,4-DBP than the rest of the organic fractions but produced the highest amount of DBAN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Hung Kuang Institute of Technology, Sha-Lu, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC. huangwj@sunrise.hkc.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Winn-Jung", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yei", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Chenghwa", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14672325", "10.1081/ese-120025841"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
