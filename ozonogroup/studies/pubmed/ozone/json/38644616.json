While a multidisciplinary approach might provide additional advantages, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory role of intra-articular oxygen-ozone (O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) injections combined with physical therapy is still unknown.

We assessed patients with TMC-OA who had not responded to standard medical therapy. Participants received O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> therapy and targeted physical therapy for 4\u2009weeks. Pain relief, muscle strength, and physical functioning were assessed at baseline and after 4, 12 and 24\u2009weeks (respectively T0, T1, T2, and T3).", "Seventeen patients with a mean age of 67.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u2009years were included in the study.
