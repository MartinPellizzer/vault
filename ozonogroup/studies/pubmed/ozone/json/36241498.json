However, several challenges limit its efficient use in crop production, including the emergence of PH<sub>3</sub>-resistant insect pests and the incidence of phytotoxic effects on nursery plants. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the mechanism underlying PH<sub>3</sub> phytotoxicity in plants using transcriptomic techniques. Fumigation with 2\u00a0g/m<sup>3</sup> PH<sub>3</sub> induced phytotoxic effects in A. thaliana, as evidenced by a decrease in growth and vegetation indices compared to the control group. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PH<sub>3</sub> fumigation phytotoxicity responses in A. thaliana involve genes related to hypoxia stress and energy metabolism. Additionally, pretreatment with ethylene induced pre-adaptation to hypoxia under light conditions during fumigation effectively suppressed the phytotoxic effects of PH<sub>3</sub> in A. thaliana by increasing the expression of hypoxia-adaptive genes. Moreover, the phytotoxicity of PH<sub>3</sub> was also confirmed in pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata Duch.), and was dependent on light. Overall, our findings showed that fumigation under light conditions and ethylene pretreatment could be used to minimize PH<sub>3</sub>-induced phytotoxic effects in plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
