The absolute rate constants and activation energies agreed within experimental error with the well-established values for the SO + O(3) reaction in all detector configurations. When ozone was present in the reaction zone, the reaction of the furnace effluent with NO(2) also was in good agreement with the rate constant for the SO + NO(2) reaction. However, when ozone was not present in the reaction zone, little or no reaction occurred with NO(2). These results imply that an unknown sulfur species, X, is formed in the combustion zone and/or transfer line of the instrument and converted to SO upon reaction with ozone in the chemiluminescence detection cell. Based on our experimental results and known reaction rate constants, we can eliminate S(2), S(2)O, SO(2), S(2)O(2), HS, HSO, HSO(2), HOSO(2), and H(2)S as X. We hypothesize that X is S(3) formed in the association reaction of S atoms with S(2) within the transfer line."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0215."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burrow", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Birks", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21639338", "10.1021/ac960937b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
