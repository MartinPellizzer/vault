Ozone mass transport within the indoor surface boundary layer plays a key role in ozone-surface reaction kinetics. However, limited information is available on detailed ozone transport dynamics near realistic, irregular indoor surfaces. This paper presents a research framework to study the underlying mechanisms of ozone reactions with realistic indoor surfaces based on microscope scanning of surface material and detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The study results show that indoor surface topography can meaningfully affect ozone mass transport within a surface boundary layer, thereby modulating near-surface ozone concentration gradient and surface uptake. The results also reveal that the effective indoor surface area available for ozone reaction varies with indoor air speed and turbulent air mixing within the boundary layer. The detailed dynamic behaviors of ozone reactions with realistic indoor surfaces provide insights into the implications of pollutant-surface interactions on indoor chemistry and air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Architectural Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States."}], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Gen", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States."}], "LastName": "Xuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6876-7185"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, United States."}], "LastName": "Morrison", "ForeName": "Glenn", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0751-3605"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Architectural Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States."}], "LastName": "Rim", "ForeName": "Donghyun", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35670501", "10.1021/acs.est.1c08040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
