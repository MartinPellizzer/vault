RL was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC), and lung volumes above and below FRC, after exposure to MCh aerosols generated from solutions of 0.1-300 mg MCh/ml. The relative site of response was examined by magnifying parenchymal [RL with large tidal volume (VT) at fast frequency (RLLS)] or airway effects [RL with small VT at fast frequency (RLSF)]. Measurements were performed on dogs before and after 2 h of exposure to 3 ppm O3. MCh concentration-response curves for both RLLS and RLSF were sigmoid shaped. Alterations in mean lung volume did not alter RLLS; however, RLSF was larger below FRC than at higher lung volumes. Although O3 exposure resulted in small leftward shifts of the concentration-response curve for RLLS, the airway dominated index of RL (RLSF) was not altered by O3 exposure, nor was the maximal response using either index of RL. These data suggest O3 exposure does not affect MCh responses in conducting airways; rather, it affects responses of peripheral contractile elements to MCh, without changing their maximal response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Physiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kariya", "ForeName": "S T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shore", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skornik", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ingram", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drazen", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-07118", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-19170", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-35006", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Residual Capacity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Volume Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3063712", "10.1152/jappl.1988.65.6.2679"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
