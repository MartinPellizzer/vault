Products were extracted from the reaction mixture with AcOEt and their structures were analyzed. 1-Nitrobenzimidazole derivatives and unexpected 1-nitrobenzotriazole derivatives were identified. Although the yields of 1-nitrobenzimidazole derivatives were quite low, these were all new compounds that could be obtained only by Kyodai nitration. It was speculated that benzotriazoles were formed via 1-nitrobenzimidazoles and subsequent nitration toward benzotriazoles resulted in the formation of 1-nitrobenzotriazoles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaiya", "ForeName": "Toyo", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Masaru", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyata", "ForeName": "Naoki", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohda", "ForeName": "Kohfuku", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzimidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "86110UXM5Y", "NameOfSubstance": "benzotriazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E24GX49LD8", "NameOfSubstance": "benzimidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzimidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triazoles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15133210", "10.1248/cpb.52.570"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
