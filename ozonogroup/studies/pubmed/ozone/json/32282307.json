Unfortunately, this has also caused deterioration of human health and threats to the global environment, even deaths when highly exposed to certain chemicals, whether due to improper use, mishandling or disposal. There are chemicals, which apart from being carcinogens, endocrine disruptors or neurotoxins, are also responsible for climate change and ozone depletion. Certain chemicals are known to cause neurotoxicity and are having tendencies to damage the central and peripheral nervous system or brain by damaging neurons or cells which are responsible for transmitting and processing of signals. This has raised serious concerns for the use and handling of such chemicals and has given growth to a relatively new emerging field known as Green Chemistry that strives to achieve sustainability at the molecular level and has an ability to harness chemicals to meet environmental and economic goals. It has been reported in the literature that apart from family history in the aetiology of Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also termed as \"Lou Gehrig's disease\", a neurological disorder, environmental factors, heavy metals, particularly selenium, lead, mercury, cadmium, formaldehyde, pesticides and certain herbicides are known to cause ALS. ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease affects the motor cortex, brain stem and spinal cord, causing muscular weakness, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. In this article we are aiming to discuss and summarize the various corroborations and findings supporting the undesirable role of chemical substance/herbicides/pesticides in ALS aetiology and its mitigation by adopting green chemistry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Delhi Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research, Sector-III, MB Road, Pushp Vihar, New Delhi 110017, India."}], "LastName": "Fayaz", "ForeName": "Faizana", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, P.O.
