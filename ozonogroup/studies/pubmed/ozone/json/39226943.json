Ammonium can be biologically removed but bio-recalcitrant micropollutants removal requires post-treatment like ozonation. This study developed an expanded clay aggregates packed biofilm column (EBC) and demonstrated its feasibility of coupling biodegradation and ozonation (CBAO) to simultaneously remove nitrogen and bio-recalcitrant micropollutants. The first 60\u202fdays only had biodegradation process to start the bioreactor. 51\u202f% nitrogen was biologically removed but the removal of micropollutant carbamazepine (CBZ) was only 30\u202f%. From 61 d to 150 d, both biodegradation and ozonation were performed in the EBC. After 48\u202fh-biodegradation, ozone gas was introduced and bubbling through EBC for 30\u202fmin to further remove residual micropollutants. At 0.4 gO<sub>3</sub>/gCOD, CBZ were completely removed. The average nitrogen removal efficiency (85\u202f%) was increased by 34\u202f% because the increased abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in EBC. This study confirmed the promising potential of the CBAO process for treating landfill leachte."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
