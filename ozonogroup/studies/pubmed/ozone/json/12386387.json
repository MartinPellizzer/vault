The endothelial product is chemically equivalent to nitric oxide (NO) [23, 40] or a biochemical congener thereof [48]. Fifteen years ago, this small, simple and highly toxic molecule was known as a lengthy list of environmental pollutants found in unsavory haunts such as smoke and smog, and even as destroyer of ozone, suspected carcinogen, and precursor of acid rain. In addition, NO seems an unlikely biological jack of all trades for most of the body's functions are regulated by extraordinarily large and complex proteins and compounds. But over the past decade, diverse lines of evidence have converged to show that this sometime poison is a fundamental player in the everyday business of the human body."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ch.Ch.", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yen", "ForeName": "M.-H.", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomed Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9421567", "ISSNLinking": "1021-7770"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12386387", "10.1007/BF02253425", "JBS04249"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
