The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of ozonated olive oil gel in the management of peri-implant mucositis. A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted among 50 patients with peri-implant mucositis within the age group of 25-50 years. They were randomly divided into two groups with 25 participants in each group based on the intervention [Group A (Ozonated olive oil gel), Group B (Chlorhexidine gel)]. Silness and Loe plaque index (PI) and Loe and Silness gingival index (GI) were recorded at baseline and after 4 weeks. Paired t-test and independent t-test was used to test the significance. Within the groups, there was a statistically significant reduction in PI and GI from baseline (P < 0.05). However, the difference in PI and GI between both the groups was statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). Ozonated olive oil gel was equally effective to chlorhexidine gel in the management of peri-implant mucositis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "Apurva", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Rajasekar", "ForeName": "Arvina", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Randomized Controlled Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Long Term Eff Med Implants", "NlmUniqueID": "9110830", "ISSNLinking": "1050-6934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Olive Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Implants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Olive Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mucositis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peri-Implantitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gingivitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Implants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38305372", "10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.2023047323", "6a31c4ce3e5f7188,1d5240c547aeb908"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
