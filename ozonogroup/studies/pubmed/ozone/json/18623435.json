The immobilization reaction was mediated by a watersoluble carbodiimide, which allowed formation of a co-valent linkage between the ligand proteins and the grafted poly(acrylic acid)chains. The yields of the immobilized ligand proteins were of the order of 1 mg/g fiber. Their binding affinity and capacity to respective specific proteins were studied in vitro from a buffered solution and serum. It was found that the specific proteins were selectively adsorbed with dissociation constants as low as 1x 10(-6) M, suggesting the adsorption to take place through highly specific protein-protein interaction. An addition of serum albumin did not significantly affect the specific binding, regardless of the ligand proteins. The binding capacity ranged from 1 x 10(-13) to 1x 10(-11) mol/cm(2) primarily depending on the surface density of the immobilized ligands and the number of their binding sites per molecule.
