Biochar synthesized by pyrolysis of sludge obtained from coking wastewater treatment was evaluated for the catalytic ozonation of phenol in aqueous solution. The present work focused on testing the catalytic performance of biochar, deducing the kinetics of phenol removal in various reaction conditions, and finally elucidating the mechanism of biochar-enhanced phenol removal. The results demonstrated that biochars produced at pyrolysis temperatures of 700 and 900\u202f\u00b0C revealed highly comparable catalytic activity in phenol ozonation, leading to around 95% phenol removal within 30\u202fmin reaction, due to the abundant carbonyl groups on biochar surface. The biochar, however, was suffered from poor stability, which was attributed to biochar loss and changes in surface chemistry. On the basis of examining reaction variables, an empirical kinetic model was developed well matching experimental results. It was found that ozone concentration adsorbed on biochar surface was first increased with a peak (3.8\u202fmg/L for biochar obtained at 700\u202f\u00b0C) at reaction time 10\u202fmin, after which it decreased along with proceeding reaction. In light of radical scavenging test, superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub>-) was identified as main radical species produced from the interaction of ozone with biochar surface, while hydroxyl radical (OH) played negligible role in biochar catalytic ozonation. The promoting mechanism of bicarbonate on phenol ozonation was verified to be the generation of O<sub>2</sub>- via series reactions of HCO<sub>3</sub>- with OH and ozone, apart from increase in solution pH. These results provide important implications for future recycling of coking wastewater treatment sludge in environmental remediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
