Lambs were exposed to air (controls) or to 1 ppm O3 for 4 h/day for 5 days during the 1st wk of life. Tracheal mucus velocity (TMV), a marker of lung mucociliary clearance, was measured in vivo at birth (0 wk) and up to 24 wk later, and tracheal secretory function was measured (in vitro) and the morphology of the tracheal mucosa was determined at 0 and 2 wk in both groups. In the control group, TMV increased 94% from 0 to 2 wk (P less than 0.05), continued to increase until reaching a plateau at 8 wk, and then remained constant from 8 to 24 wk. In contrast, O3-exposed lambs showed a 24% decrease in TMV from 0 to 2 wk (P less than 0.05 vs. control), and throughout the remaining time TMV remained below (P less than 0.05) that observed in control lambs. O3 exposure partially prevented the age-dependent decrease in basal secretion of tracheal macromolecules normally observed between 0 and 2 wk. These changes in secretory function were associated with a significant increase in tissue conductance (37%, P less than 0.05 vs. 0 wk), predominantly the result of active chloride secretion. The functional changes induced by O3 were associated with a retardation of the normal morphological development of the tracheal epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Disease, University of Miami, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida 33140."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mariassy", "ForeName": "A T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abraham", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phipps", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sielczak", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wanner", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ESO-3041", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-31722", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2ZD004190S", "NameOfSubstance": "Threonine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mucociliary Clearance"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Threonine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2117007", "10.1152/jappl.1990.68.6.2504"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
