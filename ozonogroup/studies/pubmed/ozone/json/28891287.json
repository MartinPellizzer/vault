Due to the nonlinearity in the response of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> to their precursors, contributions from multiregional sources are challenging to quantify. Here we developed an updated extended response surface modeling technique (ERSMv2.0) to address this challenge. Multiregional contributions were estimated as the sum of three components: (1) the impacts of local chemistry on the formation of the pollutant associated with the change in its precursor levels at the receptor region; (2) regional transport of the pollutant from the source region to the receptor region; and (3) interregional effects among multiple regions, representing the impacts on the contribution from one source region by other source regions. Three components were quantified individually in the case study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei using the ERSMv2.0 model. For PM<sub>2.5</sub> in most cases, the contribution from local chemistry (i.e., component 1) is greater than the contribution from regional transport (i.e., component 2). However, regional transport is more important for O<sub>3</sub>. For both O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the contribution from regional sources increases during high-pollution episodes, suggesting the importance of joint controls on regional sources for reducing the heavy air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3716-8646"], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3381-4767"], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuxiao", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering and Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California , Los Angeles, California 90095, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wenjing", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Dian", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Carey", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center , Guangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Xing", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry , Hahn-Meitner-Weg 1, 55128 Mainz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiandong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fenfen", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Jiming", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28891287", "10.1021/acs.est.7b01975"]}}]}
