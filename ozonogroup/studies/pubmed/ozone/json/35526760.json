Although the demand for sunscreens is increasing to protect the human skin from these adverse effects, commercially available sunscreens have some limitations in safety. In this study, silk fibroin (SF) composite with biocompatibility and blood coagulation activity was prepared for a highly safe sunscreen. However, the SF has a disadvantage in that it is difficult to dissolve in water. To improve the solubility of SF, butyl glycidyl ether (BGE) was reacted with the side chain of SF to prepare a freely water-soluble SF (mSF) derivative, and the phase behavior according to the mixing ratio of SF derivative and tannic acid (TA) was observed. In addition, ZnO nanoparticles were added to the mSF-TA solution to form a hydrogel through the coordination bonding. The UV blocking, hemostatic, antibacterial and antioxidant effects of the mSF/TA/ZnO composite hydrogel were evaluated, and the excellent skin compatibility of multifunctional hydrogel sunscreen was confirmed through a skin irritation test."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
