The role of stress, which may integrate effects of social and environmental exposures on health, is unknown. We examined whether an individual's perspective on their own well-being, as assessed using self-rated measures of stress and health, modifies the pollutant-mortality relationship.", "The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-mortality cohort includes respondents from surveys administered between 2001 and 2012 linked to vital statistics and postal codes from 1981 until 2016. Annual fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure estimates were attached to a sample of cohort members aged 30-89 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0398,300 respondents/3,848,400 person-years). We examined whether self-rated stress, distress, mental health, and general health modified associations between long-term exposure to each pollutant (three-year moving average with one-year lag) and non-accidental mortality using Cox survival models, adjusted for individual- (i.e. socioeconomic and behavioural) and neighbourhood-scale covariates.", "In fully-adjusted models, the relationship between exposure to pollutants and mortality was stronger among those with poor self-rated mental health, including a significant difference for NO<sub>2</sub> (hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.25 per IQR) compared to those with very good/excellent mental health (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08; Cochran's Q\u00a0=\u00a04.01; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Poor self-rated health was similarly associated with higher pollutant-associated HRs, but only in unadjusted models. Stress and distress did not modify pollutant-mortality associations.", "Poor self-rated mental and general health were associated with increased mortality attributed to exposure to ambient pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2020.
