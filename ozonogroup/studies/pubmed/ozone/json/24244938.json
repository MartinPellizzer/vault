Here, we demonstrate that product ions arising from the collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the [M + Na](+) adduct ions of phospholipids can be isolated and subjected to subsequent gas-phase ozonolysis - known as ozone-induced dissociation (OzID) - in a linear ion-trap mass spectrometer. The resulting CID/OzID experiment yields abundant product ions that are characteristic of the acyl substitution on the glycerol backbone (i.e., sn-position). This approach is shown to differentiate sn-positional isomers, such as the regioisomeric phosphatidylcholine pair of PC 16:0/18:1 and PC 18:1/16:0. Importantly, CID/OzID provides a sensitive diagnostic for the existence of an isomeric mixture in a given sample. This is of very high value for the analysis of tissue extracts since CID/OzID analyses can reveal changes in the relative abundance of isomeric constituents even within different tissues from the same animal. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to assign carbon-carbon double bond positions to individual acyl chains at specific backbone positions by adding subsequent CID and/or OzID steps to the workflow and that this can be achieved in a single step using a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. This unique approach represents the most complete and specific structural analysis of lipids by mass spectrometry demonstrated to date and is a significant step towards comprehensive top-down lipidomics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Free Radical Chemistry and Biotechnology, School of Chemistry, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia. blanksby@uow.edu.au toddm@uow.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Pham", "ForeName": "Huong T", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maccarone", "ForeName": "Alan T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "J Larry", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "Todd W", "Initials": "TW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Blanksby", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Analyst", "NlmUniqueID": "0372652", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2654"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycerophospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycerophospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24244938", "10.1039/c3an01712e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
