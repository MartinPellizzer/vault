To better understand their characteristics and life cycles, surface data from the Seoul Weather Station (SWS) and surface and 850-hPa wind field data covering northeast Asia around the Korean Peninsula were used for the analysis. In the July 1992 episode, westerly winds were most frequent as a result of the influence of a high-pressure system west of the Korean Peninsula behind a trough. In contrast, in the July 1994 episode, easterly winds were most frequent as a result of the effect of a typhoon moving north from the south of Japan. Despite different prevailing wind directions, the peak O3 concentrations for each episode occurred when a sea/land breeze developed in association with weak synoptic forcing. The August 1994 episode, which was selected as being representative of calm conditions, was another typical example in which a well-developed"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Global Environment Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul. ysghim@kist.re.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghim", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11256497", "10.1080/10473289.2001.10464269"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
