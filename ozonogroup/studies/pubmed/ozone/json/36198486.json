For each subject, individualised residential exposures to ambient particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u22641 \u00b5m (PM<sub>1</sub>), \u22642.5 \u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), \u226410 \u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone were extracted from our validated grid dataset.", "An IQR increase of lag 04-day exposure to PM<sub>1</sub> (IQR: 11.6 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (IQR 21.9 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), PM<sub>10</sub> (IQR 35.0 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), SO<sub>2</sub> (IQR 4.4 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), NO<sub>2</sub> (IQR 23.3 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and CO (IQR 0.25 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) was significantly associated with a 9.77% (95% CI 2.21% to 17.89%), 8.74% (95% CI 1.05% to 17.00%), 13.93% (95% CI 5.36% to 23.20%), 10.81% (95% CI 1.82% to 20.60%), 14.97% (95% CI 8.05% to 22.34%) and 7.37% (95% CI 0.98% to 14.16%) increase in odds of HF readmissions, respectively. With adjustment for other pollutants, the association for NO<sub>2</sub> exposure remained stable, while the associations for PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and CO exposures became insignificant. Overall, an estimated 19.86% of HF readmissions were attributable to NO<sub>2</sub> exposure, while reducing NO<sub>2</sub> exposure to the WHO and China air quality standards would avoid 12.87% and 0.54% of readmissions, respectively.
