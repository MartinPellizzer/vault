We have used ab initio theory to predict the forward and reverse rate constants for the competing hydrogen abstraction and homolytic substitution (SH2) channels of the title reactions. Including the spin-orbit stabilization of the transition structures increases the rate constants by factors between 1.3 and 49. For the atmospherically relevant case of CH3I, our findings suggest that the hydrogen abstraction and homolytic substitution reactions are competitive. The predicted branching fraction to CH3Br is about 13%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical and Chemical Properties Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899-8380, USA. karl.irikura@nist.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Irikura", "ForeName": "Karl K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17580833", "10.1021/jp071314c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
