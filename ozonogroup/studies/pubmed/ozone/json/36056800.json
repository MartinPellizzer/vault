The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of topical ozone in the treatment of mammalian wounds. A structured search of five scientific databases returned a total of 390 unique studies. Of these, 22 studies were included in this review. Four studies provided enough data to be included in a meta-analysis evaluating the time to complete wound healing. All studies were randomised controlled trials of humans or other mammalian animals that reported clinical signs of wound healing. Each study was critically analysed by a six-point assessment of the risk of bias. Wounds treated with topical ozone had a greater reduction in wound size than similar wounds treated with controls or standard of care in all studies. Those treated with ozonated liquids also had a shorter time to wound healing by approximately one week. In conclusion, topical ozone contributed to enhanced wound healing in all studies. While additional human experiments would be helpful to quantify ozone's specific effects on wound healing compared to standard treatment, topical ozone should be considered as part of an overall wound management strategy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Authors.
