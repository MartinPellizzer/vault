To study the molecular mechanism involved in the ultraviolet A effect, human HaCaT keratinocytes were exposed to ultraviolet A at doses of 10 J per cm2 and 30 J per cm2. Ultraviolet A irradiation caused dose- and time-dependent apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry, and the activation of caspase-3. To study the genes altered by ultraviolet A at an apoptosis-inducing dose (30 J per cm2), cells were harvested immediately after ultraviolet A treatment (0 h), and 6 h and 24 h after ultraviolet A exposure. Total RNA was extracted for microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis, and cellular proteins were extracted for western blot analysis. Of the selected critical genes/proteins, the induction of c-Jun, c-myc, and p33ING1, and the repression of epidermal growth factor receptor, inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and survivin pathways, could be involved in ultraviolet-A-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, the late induction of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 was indicative of possible cell cycle recovery in surviving cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed these results and a majority of the protein levels paralleled their corresponding RNA levels. In addition, ultraviolet A treatment altered the expression of genes involved in signal transduction, RNA processing, structural proteins, and metabolism in a time-dependent manner. This initial microarray analysis could advance our understanding of cellular responses to ultraviolet A exposure, and provide a platform from which to further study ultraviolet-A-induced apoptosis and carcinogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacology and Chemistry, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. he3@niehs.nih.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yu-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jian-Li", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sik", "ForeName": "Robert H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waalkes", "ForeName": "Michael P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chignell", "ForeName": "Colin F", "Initials": "CF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0426720", "ISSNLinking": "0022-202X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Repair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15009741", "10.1046/j.0022-202X.2003.22123.x", "S0022-202X(15)30651-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
