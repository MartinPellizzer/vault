However, indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agriculture watershed water surfaces are poorly understood. Here, surface-dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O concentration in water bodies of the agricultural watershed in Eastern China, one of the most intensive agricultural regions, was measured over a two-year period. Results showed that the dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations varied in samples taken from different water types, and the annual mean N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations for rivers, ponds, reservoir, and ditches were 30\u202f\u00b1\u202f18, 19\u202f\u00b1\u202f7, 16\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 and 58\u202f\u00b1\u202f69\u202fnmol\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations can be best predicted by the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N concentrations in rivers and by the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N concentrations in ponds. Heavy precipitation induced hot moments of riverine N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were observed during farming season. Upstream waters are hot spots, in which the N<sub>2</sub>O production rates were two times greater than in non-hotspot locations. The modeled watershed indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emission rates were comparable to direct emission from fertilized soil. A rough estimate suggests that indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions yield approximately 4% of the total N<sub>2</sub>O emissions yield from N-fertilizer at the watershed scale. Separate emission factors (EF) established for rivers, ponds, and reservoir were 0.0013, 0.0020, and 0.0012, respectively, indicating that the IPCC (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) default value of 0.0025 may overestimate the indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emission from surface water in eastern China. EF was inversely correlated with N loading, highlighting the potential constraints in the IPCC methodology for water with a high anthropogenic N input."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
