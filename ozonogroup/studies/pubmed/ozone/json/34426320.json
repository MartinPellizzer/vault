The mixing ratios of O<sub>3</sub>, total VOCs (TVOCs) and NO<sub>x</sub> were 40.0 \u00b1 5.3, 22.5 \u00b1 2.6 and 14.6 \u00b1 3.8 ppbv, respectively (\u00b195% confidence intervals). O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors existed a well negative correlation, indicating intensive local O<sub>3</sub> formation. To further explore the O<sub>3</sub>-precursors relationship and observation-oriented O<sub>3</sub> control strategies, a photochemical box model coupled with master chemical mechanism (PBM-MCM) was adapted. The relative incremental reactivity (RIR) calculated by model results showed that Leshan was in the VOCs-limited and O<sub>3</sub> production was most sensitive to alkenes. Moreover, O<sub>3</sub> isopleth diagram was drawn using the PBM-MCM simulation results and seven reduction scenarios were evaluated in Leshan. The reduction ratio of VOCs/NO<sub>x</sub> on 3:1 was proposed to be the best solution, which can be achieved effective reduction on local O<sub>3</sub> formation. At last, since VOCs were the key precursors of O<sub>3</sub> in Leshan, VOC sources and their potential contributions to O<sub>3</sub> formation were investigated by using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Seven sources were identified, and traffic related emissions (including vehicle exhaust and gasoline evaporation, 29.9%) and fixed combustion (27.7%) had the large contribution to ambient VOCs. Among anthropogenic sources, fixed combustion and solvent usage in painting were the large contributors to O<sub>3</sub> formation, accounting for 30.9% and 18.3%, respectively, which should have high priorities on source reduction. This study provides scientific advices for future O<sub>3</sub> pollution control strategies in Leshan, which can be extended to other cities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
