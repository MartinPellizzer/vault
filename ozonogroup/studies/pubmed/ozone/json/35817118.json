In the present work, a deep study was performed about the reactivity of BPF and BPS with ozone and hydroxyl radical. Firstly, the second order rate constants of ozone with the di-protonated, mono-protonated and deprotonated species of both bisphenols were determined to be 2.38 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>, 1.31 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> and 1.43 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for BPF and 5.01, 2.82 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> and 1.09 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for BPS. Then, the second order rate constants for the reaction of hydroxyl radical with BPF and BPS were established through UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV experiments at pH 7, resulting in the values of 8.60 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> and 6.60 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Finally, a study regarding the transformation products (TPs) from the reaction of both bisphenols with molecular ozone and hydroxyl radical was also performed. Hydroxylation in the ortho position of the phenol rings was observed as main degradation pathway. Additionally, most of the TPs were accumulated over the reactions at relatively high oxidant doses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
