This study sampled three commercial Chinese restaurants and a food plant in Shenzhen to analyze the emission characteristics of PAHs, especially the alkyl PAHs in both gas and particle phases. The results showed that the <i>\u03c1</i>(total PAHs)in the particle and gas phase were (1381.6\u00b1140.5) ng\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, (1030.2\u00b1116.4) ng\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, (908.3\u00b1111.9) ng\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and (838.0\u00b193.5) ng\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in the food plant, Sichuan, Cantonese, and Zhejiang restaurants, respectively. More than 60% of the PAHs were distributed in the gas phase, especially the lower molecular weight PAHs (lower than Chrysene). The gas phase proportion of naphthalene was the highest, with over 75% of it distributed in the gas phase. However, the PAHs with a higher molecular weight than that of benzo(b)fluorescence were mainly distributed in the particle phase. The total concentration of alkyl PAHs emitted from cooking was much lower than that of the corresponding parent PAHs, and the distribution characteristics of alkyl PAHs were quite different from those of other emission sources. The linear fitting of lg<i>K</i><sub>p</sub> and lg<i>P</i><sub>L</sub> showed that the slopes of the three commercial restaurants ranged from -0.25 to -0.28, whereas for the food plant, the value was -0.18, which indicates that the gas-particle partitioning of PAHs were not in equilibrium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Shenzhen Institute, Peking University, Shenzhen 518057, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan-Ju", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Shenzhen Institute, Peking University, Shenzhen 518057, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ai-Hua", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Shenzhen Institute, Peking University, Shenzhen 518057, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Meng-Xue", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Shenzhen Institute, Peking University, Shenzhen 518057, China."}], "LastName": "Luan", "ForeName": "Sheng-Ji", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Shenzhen Institute, Peking University, Shenzhen 518057, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhi", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35258194", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202107169"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
