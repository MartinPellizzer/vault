Standards of \u03b1-acyloxyhydroperoxy aldehydes were prepared by liquid-phase ozonolysis of cyclohexene in the presence of carboxylic acids. Stabilized Criegee intermediate (SCI), a by-product of the ozone attack on the cyclohexene double bond, reacted with the selected carboxylic acids (SCI scavengers) leading to the formation of \u03b1-acyloxyhydroperoxy aldehydes. Ionization conditions were optimized. [M\u2009+\u2009H](+) ions were not formed in ESI; consequently, \u03b1-acyloxyhydroperoxy aldehydes were identified as their ammonia adducts for the first time. On the other hand, atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization has led to decomposition of the compounds of interest. Analysis of the mass spectra (MS(2) and MS(3)) of the [M\u2009+\u2009NH(4)](+) ions allowed recognizing the fragmentation pathways, common for all of the compounds under study. In order to get detailed insights into the fragmentation mechanism, a number of isotopically labeled analogs were also studied. To confirm that the fragmentation mechanism allows predicting the mass spectrum of different \u03b1-acyloxyhydroperoxy aldehydes, ozonolysis of \u03b1-pinene, a very important secondary organic aerosol precursor, was carried out. Spectra of the two ammonium cationized \u03b1-acyloxyhydroperoxy aldehydes prepared with \u03b1-pinene, cis-pinonic acid as well as pinic acid were predicted very accurately. Possible applications of the method developed for the analysis of \u03b1-acyloxyhydroperoxy aldehydes in SOA samples, as well as other compounds containing hydroperoxide moiety are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, al. \u017bwirki i Wigury 101, 02-089, Warsaw, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Witkowski", "ForeName": "Bart\u0142omiej", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gierczak", "ForeName": "Tomasz", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9504818", "ISSNLinking": "1076-5174"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12L0P8F7GN", "NameOfSubstance": "cyclohexene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23303750", "10.1002/jms.3130"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
