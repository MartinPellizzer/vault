One clone (NC-S) is highly sensitive to O(3) and the other (NC-R) is highly resistant. The system relies on periodic measurement of foliar injury, foliar chlorophyll, and forage production of NC-S and NC-R grown in 15-liter pots throughout a summer season. Relative amounts of foliar injury and ratios (NC-S/NC-R) for chlorophyll and forage weight can be used to estimate biologically effective ambient O(3) concentrations. The effect of variation in rooting media formulation and fertilizer rate on response of NC-S and NC-R to ambient O(3) was determined in the present study. In the rooting medium experiment, clover was grown in three mixtures of sandy loam topsoil:course washed sand:Metro Mix 220 (ratios (by volume) of 2:1:1, 2:1:5, and 6:1:1). In the fertilizer experiment, clover was grown in the 2:1:1 medium at four fertilizer rates (soluble 5-11-26 (N-P-K) at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g per pot). Ozone caused more foliar injury, more chlorosis, and a greater decrease in forage production of NC-S than of NC-R in all studies. Rooting media treatments affected both clones similarly and occasional clone x media interactions were judged to be random. Forage production by NC-S, relative to that of NC-R, was generally greater in the 0.0 fertilizer treatment, but the forage ratios were similar at all other fertilizer treatments. The relative response of NC-S and NC-R to O(3) is fairly stable under cultural conditions that support normal plant growth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Pathology Department, USDA-ARS, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heagle", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091458", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)00018-m", "026974919500018M"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
