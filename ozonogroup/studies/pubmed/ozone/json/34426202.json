However, the annual mean ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations in Taiwan had leveled off for more than a decade. Furthermore, the significant cuts in precursors did lead to reduction in episodic days (O<sub>3</sub>\u2265 100\u00a0ppbv) over time, implying the weakened photochemical production of O<sub>3</sub>. Simultaneously, the number of low O<sub>3</sub> days (O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0ppbv) also decreased due to weakened NO titration. Nevertheless, the reduction of both high and low O<sub>3</sub> days resulted in an increase in the number of medium O<sub>3</sub> days (O<sub>3</sub> from 60-80\u00a0ppbv). While the nighttime mean O<sub>3</sub> continued to increase, the daytime mean O<sub>3</sub> leveled off and coincided with the marine background concentration of approximately 40\u00a0ppbv, revealing a gradual decrease in the daytime-nighttime mean O<sub>3</sub> difference. In addition to multiple chemical reasons, transboundary O<sub>3</sub> from Asian continental outflow is thought to be another major contributor to the prolonged leveling of domestic O<sub>3</sub>. To quantitatively illustrate the role of the transboundary effect, model simulations were conducted in two ways: one assessed the time percentage of a year affected by the transboundary influence; and the other involved decoupling the transboundary O<sub>3</sub> from the domestically produced O<sub>3</sub> to quantify the amount of domestic O<sub>3</sub> that can be mitigated by prescribing scenarios; namely, the so-called sensitivity test. The sensitivity test suggests that although controlling domestic emissions is still vital to contain O<sub>3</sub> under weak transboundary conditions, the overall O<sub>3</sub> averages and the long-term trend at the island scale are closely associated with the transboundary influence. The gradual increased medium O<sub>3</sub> concentrations to approximate the marine background level could imply that future O<sub>3</sub> concentration on the island will be more influenced more by the transboundary conditions and less relevant to the domestic containment measures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
