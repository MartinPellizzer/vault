The phenol isotherms for virgin GAC could be well represented by the Langmuir equation. Direct ozonation of GAC introduced large amounts of acidic surface oxygen groups, which caused a decrease in the phenol uptake. Thermogravimetric methods were used to investigate the mechanism of phenol adsorption onto virgin and ozonated carbons. Thermal regeneration was carried out at 1123K using nitrogen (pyrolysis alone) or nitrogen and carbon dioxide (pyrolysis plus oxidation). Results showed that spent carbons do not recover their adsorption characteristics when heated under inert conditions whereas carbon dioxide regeneration was effective at about 15% wt burn-off. Regeneration of GAC was also carried out with ozone as oxidizing gas at room temperature. Ozone dose and the nature of GAC have much influence on the regeneration performance. For an individual GAC there exits an optimum ozone dose for which phenol is eliminated together with most of its oxidation by-products without incurring in carbon surface chemical alterations. However, if excessive ozone is applied some acidic surface groups are formed on the GAC, thereby decreasing the adsorption capacity for phenol. Results showed that spent carbons can recover most of their adsorption characteristics and specific surface areas when regenerated through a number of adsorption-ozone regeneration cycles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Energ\u00e9tica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Extremadura, Avda Elvas S/N, Badajoz 06071, Spain. pmalvarez@unex.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beltr\u00e1n", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez-Serrano", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaramillo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "339NCG44TV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15087197", "10.1016/j.watres.2004.01.030", "S0043135404000533"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
