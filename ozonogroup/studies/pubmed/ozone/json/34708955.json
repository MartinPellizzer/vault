Suggestions for the prevention and treatment of VOCs from domestic sources were developed and proposed. The results showed that the total VOCs emission inventory from domestic sources in China in 2018 was 2518 kt. Architectural decoration, asphalt road paving, cooking, and rural household biomass use source were the four largest contributors, accounting for 69.22% of the total emissions. Chemical household products and urban and rural coal use contributed equally, accounting for 10.43% and 9.98%, respectively, whilst car repair accounted for 7.75%. Shandong, Sichuan, Henan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Hebei were the six provinces that contributed the most(36.01%). During the 2010-2018 period, China's domestic VOCs emissions increased at a rate of 0.43%, and after reaching a peak in 2013, the emissions began to decline at a rate of 2.23%. The reason for the decline was that, on the one hand, the cleaner energy consumption of residents made a contribution to the gradual reduction of domestic coal and biomass consumption. On the other hand, the gradual saturation of housing construction in some areas, which led to a decrease in the annual construction of the country. It is recommended to promote the comprehensive management of architectural decoration, cooking methods, and car repair, while paying attention to the VOCs emissions from asphalt road paving. Meanwhile, continue to optimize the energy use structure of domestic sources, and promote the pollution control of civil coal and household biomass combustion in accordance with local regulations and multiple measures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation
