The production of O<sub>3</sub> shows a highly nonlinear relationship with its precursors volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>). In this study, we conducted online observations of O<sub>3</sub>, VOCs, and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> at an urban site in downtown Nanjing from April to September of 2020 and 2021. The average concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors between these two years were compared, and then the O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> sensitivity and the VOCs sources were analyzed using the observation-based box model (OBM) and positive matrix factorization (PMF), respectively. The results showed that the mean daily maximum O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, VOCs, and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> concentrations decreased by 7% (<i>P</i>=0.031), 17.6% (<i>P</i><0.001), and 14.0% (<i>P</i>=0.004) from April to September of 2021 compared with those from the same period in 2020, respectively. The average relative incremental reactivity (RIR) values of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and anthropogenic VOCs during the O<sub>3</sub> non-attainment days in 2020 and 2021 were 0.17 and 0.14 and 0.21 and 0.14, respectively. The positive RIR values of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs indicated that O<sub>3</sub> production was controlled by both VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>. The O<sub>3</sub> production potential contours (EKMA curves) based on the 50\u00d750 scenario simulations also supported this conclusion. The PMF results showed that industrial and traffic-related emissions were the main sources of VOCs. The five PMF-resolved factors were identified as industrial emissions, including industrial liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) use, the benzene-related industry, petrochemistry, toluene-related industry, and solvent and paint use, which contributed 55%-57% of the average mass concentration of total VOCs. The summed relative contributions of vehicular exhaust and gasoline evaporation were 43%-45%. Petrochemistry and solvent and paint use showed the two highest RIR values, suggesting that VOCs from these two sources should be reduced with priority to control O<sub>3</sub>. With the implementation of VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> control measures, the O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> sensitivity and VOCs sources have changed, and therefore we still need to follow their variations in the future to timely adjust O<sub>3</sub> control strategies during the 14<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Nanjing Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210013, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Nanjing Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210013, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Nanjing Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210013, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yi-Yong", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Nanjing Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210013, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhe-Hai", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37040945", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202204220"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
