Higher CO levels (90 ppm) were found to significantly change the chemical composition of SOA (prompting monomers while reducing oligomer formation) without causing much change in the overall SOA mass. Based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, heterogeneous chemical conversions between preformed and newly formed SOA were the major pathways of SOA formation in the presence of MOI particles. Furthermore, MOI particles had an enhancing effect on SOA formation at 1% relative humidity (RH) but a negligible effect at higher RH (10 and 55%). The enhancing effect was attributed to the formation of multifunctional products resulting from high functionalization of preformed and newly formed SOA. The negligible effect observed was ascribed to the cleavage of unstable oligomers as a result of the reversible oligomerization of preformed and newly formed SOA. Even so, MOI particles could still affect the composition of newly formed SOA. These results highlight the need to account for the significant effect of mixed gaseous and particulate pollutants on both SOA constituents and their evolution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
