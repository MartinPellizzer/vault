Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the precursors of secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> formation. An investigation of characteristics, sources and health risks assessment of VOCs was carried out at the urban area of Zhengzhou from 1<sup>st</sup> to 31<sup>st</sup> December, 2019. The mean concentrations of total detected VOCs were 48.8 \u00b1 23.0 ppbv. Alkanes (22.0 \u00b1 10.4 ppbv), halocarbons (8.1 \u00b1 3.9 ppbv) and aromatics (6.5 \u00b1 3.9 ppbv) were the predominant VOC species, followed by alkenes (5.1 \u00b1 3.3 ppbv), oxygenated VOCs (3.6 \u00b1 1.8 ppbv), alkyne (3.5 \u00b1 1.9, ppbv) and sulfide (0.5 \u00b1 0.9 ppbv). The Positive Matrix Factorization model was used to identify and apportion VOCs sources. Five major sources of VOCs were identified as vehicular exhaust, industrial processes, combustion, fuel evaporation, and solvent use. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk values of species were calculated. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of almost all air toxics increased during haze days. The total non-carcinogenic risks exceeded the acceptable ranges. Most VOC species posed no non-carcinogenic risk during three haze events. The carcinogenic risks of chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, benzyl chloride, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene, benzene and naphthalene were above the acceptable level (1.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u00a010<sup>-6</sup>) but below the tolerable risk level (1.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u00a010<sup>-4</sup>). Industrial emission was the major contributor to non-carcinogenic, and solvent use was the major contributor to carcinogenic risks."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
