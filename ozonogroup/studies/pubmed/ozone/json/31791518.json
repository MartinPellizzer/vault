The Ce-OMS-2 samples were prepared with different fill percentages by means of a hydrothermal approach (i.e. 80%, 70%, 50% and 30%). Ce-OMS-2 with 80% fill percentage (Ce-OMS-2-80%) showed ozone conversion of 97%, and a lifetime experiment carried out for more than 20\u202fdays showed that the activity of the catalyst still remained satisfactorily high (91%). For Ce-OMS-2-80%, Mn ions in the framework as well as K ions in the tunnel sites were replaced by Ce<sup>4+</sup>, while for the others only Mn ions were replaced. O<sub>2</sub>-TPD and H<sub>2</sub>-TPR measurements proved that the Ce-OMS-2-80% catalyst possessed the greatest number of mobile surface oxygen species. XPS and XAFS showed that increasing the fill percentage can reduce the AOS of Mn and augment the amount of oxygen vacancies. The active sites, which accelerate the elimination of O<sub>3</sub>, can be enriched by increasing the oxygen vacancies. These findings indicate that increasing ozone removal can be achieved by tuning the fill percentage in the hydrothermal synthesis process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
