The proposed design combines a sand filter/constructed wetland with additional and more advanced treatment technologies (UV degradation, enhanced adsorption to the solid phase, e.g., an engineered substrate) to increase the elimination of recalcitrant compounds. The removal of five micropollutants with different physico-chemical characteristics (three pharmaceuticals: diclofenac, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, one pesticide: mecoprop, and one corrosion inhibitor: benzotriazole) was studied to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system. Separate batch experiments were conducted to assess the removal efficiency of UV degradation and adsorption. The efficiency of each individual process was substance-specific. No process was effective on all the compounds tested, although elimination rates over 80% using light expanded clay aggregate (an engineered material) were observed. A laboratory-scale flow-through setup was used to evaluate interactions when removal processes were combined. Four of the studied compounds were partially eliminated, with poor removal of the fifth (benzotriazole). The energy requirements for a field-scale installation were estimated to be the same order of magnitude as those of ozonation and powdered activated carbon treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut d'ing\u00e9nierie de l'environnement, Facult\u00e9 de l'environnement naturel, architectural et construit, Ecole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. luca.rossi@epfl.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rossi", "ForeName": "Luca", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Queloz", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brovelli", "ForeName": "Alessandro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margot", "ForeName": "Jonas", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barry", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "144O8QL0L1", "NameOfSubstance": "Diclofenac"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33CM23913M", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamazepine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "74N8TKR9P8", "NameOfSubstance": "mecoprop"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "86110UXM5Y", "NameOfSubstance": "benzotriazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D888C394VO", "NameOfSubstance": "2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JE42381TNV", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethoxazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbamazepine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diclofenac"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triazoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wetlands"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Tauxe AW (2005) Wastewaters: Occurrence of pharmaceutical substances and genotoxicity.
