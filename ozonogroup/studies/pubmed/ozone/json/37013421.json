It has the virtues of high detectivity and sensitivity, which have been extensively studied for low-trace molecule detection. In the choices of SERS substrate materials, low-cost and abundant reserved transition metal oxide/chalcogenide materials have been regarded as promising substitutes for noble metals; however, their inferior SERS enhancement severely limits their practical application. Herein, a class of MoS<sub>2</sub>/MoO<sub><i>x</i></sub> heterostructures have been demonstrated with significantly improved SERS performance. Experimentally, MoS<sub>2</sub>/MoO<sub><i>x</i></sub> heterostructures were prepared by precisely controlled oxidation of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanospheres in an ultraviolet-ozone environment, and the optimal SERS substrate was obtained with 14 hours of ultraviolet-ozone irradiation. SERS measurements revealed superior SERS performance with a detection limit of 10<sup>-7</sup> M (rhodamine 6G) and an enhancement factor of 7.477 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> (R6G@10<sup>-7</sup> M) could be obtained. Finally, the intuitive SERS enhancement mechanism was investigated <i>via</i> energy band analysis. It revealed that the constructed heterostructures enhanced the electron-hole separation, and the electrons were successively transferred to the analytes and significantly promoted the molecular polarizability, improving the SERS performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0008-9167-4313"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microelectronic Science and Engineering, School of Physical Science and Technology, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, P.
