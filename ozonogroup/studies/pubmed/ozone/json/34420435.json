Factors such as low gluten content and the addition of nontraditional ingredients in baking affect the quality of wheat flour and may limit its use in baking. With the increasing trend of \"clean label\" products, it may be interesting to develop and use physical processes to improve the quality of wheat flour and avoid the use of chemical additives. High hydrostatic pressure, non-thermal plasma, ultrasound, ozonation, ultraviolet light, and pulsed light treatments are non-thermal emerging technologies (NTETs) that have been studied for this purpose. They were originally developed to inactivate microorganisms and enzymes in foods. Additionally, these technologies can be used at low temperatures to modify the most important component of wheat flour, i.e., gluten and its fractions, which are responsible for the rheological properties of wheat flour dough. Thus, this review focuses on the effects of these NTETs by considering the following factors: (1) the technological properties of gluten, (2) gluten-starch interactions, (3) possible effects of NTETs on minor components of flours, and (4) the quality of wheat flour and the resulting final products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9475-4289"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering and Technology, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Acre (IFAC), Xapuri, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Barros", "ForeName": "Jefferson Henrique Tiago", "Initials": "JHT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7717-1244"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering and Technology, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Carvalho Oliveira", "ForeName": "Ludmilla", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7740-0449"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering and Technology, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Cristianini", "ForeName": "Marcelo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0911-5889"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering and Technology, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Steel", "ForeName": "Caroline Joy", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8002-80-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glutens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34420435", "10.1080/10408398.2021.1966380"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
