The average particulate nitrate concentrations were 6.20 and 9.80 microg m(-3), while the average gaseous nitric acid concentrations were 1.14 and 6.70 microg m(-3) in the winter and summer seasons, respectively. The average sulfate concentrations were 15.32 microg m(-3) during the winter and 25.10 microg m(-3) during the summer season. The highest average concentration ratio of gaseous nitric acid to total nitrate was found during the summer season. Particulate sulfate and nitrate and gaseous nitric acid concentrations were relatively higher in the daytime than those in the nighttime. Sulfur conversion ratio (Fs) and nitrogen conversion ratio (Fn) defined in the text were calculated from the field measurement data. Sulfur conversion ratio (Fs) and nitrogen conversion ratio (Fn) in the summer were about 2.22 and 2.97 times higher than those in the winter season, respectively. Moreover, sulfur conversion ratio (Fs) and nitrogen conversion ratio (Fn) were higher in the daytime than those in the nighttime during the both seasons. The sulfur conversion ratio (Fs) increases with increasing ozone concentration and relative humidity. This indicates that the droplet phase reactions and gas phase reactions are important for the oxidation of SO2 to sulfate. Moreover, the nitrogen conversion ratio (Fn) increases with increasing ozone concentration, and the gas phase reactions are important and predominant for the oxidation of NO2 to nitrate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza, Egypt. khoder_55@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khoder", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "411VRN1TV4", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Interpretation, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12430655", "10.1016/s0045-6535(02)00391-0", "S0045-6535(02)00391-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
