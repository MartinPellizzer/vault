However, there may be situations where this method is not feasible due to technical issues, such as poor vein condition or anemia. As an alternative method, pre-ozonized solutions, such as 0.9% saline solution, have been investigated for their ease of preparation and administration. However, concerns have been raised regarding the formation of chlorine compounds. Currently, there is no available literature on the treatment potential of pre-ozonized glucose solution. The objective of this study is to compare and evaluate the chemical changes induced by ozonization of a 5% glucose solution and determine if any toxic compounds are produced. Our findings indicate that the chemical alterations following ozone infusion are quantitatively minimal and pose a negligible risk in terms of safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Martinelli et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ozone Therapy Unit, Ospedale San Pietro Fatebenefratelli, Rome, ITA."}], "LastName": "Martinelli", "ForeName": "Mauro", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Ospedale San Pietro Fatebenefratelli, Rome, ITA."}], "LastName": "Romanello", "ForeName": "Daniele", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "The ozone paradox: ozone is a strong oxidant as well as a medical drug.
