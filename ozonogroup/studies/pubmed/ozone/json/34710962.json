This review provides a comprehensive presentation of the types and levels of VOCs, their sources and potential effects on human health and the environment based on past and current observations made at tropical sites. Isoprene was found to be the dominant biogenic VOC in the tropics. Tropical broad leaf evergreen trees are the main emitters of isoprene, making up more than 70% of the total emissions. The VOCs found in the tropical remote marine atmosphere included isoprene (>100\u00a0ppt), dimethyl sulfide (\u2264100\u00a0ppt) and halocarbons, i.e. bromoform (\u22648.4\u00a0ppt), dibromomethane (\u22642.7\u00a0ppt) and dibromochloromethane (\u22641.6\u00a0ppt). VOCs such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are the most monitored anthropogenic VOCs and are present mainly due to motor vehicles emissions. Additionally, biomass burning contributes to anthropogenic VOCs, especially high molecular weight VOCs, e.g. methanol and acetonitrile. The relative contributions of VOC species to ozone are determined through the level of the Ozone Formation Potential (OFP) of different species. Emissions of VOCs (e.g. very short-lived halogenated gases) in the tropics are capable of contributing to stratospheric ozone depletion. BTEX has been identified as the main types of VOCs that are associated with the cancer risk in urban areas in tropical regions. Finally, future studies related to VOCs in the tropics and their associated health risks are needed to address these concerns."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
