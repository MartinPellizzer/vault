Its emissions are produced by both natural and anthropogenic sources; however, soils are among the most important sources of NO. Nitric oxide plays a decisive role in environmental-atmospheric chemistry by controlling the tropospheric photochemical production of ozone and regulates formation of various oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radical (OH), which contributes to the formation of acid of precipitates. Consequently, for developing strategies to overcome the deleterious impact of NO on terrestrial ecosystem, it is mandatory to have reliable information about the exact emission mechanism and processes involved in its transformation in soil-atmospheric system. Although the formation process of NO is a complex phenomenon and depends on many physicochemical characteristics, such as organic matter, soil pH, soil moisture, soil temperature, etc., this review provides comprehensive updates about the emission characteristics and biogeochemical transformation mechanism of NO. Moreover, this article will also be helpful to understand the processes involved in the consumption of NO in soils. Further studies describing the functions of NO in biological system are also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environment, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}], "LastName": "Shakoor", "ForeName": "Awais", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State-Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Biology and Utilization, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}], "LastName": "Abdullah", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS-Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and the Environments, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, China."}], "LastName": "Yousaf", "ForeName": "Balal", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environment, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China."}], "LastName": "Amina"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environment, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, 230036, China. yhma@ahau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Youhua", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["27771880", "10.1007/s11356-016-7823-6", "10.1007/s11356-016-7823-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
