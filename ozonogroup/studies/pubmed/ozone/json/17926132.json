Oxalic acid-assimilating bacterium, Pandoraea sp. strain EBR-01, was newly isolated from soil under bamboo grove and was identified to be a member of the genus Pandoraea by physicochemical and biochemical tests including 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The bacterium was grown optimally at pH 7 and temperature of 30 degrees C under the laboratory conditions. Reactive Red 120 (RR120), Reactive Green 19 (RG19), Reactive Black 5 (RB5) and Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) were used in degradation experiments. At the initial reactive dye concentrations of 500 mg/l and the ozonation time of 80 min, it was confirmed that 75-90 mg/l oxalic acid was generated from reactive dyes by ozonation. Microbial treatment using EBR-01 greatly decreased the amount of oxalic acid in the mixture after 48 h, but it was not removed completely. TOC/TOC(0) of reactive dye solutions was also decreased to 80-90% and 20-40% by ozonation and microbial treatment using EBR-01, respectively. The study confirmed that consecutive treatments by ozone and microorganisms are efficient methods to mineralize reactive dyes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life System, Institute of Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, 2-1 Minamijosanjia-cho, Tokushima, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurosumi", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaneko", "ForeName": "Erika", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Yoshitoshi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biodegradation", "NlmUniqueID": "9100834", "ISSNLinking": "0923-9820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E7R5L6H31", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17926132", "10.1007/s10532-007-9153-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
