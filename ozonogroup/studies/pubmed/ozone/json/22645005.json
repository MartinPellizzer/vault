A detailed air pollution database was observed from two monitoring stations. The data period used was 2008 and 2009, around 210,000 data, selected for its pollution and meteorological statistics, which are very representative of the region. Data were collected every 15 min, however hourly values were used to analyse the seasonal and daily ozone, NO, NO(2) and OX cycles. The variation of OX concentrations with NO(x) is investigated, for the first time, in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. The concentration of OX was calculated using the sum of a NO(x)-independent 'regional' contribution (i.e. the O(3) background), and a linearly NO(x)-dependent 'local' contribution. Monthly dependence of regional and local OX concentration was observed to determine when the maximum values may be expected. The variation of OX concentrations with levels of NO(x) was also measured, in order to pinpoint the atmospheric sources of OX in the polluted areas. The ratios [NO(2)]/[OX] and [NO(2)]/[NO(x)] vs. [NO(x)] were analysed to find the fraction of OX in the form of NO(2), and the possible source of the local NO(x)-dependent contribution, respectively. The progressive increase of the ratio [NO(2)]/[OX] with [NO(x)] observed shows a greater proportion of OX in the form of NO(2) as the level of NO( x ) increases. The higher measured values in the ratio [NO(2)]/[NO(x)] should not be attributed to NO(x) emissions by vehicles; they could be explained by industrial emission, termolecular reactions or formaldehyde and HONO directly emitted by vehicles exhausts. We also estimate the rate of NO(2) photolysis, J (NO(2)) = 0.18-0.64 min(-1), a key atmospheric reaction that influence O(3) production and then the regional air quality. The first surface plot study of annual variation of the daily mean oxidant levels, obtained for this polluted area may be used to improve the atmospheric photochemical dynamic in this region of the Iberian Peninsula where there are undeniable air quality problems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica, Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad de Castilla la Mancha, Avenida Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Notario", "ForeName": "Alberto", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bravo", "ForeName": "Iv\u00e1n", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adame", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Antonio", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00edaz-de-Mera", "ForeName": "Yolanda", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aranda", "ForeName": "Alfonso", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Diana", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2011 May 1;409(11):2163-78", "ArticleIdList": ["21377712"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2003;10(1):19-23", "ArticleIdList": ["12635954"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2002;118(2):167-86", "ArticleIdList": ["11939281"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2008 Jan;70(5):841-9", "ArticleIdList": ["17764716"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2010 Sep 15;408(20):4795-806", "ArticleIdList": ["20619880"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2008 Oct;15(7):584-91", "ArticleIdList": ["18712424"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2007 May;14(3):176-81", "ArticleIdList": ["17561776"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2010 Feb;17(2):355-68", "ArticleIdList": ["19153676"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2012 Jan;19(1):186-200", "ArticleIdList": ["21717169"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22645005", "10.1007/s11356-012-0974-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
