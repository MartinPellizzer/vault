Here we compared the trends of two metrics widely used to protect forests against negative impacts of ozone pollution, the AOT40 (Accumulated Ozone over Threshold of 40\u202fppb) which only depends on surface air ozone concentrations, and the POD (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose) which relies on the amount of ozone uptaken by plants through stomata. Using a chemistry transport model, driven by anthropogenic emission inventories, we found that European-averaged ground-level ozone concentrations significantly declined (-1.6%) over the time period 2000-2014, following successful control strategies to reduce the ozone precursors emission; as a consequence, the AOT40 metric declined (-22%). In contrast, climate change increased both growing season length (~7\u202fdays/decade) and stomatal conductance and thus enhanced the stomatal ozone uptake by forests (5.9%), leading to an overall increase of potential ozone damage on plants, despite the reduction in ozone concentrations. Our results suggest that stomatal-flux based strategies of forest protection against ozone in a changing climate require a proper consideration of the duration of the growing season with a better estimation of start and end of the growing season."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
