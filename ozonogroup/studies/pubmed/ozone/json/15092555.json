Net photosynthesis (net CO2 uptake), measured before and after O3 fumigation, showed significantly different responses for leaves of different age. The oldest active leaf was the most sensitive to O3. Net photosynthesis was depressed after 2 h with 0.075 ppm (150 microg m(-3)) O3. For leaves exposed to 0.150 ppm (300 microg m(-3)) O3 for 2 h, net photosynthesis was reduced significantly for 4 h, after which recovery occurred, nearly reaching the preexposure level 19 h after the exposure. Dark respiration was initially more than doubled after exposure to 0.130 ppm (260 microg m(-3)) O3. There was no visible injury after any of the experiments. The results indicate that O3 may cause crop losses through effects on photosynthesis even in Scandinavia, where a typical O3 episode lasts 1 to 2 h, and the concentration seldom exceeds 0.150 ppm."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Phytotron, Department of Biology, University of Oslo, Blindern, Oslo, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myhre", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forberg", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aarnes", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nilsen", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092555", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90039-5", "0269749188900395"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
