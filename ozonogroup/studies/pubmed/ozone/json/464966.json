Flight attendants, especially contact lens wearers, have complained about eye discomfort in aircraft. The purpose of this study was to evaluate some of the conditions in aircraft that might influence their eye comfort. A questionnaire on eye comfort was developed in conjunction with the Air Safety Department of the Association of Flight Attendants and distributed through its Flightlog magazine. Of the 774 respondents, 95% reported some eye discomfort in aircraft. It is significant that both those who did and who did wear contact lenses reported similar eye problems. The most common eye problems reported were conjunctival redness and dried eyes. Smoking was indicated by the respondents to be the most noticeable factor causing eye symptoms. Aircraft cabin conditions are discussed, including relative humidity, atmospheric oxygen, and ozone concentration. Since air passengers are exposed to the same aircraft conditions as the attendants, they probably would manifest similar eye problems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eng", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Aviat Space Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7501714", "ISSNLinking": "0095-6562"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerospace Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contact Lenses"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eye Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eyeglasses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["464966"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
