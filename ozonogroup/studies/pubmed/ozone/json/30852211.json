Only a few studies evaluated the associations between air pollution and SLE. We conducted a population-based cohort study in Taiwan to examine the associations of air pollution with SLE. A total of 682,208 individuals aged 18-70\u202fyears were retrieved from National Health Insurance Research Database. We applied 1-km resolution land use regression and satellite-based models to estimate air pollutant concentrations during 2001-2010. The mixed effect Cox models with time-dependent variables were performed to estimate the associations between air pollution and SLE, as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We identified 1292 newly diagnosed SLE patients with average age of 43.26\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.64\u202fyears, most of them were female. There were positive associations of SLE with exposure to a 9.76\u202fppb increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), a 0.20\u202fppm increase in carbon monoxide (CO), and a 10.2\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) (HR\u202f=\u202f1.21, 95% CI: 1.08-1.36, HR\u202f=\u202f1.44, 95% CI: 1.31-1.59, and HR\u202f=\u202f1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23, respectively). Additionally, we observed negative associations with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). According to the exposure-response relationships, exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> between 28 and 38\u202fppb, exposure to CO above 0.6\u202fppm, and exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> between 18 and 46\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> were positively associated with SLE. The results suggested that long-term exposure to traffic-related gaseous air pollutants (NO<sub>2</sub> and CO) less than current National Ambient Air Quality Standards and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are significantly associated with the risk of SLE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
