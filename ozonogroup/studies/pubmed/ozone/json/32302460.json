Its efficacy against stored product insect pests is well documented. In the midst of the common bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) outbreak, claims were made that ozone gas was effective for their control. This study was conducted to determine baseline ozone concentrations and exposure times required for the control of an insecticide-susceptible C. lectularius strain under laboratory conditions. Dichlorvos (DDVP), an organophosphate class fumigant insecticide was used as a positive control.", "Nymphs and adults were more susceptible to ozone than eggs. Complete (100%) nymph and adult mortality was achieved at an ozone concentration (C) of 1500\u2009ppm and exposure time (T) of 180\u2009min, or concentration \u00d7 time product (CT) of 270\u2009000\u2009ppm-min, whereas eggs required an eightfold higher CT (2 040\u2009000\u2009ppm-min). DDVP vapor was 2070-, 2542- and 450-fold more potent than ozone, against nymphs, adults and eggs, respectively.", "Baseline ozone toxicity data provide insights on the practicality of using this gas for the management of common bed bugs. High ozone CT products required for C. lectularius control, particularly eggs, suggest that its use for treating infested human dwellings is not feasible due to logistic, safety and monetary concerns. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Insects Limited, Inc., Westfield, IN, USA."}], "LastName": "Feston", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5156-4453"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA."}], "LastName": "Gaire", "ForeName": "Sudip", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA."}], "LastName": "Fardisi", "ForeName": "Mahsa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA."}], "LastName": "Mason", "ForeName": "Linda J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4002-0914"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA."}], "LastName": "Gondhalekar", "ForeName": "Ameya D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Center for Urban and Industrial Pest Management", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Osmun Innovation Funds", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Purdue University AgSEED Grant Program", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bedbugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Laboratories"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nymph"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Doggett SL, Miller DM and Lee CY, Advances in the Biology and Management of Modern Bed Bugs.
