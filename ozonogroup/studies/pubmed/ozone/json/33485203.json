This study investigated atmospheric and seawater methyl halides (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, CH<sub>3</sub>Br, and CH<sub>3</sub>I) in the western Pacific Ocean between 2\u00b0N and 24\u00b0N. Increases in methyl halides in the atmosphere were likely to have originated from Southeast Asian regions. Elevated CH<sub>3</sub>I concentrations in seawater were mainly produced photochemically from dissolved organic carbon. Maximum methyl halide and chlorophyll a levels in the upper water column (0-200\u00a0m) were linked to biological activity and downwelling or upwelling caused by cold and warm eddies. Ship-based incubation experiments showed that nutrient supplementation promoted methyl halide emissions. The elevated methyl halide production was associated with increases in phytoplankton such as diatoms. The mean fluxes of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, CH<sub>3</sub>Br, and CH<sub>3</sub>I in study area of during the cruise were 82.91, 4.70, and 3.50\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The estimated emissions of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, CH<sub>3</sub>Br, and CH<sub>3</sub>I in the western Pacific Ocean accounted for 0.67%, 0.79% and 0.09% of global oceanic emissions, respectively, indicating that the open sea contribute insignificantly to the global oceanic emissions of these gases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
