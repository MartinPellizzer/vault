Alternative fumigation with methyl bromide is subject to U.S. and international restrictions due to its ozone-depleting properties. Methyl iodide, however, does not pose a risk to the ozone layer and has previously been demonstrated as a fumigant for fungi, insects, and nematodes. Until now, methyl iodide has not been evaluated against Bacillus anthracis. Sterne strain Bacillus anthracis spores were subjected to methyl iodide fumigation at room temperature and at 550C. Efficacy was measured on a log-scale with a 6-log reduction in CFUs being considered successful compared to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency biocide standard. Such efficacies were obtained after just one hour at 55 \u00b0C and after 12 hours at room temperature. No detrimental effects were observed on glassware, PTFE O-rings, or stainless steel. This is the first reported efficacy of methyl iodide in the reduction of Bacillus anthracis spore contamination at ambient and elevated temperatures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sutton", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kane", "ForeName": "Staci R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wollard", "ForeName": "Jessica R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0405525", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0892"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Iodinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DAT010ZJSR", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl iodide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus anthracis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Iodinated"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spores, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26502561"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
