Fully understanding the VOCs emission is crucial for making regulations to improve air quality. This study reviews the published studies on atmospheric VOCs concentration observations in China and observation-based estimation of China's VOCs emission strengths and emission source structures. The results reveal that direct sampling and stainless-steel-tank sampling are the most commonly used methods for online and offline observations in China, respectively. The GC-MS/FID is the most commonly used VOCs measuring instrument in China (in 60.8% of the studies we summarized). Numerous studies conducted observation campaigns in urban areas (76.2%) than in suburban (17.1%), rural (18.1%), and background areas (14.3%) in China. Moreover, observation sites are largely set in eastern China (83.8%). Though there are published studies reporting observation-based China's VOCs emission investigation, these kinds of studies are still limited, and gaps are found between the results of top-down investigation and bottom-up inventories of VOCs emissions in China. In order to enhance the observation-based VOCs emission investigations in China, this study suggests future improvements including: (1) development of VOCs detection techniques, (2) strengthening of atmospheric VOCs observations, (3) improvement of the accuracy of observation-based VOCs emission estimations, and (4) facilitation of better VOCs emission inventories in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, P.
