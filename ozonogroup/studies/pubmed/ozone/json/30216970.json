Slit venturi was used as the cavitating device in HC reactor. The effects of process parameters such as inlet pressure, cavitation number, effluent concentration, ozone and oxygen flow rate, loading of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Fenton's reagent on the extent of reduction of TOC, COD and color were studied. Efficiency of the hybrid treatment processes were evaluated on the basis of their synergetic coefficient. It was observed that almost 17% TOC, 12% COD, and 25% color removal was obtained using HC alone at inlet pressure of 5bar and pH of 6.8. The rate of reduction of TOC and COD decreased with dilution of the samples. HC in combination with Fenton's reagent (FeSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b77H<sub>2</sub>O:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as 1:5) was most effective with reduction of 48%TOC and 38% COD in 15min and 120min respectively with almost complete decolorization (98%) of the TDI effluent. Whereas HC in combination with oxygen (2L/min) and ozone (3g/h) produced reduction of 48% TOC, 33% COD, 62% decolorization and 48% TOC, 23% COD, 88%, decolorization of TDI effluent respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
