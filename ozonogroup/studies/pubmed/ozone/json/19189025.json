We focus specifically on the mid-infrared wavelength regime (about 5-20 microm), a spectral range offering access to warm objects (about 300 K) and to spectral features that can be interpreted as signatures for biological activity (e.g. water, ozone, carbon dioxide). We review the relevant research activities aiming at the development of single-mode guided optics and the corresponding manufacturing technologies. We evaluate the experimentally achieved performance and compare it with the performance requirements for applications in various fields of astronomy. Our goal is to show a perspective for future astronomical instruments based on mid-infrared photonic devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck Institut fuer Astronomie, Heidelberg, Germany. labadie@mpia.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Labadie", "ForeName": "Lucas", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wallner", "ForeName": "Oswald", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Express", "NlmUniqueID": "101137103", "ISSNLinking": "1094-4087"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19189025", "10.1364/oe.17.001947", "176235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
