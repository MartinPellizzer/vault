We conduct multiyear simulations to account for interannual variability and characterize the near-term influence of a changing climate on tropospheric ozone-related health impacts near the year 2030, which is a policy-relevant time frame that is subject to fewer uncertainties than other approaches employed in the literature. We adopt a 2030 emissions inventory that accounts for fully implementing anthropogenic emissions controls required by federal, state, and/or local policies, which is projected to strongly influence future ozone levels. We quantify a comprehensive suite of ozone-related mortality and morbidity impacts including emergency department visits, hospital admissions, acute respiratory symptoms, and lost school days, and estimate the economic value of these impacts. Both GCMs project average daily maximum temperature to increase by 1-4\u00b0C and 1-5 ppb increases in daily 8-hr maximum ozone at 2030, though each climate scenario produces ozone levels that vary greatly over space and time. We estimate tens to thousands of additional ozone-related premature deaths and illnesses per year for these two scenarios and calculate an economic burden of these health outcomes of hundreds of millions to tens of billions of U.S. dollars (2010$).", "Near-term changes to the climate have the potential to greatly affect ground-level ozone. Using a 2030 emission inventory with regional climate fields downscaled from two general circulation models, we project mean temperature increases of 1 to 4\u00b0C and climate-driven mean daily 8-hr maximum ozone increases of 1-5 ppb, though each climate scenario produces ozone levels that vary significantly over space and time. These increased ozone levels are estimated to result in tens to thousands of ozone-related premature deaths and illnesses per year and an economic burden of hundreds of millions to tens of billions of U.S. dollars (2010$)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "LastName": "Fann", "ForeName": "Neal", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nolte", "ForeName": "Christopher G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dolwick", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Spero", "ForeName": "Tanya L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Amanda Curry", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Sharon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anenberg", "ForeName": "Susan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Government Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "economics", "epidemiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25947315", "10.1080/10962247.2014.996270"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
