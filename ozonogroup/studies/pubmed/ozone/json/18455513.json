Reduced NO formation is associated with endothelial dysfunction and with cardiovascular risk factors. Although NO downregulates the expression and activity of the pro-atherogenic enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), no previous clinical study has examined whether endogenous NO formation is inversely associated with the circulating levels of pro-MMP-9, which are associated with cardiovascular events. We examined this hypothesis in 175 healthy male subjects who were non-smokers.", "To assess NO bioavailability, the plasma concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, and cGMP were determined using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay and an enzyme immunoassay. Pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2 levels were measured in plasma samples by gelatin zymography.", "We found significant negative correlations between pro-MMP-9 levels and plasma nitrite (P=0.035, rs= -0.159), nitrate (P=0.040, rs= -0.158), and cGMP (P=0.011, rs= -0.189) concentrations. However, no significant correlations were found between pro-MMP-2 levels and the plasma concentrations of markers of NO bioavailability (all P>0.05).", "There is an inverse relationship between markers of NO formation and plasma MMP-9 levels. This finding may shed some light on the possible mechanisms involved in the increased cardiovascular risk of apparently healthy subjects with low NO bioavailability or high circulating levels of pro-MMP-9."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Avenida Bandeirantes 3900, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demacq", "ForeName": "Caroline", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Metzger", "ForeName": "Ingrid F", "Initials": "IF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerlach", "ForeName": "Raquel F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanus-Santos", "ForeName": "Jose E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Clin Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "1302422", "ISSNLinking": "0009-8981"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "MMP2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18455513", "10.1016/j.cca.2008.04.008", "S0009-8981(08)00174-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
