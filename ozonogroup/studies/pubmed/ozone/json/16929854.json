An ion exchange chromatographic method with suppressed conductivity detection for the determination of trace bromate in drinking water was developed. The separation of the bromate in drinking water was achieved on a Metrosep A Supp 5 anion exchange column and a Metrosep A Supp 4/5 Guard column with a carbonate eluent. A new dual suppressed system, an MSM II chemical suppressor combined with a CO2 suppressor, was used to suppress the background conductivity, and to improve the detection limit of bromate. Ion chromatographic experiments were carried out by using a Metrosep A Supp 5 anion exchange column with a suppressed conductivity detector and an eluent of 3.2 mmoL/L Na2CO3-1.0 mmol/L NaHCO3 at a flow rate of 0.65 mL/min. This method had good linearity (r = 0.9999) in the range of 5-100 microg/L and high precision (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 4% ) for three concentration levels of bromate. The average recoveries of the spiked samples including tap water, pure water and mineral water were 96.1%-107%, and the detection limit for bromate was 0.50 microg/L. This method has a simple operation procedure, good separation results, high sensitivity and good repeatability. It can be used as a standard method for the determination of bromate in drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Health and Related Product Safety, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shumin", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Yinling", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xueli", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Se Pu", "NlmUniqueID": "9424804", "ISSNLinking": "1000-8713"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16929854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
