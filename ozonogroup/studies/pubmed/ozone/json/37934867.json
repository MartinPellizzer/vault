Historically, air pollution studies have focused more on cities. However, it is also important to consider the impact on large suburban populations living closer to the major cities. In this study, nitrogen oxides (nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide), sulfur dioxide, ozone, and ammonia concentrations were measured from fifteen sites in the Greater Philadelphia area, Pennsylvania, USA using Ogawa passive samplers from September 2021 to May 2022. The fall season had the highest mean NOx concentrations (11.03\u2009\u00b1\u20094.51 ppb), and spring had the highest mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration (18.65\u2009\u00b1\u20096.71 ppb) compared to other seasons. NOx concentrations were higher at suburban (30.43\u2009\u00b1\u200933.79 ppb) and urban sites (22.49\u2009\u00b1\u200912.54 ppb) compared to semi-rural sites (11.08\u2009\u00b1\u20099.20 ppb). SO<sub>2</sub> was not detected in most of the measurements. The positive statistically significant correlation between NO and NH<sub>3</sub> in urban (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.33, p-value <0.05) and suburban sites (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.37, p-value <0.05) during winter and spring, respectively, suggests a high attribution of traffic emissions to NH<sub>3</sub> at urban and suburban sites. Influence of traffic emissions on air pollutant values for the study region is also supported by similar NOx concentrations between suburban and urban sites as well as decreasing NO<sub>2</sub>/NOx ratios with increased distance from expressways. This study shows that passive sampling can be effectively used for assessing spatial and seasonal variations in air pollutants within an area of diverse land use.<i>Implications</i>: This study presents the findings of temporal and seasonal patterns for nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, tropospheric ozone, and ammonia at urban, suburban, and semi-rural areas of the greater Philadelphia region. The main objective of the study is to monitor air pollution in suburban and semi-rural areas which are not monitored for air pollution. We monitored from a total of fifteen sites in three seasons to assess air pollution in suburban and semi-rural areas near the major city in the United States - Philadelphia. The findings are important to learn how air quality is affected in suburban and semi-rural areas near the major city. The study also shows the useful application of inexpensive passive sampling technique for measuring air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography and the Environment, Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "LastName": "Terry", "ForeName": "Bryan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7035-7019"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography and the Environment, Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "LastName": "Shakya", "ForeName": "Kabindra M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Philadelphia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37934867", "10.1080/10962247.2023.2279733"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
