The influence of iodate and ozone concentration, solution pH, and reaction time on the regeneration efficiency was studied, as well as the reaction kinetics. Regeneration of spent periodate solutions by ozone was successfully performed in alkaline medium, which favors the formation of free (.) OH radicals, as supported by the addition of radical scavengers and quantum mechanical calculations. At pH\u200513 and an ozone concentration of approximately 150\u2005mg\u2009L(-1) , periodate was completely regenerated from a 100\u2005mm solution of iodate within 1\u2005h at room temperature. A cyclic process of cellulose oxidation and subsequent regeneration of spent periodate with 90\u2009% efficiency has been developed. So far, commercial applications of DAC have been hampered by difficulties in reusing the costly periodate. This work overcomes this hurdle and presents a highly efficient, clean, and low-cost protocol for the preparation of DAC with integrated periodate recycling, with the possibility of scaling the process up."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
