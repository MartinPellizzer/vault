Pearson product-moment correlation analysis showed that with the increase of the ozone level in photocopying sites and the PO duration of exposure to ozone, the level of LPO in erythrocytes in the operators was increased (P < 0.001), while the levels of VC, VE and beta-CAR in plasma as well as the activities of SOD and CAT in erythrocytes in the operators were decreased (P < 0.01-0.0001).", "The findings in this study suggest that ozone causes oxidative damage in copier operatives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. hzzjf@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jun F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Gui Z", "Initials": "GZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copying Processes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12653202", "10.1080/1071576021000036623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
