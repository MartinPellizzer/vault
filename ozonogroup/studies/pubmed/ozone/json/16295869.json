Ozone reacts rapidly with the double bond in CBZ, yielding several ozonation products containing quinazoline-based functional groups. The structures for three new oxidation products were elucidated using a combination of mass spectrometric and NMR techniques. The three products were determined to be 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM), 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD), and 1-(2-benzoic acid)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BaQD). Additional kinetic studies of the ozonation products showed very slow subsequent oxidation kinetics with ozone (second-order rate constants, kO3 = approximately 7 M(-1)s(-1) and approximately 1 M(-1)s(-1) at pH = 6 for BQM and BQD, respectively). Rate constants for reactions with OH radicals, kOH, were determined as approximately 7 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1) for BQM and approximately 5 x 10(9)M(-1)s(-1) for BQD. Thus, mainly reactions with OH radicals lead to their further oxidation. A kinetic model including ozone and OH radical reactions allows a prediction of the time-dependent product distribution during ozonation of natural waters. In Rhine River water, CBZ spiked at 500 ng/L was completely oxidized by ozone with applied doses > or =0.3 mg/L. To confirm that the two major ozonation products BQM and BQD are produced as a result of the ozonation of a CBZ-containing natural water, Lake Zurich water samples were spiked with CBZ (1 microM, 236 microg/L). The oxidation products were identified via LC-UV. Concentrations of 0.48 and 0.15 microM for BQM and BQD, respectively, were measured for an ozone dose of 1.9 mg/L. BQM and BQD were also identified in ozonated water from a German waterworks containing CBZ in its raw water with 0.07-0.20 microg/L. Currently, there are no data available on the biological effects of the formed oxidation products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology (BFG), Am Mainzer Tor 1 D-56068 Koblenz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDowell", "ForeName": "Derek C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huber", "ForeName": "Marc M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "Manfred", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ternes", "ForeName": "Thomas A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinazolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33CM23913M", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamazepine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbamazepine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Quinazolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16295869", "10.1021/es050043l"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
