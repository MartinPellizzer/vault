Based on a phenyl-modified silica reversed stationary phase and a methanol-water solvent gradient, it allows the separation of mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) having up to five condensed aromatic rings and partially oxidized derivatives within a single chromatographic run of 40-min duration. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using 81 reference substances (PAHs, phenols, quinones, acids, lactones, esters, etc.) and real samples of environmental, medical, and technical relevance (ozonized PAHs, lake water, human urine, diesel exhaust condensates). The retention times of the investigated aromatics exhibit a regular increase with molecular mass and a systematic decrease with increasing number and polarity of functional groups. In case of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, a positive shift of retention time provides additional structural information. The combination of chromatographic retention time with the molecular mass and structural information from mass spectrometric detection allows the tentative identification of unknown aromatic analytes at trace levels, even without specific reference substances. With atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), low detection limits and highly informative fragmentation patterns can be obtained by in-source collision-induced fragmentation in a single-quadrupole LC-APCI-MS system as applied in this study, and multidimensional MS experiments are expected to further enhance the potential of the presented method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Hydrochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Letzel", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00f6schl", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wissiack", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenberg", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grasserbauer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niessner", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmospheric Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11321321", "10.1021/ac001079t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
