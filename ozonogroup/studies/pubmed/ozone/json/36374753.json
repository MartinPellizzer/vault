We investigated the treatment of a long-chain industrial wastewater treatment train containing Fenton, biological anoxic/oxic (AO), and heterogeneous ozone catalytic oxidation (HOCO) processes, and evaluated their detoxification effect based on the analysis of the genic toxicity of some key contaminants. The results showed that although the effluent met the discharge standard in terms of traditional quality parameters, the long-chain treatment process could not effectively detoxify the industrial wastewater. The analysis results of summer samples showed that the Fenton process increased the total toxicity and genotoxicity of the organics, concerned metals, and non-volatile pollutants, whereas the A/O process increased the toxicity of the organics and non-volatile pollutants, and the HOCO process led to higher toxicity caused by metals and non-volatile pollutants. The outputs of the winter samples indicated that the Fenton process reduced the total toxicity and genotoxicity caused by non-volatile pollutants but increased that of the organics and concerned metals. The effect of the A/O process on the effluent toxicity in winter was the same as that in summer, whereas the HOCO process increased the total toxicity and genotoxicity of the metals in winter samples. Correlation analysis showed that various toxicity stresses were significantly correlated with the variation of these key pollutants in wastewater. Our results could provide a reference for the optimization of industrial wastewater treatment plants (IWTPs) by selecting more suitable treatment procedures to reduce the toxicity of different contaminants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
