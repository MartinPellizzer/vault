The samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to understand the composition, volume fraction, source, \u00b7OH loss rate, and ozone formation potential of the carbonyl compounds. A total of 13 carbonyl compounds containing carbonyl groups were determined, of which acetone, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde were highest at(6.46\u00b15.25)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, (3.76\u00b12.29\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>), and(2.65\u00b11.74)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in Shijiazhuang compared to(1.85\u00b11.27)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, (1.29\u00b11.02)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and(0.72\u00b10.48)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in Xinglong, respectively. The estimated maximum ozone formation potential(OFP) of formaldehyde was much higher than that of acetaldehyde; the C1/C2 and C2/C3 ozone formation potential(OFP) of formaldehyde was much higher than that of acetaldehyde; and the C1/C2 and C2/C3 values showed that vehicle exhaust and fossil fuel combustion were the main sources in Shijiazhuang in association with the higher level of industrialization. In Xinglong, the carbonyl compounds mainly originated from natural sources. Acetaldehyde(1.77 s<sup>-1</sup>), formaldehyde(1.57 s<sup>-1</sup>), and butyraldehyde(0.42 s<sup>-1</sup>) contributed most to <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub> in Shijiazhuang, and formaldehyde(0.53 s<sup>-1</sup>), acetaldehyde(0.47 s<sup>-1</sup>), and butyraldehyde(0.12 s<sup>-1</sup>) were the three main contributors to <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub> in Xinglong. The carbonyl compounds contributing most to O<sub>3</sub> production were formaldehyde and acetaldehyde at(34.61\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> O<sub>3</sub>) and (16.73\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> O<sub>3</sub>) in Shijiazhuang, compared to (11.77\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> O<sub>3</sub>) and (4.47\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> O<sub>3</sub>) in Xinglong, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources, Environment and Tourism, Capital Normal University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Capital Normal University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry(LAPC), Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ying-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry(LAPC), Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zi-Rui", "Initials": "ZR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry(LAPC), Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Gui-Qian", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Capital Normal University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xing-Ru", "Initials": "XR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581102", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202011190"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
