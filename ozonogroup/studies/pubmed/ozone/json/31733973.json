Previous studies suggested potential association between pregnancy air pollution exposure and ASD. This systematic review and meta-analysis is intended to summarize the association between maternal exposure to outdoor air pollution and ASD in children by trimester based on recent studies.", "A systematic literature search in 3 databases (Medline, Embase, and Web of Science) was performed using subject headings related to ASD and air pollution since 2007. Eligible studies were screened and evaluated based on predetermined criteria. For meta-analyses, the studies were grouped by air pollutant and exposure time (prenatal period and trimesters). Within-group studies were standardized by log odds ratio (OR) and then combined by three meta-analysis methods: frequentist fixed and random effects models, and Bayesian random effects model.", "Initial search identified 1564 papers, of which 25 studies remained for final analysis after duplicates and ineligible studies were removed. Of the 25 studies, 13, 14, 12, and 7 studies investigated ASD in children associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and ozone, respectively. The frequentist and Bayesian random effects models resulted in different statistical significance. For prenatal period, frequentist meta-analysis returned significant pooled ORs with 95% confidence intervals, 1.06(1.01,1.11) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 1.02(1.01,1.04) for NO<sub>2</sub>, whereas Bayesian meta-analysis showed similar ORs with wider 95% posterior intervals, 1.06(1.00,1.13) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 1.02(1.00,1.05) for NO<sub>2</sub>. Third trimester appeared to have higher pooled ORs for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and ozone, but patterns in the time-varying associations over the trimester were inconsistent.", "For positive association between maternal exposure to ambient air pollution and ASD in children, there is some evidence for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, weak evidence for NO<sub>2</sub> and little evidence for PM<sub>10</sub> and ozone. However, patterns in associations over trimesters were inconsistent among studies and among air pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
