L.) cvs 'Dare', 'Essex' and 'Williams 82' were inhibited by exposure to 200 nliters liter(-1) ozone (O(3)) for 4 h. Changes in gas exchange rates were not uniform over time, and a near steady state condition was attained after fumigation for 2 h. There was no recovery of Pn or gs for up to 2 h following termination of O(3) application. The cv 'Dare' was considered most sensitive to O(3) since, in this cultivar, gs was least responsive during the initial 2.5 h of fumigation and the estimated internal O(3) flux was about 10% greater than in the other cultivars. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of soybean leaf extracts, followed by activity staining for superoxide dismutase (SOD), revealed the presence of numerous major and minor bands. Cynide sensitivity of several isoforms indicated the presence of both Cu-Zn and Mn SODs. In cv 'Essex', each metalloform accounted for 50% of the total SOD activity. No qualitative differences in SOD banding patterns were evident among the three soybean cultivars before or after O(3) treatment. Ozone fumigation for 4 h did not significantly alter SOD activity in any cultivar. The contribution of gs, as a flux limitation, and SOD activity are discussed as tolerance mechanisms to O(3) in soybean."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology and Weed Science Virginia Technical University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chevone", "ForeName": "B I", "Initials": "BI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hess", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091871", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90008-c", "026974919390008C"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
