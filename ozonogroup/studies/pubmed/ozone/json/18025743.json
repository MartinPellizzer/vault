The study was performed on two identical lab-scale SBRs plant, fed with domestic sewage: a fraction (1/3 of the working volume) of the activated sludge from one reactor (Exp SBR) was periodically subjected to ozonation for 30 minutes at 0.05 g O(3)/gSS and then recirculated before the beginning of the cycle; the other reactor was used as control and therefore managed at the same sludge retention time but without the application of ozonation. The effects of the recirculation of the ozonated sludge to the Exp SBR were evaluated in terms of biological nitrogen and carbon removal efficiencies, Mixed Liquor Volatile and Suspended Solids (MLSS and MLVSS, respectively) concentrations, effluent quality and sludge settleability. Besides, characterization of the ozonated sludge was carried out for different oxidant dosages (0.05, 0.07 and 0.37 g O(3)/gSS) and durations of the ozonation process (10, 20 and 30 minutes). The results show that at 0.05 g O(3)/gSS and 30 minutes contact time MLVSS as well as MLVSS/MLSS ratio do not change appreciably. Ozone dosage must be increased much further to obtain a relevant effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hydraulics, Transportation and Roads, University of Rome La Sapienza, Via Eudossiana 18, 00184, Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiavola", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naso", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rolle", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trombetta", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18025743", "10.2166/wst.2007.709"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
