The wounds were contaminated with microbe dredge consisting of St. aureus, Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli in the concentration of 10(9) cells/ml. After 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours the wound was irrigated with 10-15 ml of the following solutions: in the 1st group - commercial perftorane solution, in the 2nd group - ozonized perftorane, in the 3rd group - physiological solution. Hard medium inoculation let determine total number of growing microbe colonies. The material was taken each 3rd day. 9 experimental series were executed with the total length of experiment equal to 30 days. It was established that from 15th day of the experiment in the group with ozonized perftorane irrigations the mean number of microorganisms in the wound was reduced, granulation tissue growth and epithelization were speeded up if compared with the groups of animals irrigated with physiological solution and non-ozonized perftorane. Ozone action was connected not only with its bactericidal properties but in considerable degree with comprehensive local immunity activation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dmitrieva", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zyrianova", "ForeName": "N V", "Initials": "NV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grigor'ian", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vasilishina", "ForeName": "S Iu", "Initials": "SIu"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Stomatologiia (Mosk)", "NlmUniqueID": "0412072", "ISSNLinking": "0039-1735"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Granulation Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcal Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Suppuration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Infection"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19738573"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
