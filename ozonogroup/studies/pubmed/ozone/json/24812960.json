The effect of pH on ozonation and the removal of COD and UV254 by the ozone-aerated biological filter combined process were investigated. In addition, the variation of relative molecular mass distribution of organics and the characteristics of three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the wastewater were also investigated. The results showed that the suitable operating conditions of the ozonation unit were: ozone dosage 10 mg x L(-1), contact time 4 min and slightly alkaline pH. Ozonation can transfer macromolecular organics into small molecular organics, resulting in a 15% increase in the percentage of the organics with small relative molecular mass (less than 1 000). The biodegradability of the petrochemical secondary effluent was significantly improved by ozonation, making it more suitable for the treatment by aerated biological filter. The removal efficiency of COD and UV254 were 40.8% and 45.8% when the hydraulic retention time was 3 hours and the gas to water ratio was 3:1 for BAF. The average COD of the petrochemical wastewater was 86.5 mg x L(-1) while the average COD of the effluent of the combined process was 49.4 mg x L(-1) when it was operated under optimal conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming-Guo", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chang-Yong", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yue-Xi", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Pei-Chao", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "De", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Extraction and Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24812960"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
