The purpose of this study was to quantify the relationship between emissions of NH<sub>3</sub>, NOx, SO<sub>2</sub>, VOCs and SIA concentrations during a severe winter haze episode using an air quality model and a meteorology-based redistributed NH<sub>3</sub> emission inventory within the BTH region. The results showed that the model performance regarding the NH<sub>3</sub> simulations in January by the four emission inventories improved after the redistribution of daily NH<sub>3</sub> emissions, with an increase of 0.02-0.13 in R, a 9-56% decrease in NMB, and a 7-51% decrease in NME. The updated simulations reproduced the daily observations of SIA, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> well. A total of 125 sets of sensitivity simulations showed that a synergistic reduction in NH<sub>3</sub> and VOCs was more efficient in terms of SIA control than simply reducing SO<sub>2</sub> or NOx in the BTH region. If only NOx emissions were reduced, the SIA concentration would first increase and then decrease, and it could decline by another 0.86-8.03% in parallel with an equal NH<sub>3</sub> emission cut. SIA could be reduced by approximately 22.68% with the most stringent inorganic precursors' control. Moreover, VOCs emission reductions could lead to a decrease in SIA, and the impact of VOCs on SIA was similar to that of NH<sub>3</sub>. The collaborative control of both inorganic precursors and VOCs was more effective than single-factor control measures for decreasing SIA, and the decline rate was approximately 29.26% under minimum emission conditions. This improved effectiveness was obtained because VOCs mitigation effectively decreases the ozone concentration, which in turn influences SIA formation. Finally, on the premise of a 60% SO<sub>2</sub> cut, the reduction scheme NH<sub>3</sub>:VOCs:NOx = 4:4:1 was suggested for SIA control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
