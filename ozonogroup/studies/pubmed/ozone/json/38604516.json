A low-pressure mercury UV (LP-UV) lamp was used and degradation by UV (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0254\u00a0nm) followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Incident radiation in the reactor was measured via chemical actinometry using uridine. The quantum yields (\u03c6) for the degradation of CAP, BIC and IRI were 0.012, 0.0020 and 0.0045\u00a0mol\u00a0Einstein<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Ozone experiments with CAP and IRI were conducted by adding ozone stock solution to the reactor either with or without addition of tert-butanol (t-BuOH) as radical quencher. Using this experimental arrangement, no degradation of BIC was observed, so a semi-batch setup was employed for the ozone degradation experiments of BIC. Without t-BuOH, apparent second order reaction rate constants for the reaction of the ADs with molecular ozone were determined to be 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 \u2219 10<sup>3</sup>\u00a0L\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (CAP), 7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 \u2219 10<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0L\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (BIC) and 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 \u2219 10<sup>3</sup>\u00a0L\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (IRI). When OH-radicals (\u2219OH) were quenched, rate constants were virtually the same for CAP and IRI. For BIC, a significantly lower constant of 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 \u2219 10<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0L\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> was determined. Of the tested substances, BIC was the most recalcitrant, with the slowest degradation during both ozonation and UV-irradiation. The extent of mineralization was also determined for both processes. UV irradiation was able to fully degrade up to 80% of DOC, ozonation up to 30%. Toxicity tests with Daphnia magna (D. magna) did not find toxicity for fully degraded solutions of the three ADs at environmentally relevant concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
