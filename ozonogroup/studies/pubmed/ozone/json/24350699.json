In this paper, the products of AFB1 were investigated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC Q-TOF MS). The products were well separated using UPLC, and the accurate masses of all the products were determined using Q-TOF MS. Finally, the possible pathways of fragmentation ion generation from the products of AFB1 and the structures of four products were proposed. From the view of the proposed structures of products, the C8-C9 double bond in the terminal furan ring was destroyed. According to the structure-activity relationship, the toxicity of products was significantly reduced compared with that of AFB1. The result indicated that ozone was an effective agent for degrading AFB1, and UPLC Q-TOF MS was a useful analytical tool for proposing and identifying a series of unknown products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, National Engineering Laboratory for Cereal Fermentation Technology, School of Food Science and Technology , Jiangnan University , Wuxi , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Xiaohu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ren", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yongfu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Ruihang", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiulan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhengxing", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Guanjun", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24350699", "10.1080/19440049.2013.853323"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
