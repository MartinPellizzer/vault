To confirm whether supplementation with vitamins C and E could reduce lung function decrements, airway inflammation, and epithelial injury in subjects sensitive to ozone, a double-blinded, crossover control study was performed. Fourteen ozone-responsive subjects were randomly exposed to both air and ozone (0.2 ppm for 2 h) after 7 days of either placebo treatment or supplementation with vitamin C (500 mg/day) and E (100 mg/day). Lung function was assessed pre- and immediately postexposure and blood samples were taken at set intervals. Inflammatory, tissue injury, and antioxidant responses were examined in lavage fluid obtained by bronchoscopy 6 h postexposure. Exposure to ozone resulted in significant (P < 0.01) decrements in FEV1 with no protection observed following vitamin supplementation (-8.5%) versus placebo (-7.3%) treatment. Similarly, ozone-induced neutrophilia were of a similar magnitude after both treatments (P < 0.05). This lack of protection was observed despite elevated plasma vitamin C (+60.1%) and vitamin E (+51.4%) concentrations following supplementation, and increased vitamin C concentrations in the airways after supplementation following ozone exposure. These data do not therefore support the contention that acute ozone-induced symptoms can be attenuated through the use of dietary antioxidants in well-nourished individuals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lung Biology, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Division, Franklin-Wilkins Building, Kings' College London, London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mudway", "ForeName": "Ian S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Behndig", "ForeName": "Annelie F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Helleday", "ForeName": "Ragnberth", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pourazar", "ForeName": "Jamshid", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frew", "ForeName": "Anthony J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "Frank J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blomberg", "ForeName": "Anders", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8709159", "ISSNLinking": "0891-5849"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Free Radic Biol Med. 2006 May 15;40(10):1693-7. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.02.021", "PMID": "16678007"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16767844", "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.10.050", "S0891-5849(05)00660-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
