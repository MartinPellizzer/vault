The yCe20Mn/ZSM-5-81 catalyst with 8% Ce loading showed the highest catalytic activity at relative humidity of 50% and a space velocity of 360\u00a0L/(g\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0hr), giving 93% conversion of 600\u00a0ppm O<sub>3</sub> after 5 hr. Moreover, this sample still maintained highly activity and stability in humid air with 50%-70% relative humidity. Series of physicochemical characterization including X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed technology (NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD and H<sub>2</sub>-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and oxygen isotopic exchange were introduced to disclose the structure-performance relationship. The results indicated that moderate Si/Al ratio (81) of zeolite support was beneficial for ozone decomposition owing to the synergies of acidity and hydrophobicity. Furthermore, compared with 20Mn/ZSM-5-81, Ce doping could enhance the amount of low valance manganese (such as Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup>). Besides, the Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> ratio of 8Ce20Mn/ZSM-5-81 sample was higher than that of 4Ce20Mn/ZSM-5-81. Additionally, the synergy between the MnO<sub>x</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub> could easily transfer electron via the redox cycle, thus resulting in an increased reducibility at low temperatures and high concentration of surface oxygen. This study provides important insights to the utilization of porous zeolite with high surface area to disperse active component of manganese for ozone decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
