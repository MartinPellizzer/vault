However, the high variability of the switching behavior, which results from the high electroforming voltage, external environmental conditions, and transition to the non-volatile switching mode in a high-current range, is considered a major impediment to such applications. Herein, for the first time, we developed a highly reliable threshold switching device immune to atmospheric changes based on an ultraviolet-ozone (UVO)-treated diffusive memristor consisting of Ag and SiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods (NRs). UVO treatment forms a stable water reservoir on the surface of SiO<sub>2</sub> NRs, facilitating the redox reaction and ion migration of Ag. Consequently, diffusive memristors possess reliable switching characteristics, including electroforming-free, repeatable, and consistent switching with resistance to changes in ambient conditions and compliance levels during operation. We demonstrated that our approach is suitable for various metal oxides and can be used in numerous applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul02791, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Young Geun", "Initials": "YG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul02791, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul02841, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ji Eun", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul02791, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul02841, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Jae Uk", "Initials": "JU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul02791, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul02841, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Chun", "ForeName": "Suk Yeop", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul02791, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul02841, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Soh", "ForeName": "Keunho", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2192-5320"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul02841, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul02841, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Nahm", "ForeName": "Sahn", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4516-8160"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul02791, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul02841, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chong-Yun", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2239-3680"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electronic Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul02791, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Jung Ho", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36691225", "10.1021/acsami.2c21019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
