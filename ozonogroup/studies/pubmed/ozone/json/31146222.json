For the function (f<sub>VPD</sub>) describing the limitation of stomatal conductance by vapor pressure deficit (VPD, kPa), cumulative VPD during daylight hours was superior to hourly VPD. The latter function is proposed as a methodological improvement of this multiplicative model when stomatal conductance peaks during the morning and it is reduced later as it is the case of maize in this experiment. The model agreed relatively well with the measured stomatal conductance (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.63). Based on the comparison of R<sup>2</sup> values of the response functions, POD<sub>6</sub> (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose over an hourly threshold 6\u202fnmol\u202fm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and AOT40 (accumulated hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over a threshold of 40\u202fppb) performed similarly. The critical levels based on POD<sub>6</sub> and AOT40 for 5% reduction in maize yield were 1.17\u202fmmol\u202fm<sup>-2</sup> PLA and 8.70\u202fppm\u202fh, respectively. In comparison with other important crops, the ranking of sensitivity of maize strongly differed depending on the O<sub>3</sub> metric used, AOT40 or POD<sub>6</sub>. The newly proposed response functions are relevant for O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment for this crop in Asia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
