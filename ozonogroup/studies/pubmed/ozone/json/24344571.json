Traffic emission data for both compounds are scarce and mostly outdated. A better knowledge of today's HCHO and HONO emissions related to traffic is needed to refine air quality models. Here the authors report results from continuous ambient air measurements taken at a highway junction in Houston, Texas, from July 15 to October 15, 2009. The observational data were compared with emission estimates from currently available mobile emission models (MOBILE6; MOVES [MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator]). Observations indicated a molar carbon monoxide (CO) versus nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) ratio of 6.01 +/- 0.15 (r2 = 0.91), which is in agreement with other field studies. Both MOBILE6 and MOVES overestimate this emission ratio by 92% and 24%, respectively. For HCHO/CO, an overall slope of 3.14 +/- 0.14 g HCHO/kg CO was observed. Whereas MOBILE6 largely underestimates this ratio by 77%, MOVES calculates somewhat higher HCHO/CO ratios (1.87) than MOBILE6, but is still significantly lower than the observed ratio. MOVES shows high HCHO/CO ratios during the early morning hours due to heavy-duty diesel off-network emissions. The differences of the modeled CO/NO(x) and HCHO/CO ratios are largely due to higher NO(x) and HCHO emissions in MOVES (30% and 57%, respectively, increased from MOBILE6 for 2009), as CO emissions were about the same in both models. The observed HONO/NO(x) emission ratio is around 0.017 +/- 0.0009 kg HONO/kg NO(x) which is twice as high as in MOVES. The observed NO2/NO(x) emission ratio is around 0.16 +/- 0.01 kg NO2/kg NO(x), which is a bit more than 50% higher than in MOVES. MOVES overestimates the CO/CO2 emission ratio by a factor of 3 compared with the observations, which is 0.0033 +/- 0.0002 kg CO/kg CO2. This as well as CO/NO(x) overestimation is coming from light-duty gasoline vehicles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA. brappenglueck@uh.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rappengl\u00fcck", "ForeName": "Bernhard", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Houston-Galveston Area Council, Houston, TX, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lubertino", "ForeName": "Graciela", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "Sergio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Golovko", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Czader", "ForeName": "Beata", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ackermann", "ForeName": "Luis", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24344571", "10.1080/10962247.2013.822438"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
