Previous studies demonstrated that adult rat offspring (approximately 6-months-old) from dams given a high-fat diet (HFD) prior to, during, and after pregnancy displayed elevated pulmonary responses to an acute ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of maternal and perinatal HFD on pulmonary and metabolic responses to O<sub>3</sub> in male and female young-adult offspring (approximately 3-month old). One-month-old F0 female Long-Evans rats commenced HFD (60% kcal from fat) or control diet (CD; 10.5% kcal from fat) and were bred on PND 72. Offspring were maintained on respective HFD or CD until PND 29 when all groups were switched to CD. The 3-months-old female and male offspring (n\u00a0=\u00a010/group) were exposed to air or 0.8 ppm O<sub>3</sub> for 5hr/day for 2 consecutive days. Maternal and perinatal HFD significantly increased body weight and body fat % in offspring regardless of gender. Ozone exposure, but not maternal and perinatal diet, induced hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in the offspring. Ozone-induced alterations in pulmonary function were exacerbated by maternal and perinatal HFD in both offspring genders. Pulmonary injury/inflammation markers in response to O<sub>3</sub> exposure such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total cells, and neutrophils were further augmented in offspring (males>females) from dams fed the HFD. Data suggest that maternal and perinatal HFD may enhance the susceptibility of offspring to O<sub>3</sub>-induced pulmonary injury and that these effects may be sex-specific."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division , US Environmental Protection Agency , Durham , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Snow", "ForeName": "Samantha J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Toxicity Assessment Division , US Environmental Protection Agency , Durham , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Pamela M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division , US Environmental Protection Agency , Durham , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ledbetter", "ForeName": "Allen", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Toxicity Assessment Division , US Environmental Protection Agency , Durham , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnstone", "ForeName": "Andrew F M", "Initials": "AFM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division , US Environmental Protection Agency , Durham , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schladweiler", "ForeName": "Mette C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Toxicity Assessment Division , US Environmental Protection Agency , Durham , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division , US Environmental Protection Agency , Durham , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "Urmila P", "Initials": "UP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Long-Evans"}], "CoiStatement": "Disclosures.
