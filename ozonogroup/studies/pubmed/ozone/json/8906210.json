This study investigated the adhesive behavior of the alveolar macrophages and its relevance to the inflammatory processes in the lung. Macrophages recovered by BAL from rats exposed to purified air or 0.8 ppm O3 were studied in vitro for their adhesion to epithelial cells derived from ARL-14. The macrophages from O3-exposed animals displayed greater adhesion to the epithelial cells than the macrophages from control rats exposed to purified air. The O3-induced adhesion was attenuated in the macrophages treated with a combination of interleukin-1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies (anti-IL-1+anti-TNF). The cell adhesion stimulated by O3 exposure was also attenuated when the macrophages were incubated in the presence of antibodies to leukocyte adhesion molecules, CD11b, or epithelial cell adhesion molecules, ICAM-1. A marginal increase in the surface expression of CD11b was noticed in macrophages from the rats exposed to O3. A similar change in the ICAM-1 expression was, however, not observed. The results suggest that the O3-induced modifications of macrophages are mediated by IL-1 and TNF, and that these modifications are accompanied by a minimal change in the expression of the cell-adhesion molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhalla", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoffman", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pearson", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "5T32 ES07157", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES03521", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann N Y Acad Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7506858", "ISSNLinking": "0077-8923"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azepines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macrophage-1 Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1F3X9DRV9X", "NameOfSubstance": "laurocapram"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Azepines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophage-1 Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8906210", "10.1111/j.1749-6632.1996.tb32565.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
