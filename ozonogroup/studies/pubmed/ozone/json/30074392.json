The nature of the substituents (R,R' = H, CH<sub>3</sub>, CH\u2550CH<sub>2</sub>) and conformations of the Criegee intermediates control their subsequent chemistry in the atmosphere. In particular, unimolecular decay of MVK-OO is predicted to be the major source of hydroxyl radicals (OH) in isoprene ozonolysis. This study reports the initial laboratory synthesis and direct detection of MVK-OO through reaction of a photolytically generated, resonance-stabilized monoiodoalkene radical with O<sub>2</sub>. MVK-OO is characterized utilizing infrared (IR) action spectroscopy, in which IR activation of MVK-OO with two quanta of CH stretch at ca. 6000 cm<sup>-1</sup> is coupled with ultraviolet detection of the resultant OH products. MVK-OO is identified by comparison of the experimentally observed IR spectral features with theoretically predicted IR absorption spectra. For syn-MVK-OO, the rate of appearance of OH products agrees with the unimolecular decay rate predicted using statistical theory with tunneling. This validates the hydrogen atom transfer mechanism and computed transition-state barrier (18.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) leading to OH products. Theoretical calculations reveal an additional roaming pathway between the separating radical fragments, which results in other products. Master equation modeling yields a thermal unimolecular decay rate for syn-MVK-OO of 33 s<sup>-1</sup> (298 K, 1 atm). For anti-MVK-OO, theoretical exploration of several unimolecular decay pathways predicts that isomerization to dioxole is the most likely initial step to products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barber", "ForeName": "Victoria P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pandit", "ForeName": "Shubhrangshu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Amy M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trongsiriwat", "ForeName": "Nisalak", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8392-4150"], "LastName": "Walsh", "ForeName": "Patrick J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division , Argonne National Laboratory , Argonne , Illinois 60439 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6297-9187"], "LastName": "Klippenstein", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6323 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2367-3497"], "LastName": "Lester", "ForeName": "Marsha I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30074392", "10.1021/jacs.8b06010"]}}]}
