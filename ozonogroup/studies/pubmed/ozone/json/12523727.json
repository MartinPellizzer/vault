HS were extracted from the Han River and the samples obtained were analyzed before/after oxidation with the following analytical methods: DOC, THMFP, UV-abs, chemical composition, molecular weight distribution, IR. Ozonation experiments were conducted in batch-type reactors. Ozone dose was 1 mg/L and contact time was varied from 0 to 20 minutes. The fraction of hydrophobic matter was 56.0% of total organic carbon in the Han River and the ratio of humic/fulvic acids was 22.4/77.6, showing high fractions of aromatic and/or double carbon bond functional groups and high fractions of saturated aliphatic carbons. Oxygen fraction of Han HS was relatively high compared with other humic substances (Suwannee River humic and fulvic acids), which are consistent with the results of IR spectra. The IR spectra showed the increase in aliphatic groups by ozonation of the Han HS. Humic substances could not completely be oxidized to CO2, H2O etc., but were partly oxidized to low molecular weight matter (aliphatics, aldehydes, carboxylics, polysaccharides etc.), so low removal efficiencies in terms of DOC (31-35% with 5 minute contact) were observed. For UV254, 5 minute or shorter contact showed more than 80% removal efficiencies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, University of Seoul, 90 Junnondong, Dongdamungu, Seoul, 130-743, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XII14C5FXV", "NameOfSubstance": "fulvic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12523727"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
