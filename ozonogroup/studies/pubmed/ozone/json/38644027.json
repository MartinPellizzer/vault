In Mexico, the total lockdown period took place during the dry-hot season when biomass burning activity is enhanced. Here, we investigate the role of biomass burning emissions on regional ozone levels in the Megalopolis of Central Mexico. The studied period covers the lockdown phases 2 and 3, and the first month of the New Normal. We applied a factor separation technique and process analysis to estimate the pure and synergistic contributions of emission reductions under lockdown and that from biomass burning to daily ozone maximum concentrations in 7 metropolitan areas of different states in the Megalopolis. The results revealed that biomass burning plumes likely masked the effect of massive reductions from mobile emissions, impacted the PBL development during phase 3 and favored transition and mixed NO<sub>x</sub>-limited and VOC-limited regional regimes. This contributed to increased ozone production in the middle to lower PBL by changing the regional background levels which potentially could bias high ozone production efficiency estimations. Given the Megalopolis contribution to economic and societal development at national scale, our study suggests that ozone mitigation measures during the dry-hot season targeting mainly mobile emissions will likely be offset by biomass burning plumes. A regional and synergic policy aiming to control biomass burning would help to reduce the occurrence of high ozone levels in Central Mexico with the co-benefit of tackling short-lived climate pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
