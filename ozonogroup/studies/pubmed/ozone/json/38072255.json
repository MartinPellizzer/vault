Owing to the photocatalytic properties, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs' toxicity may be aggravated by enhanced UV-B resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion. However, the molecular mechanisms of phytoplankton in response to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs under UV-B remains poorly understood. In this study, we integrated whole transcriptome analysis with physiological data to provide understanding on the toxic and protective mechanisms of marine Chlorella pyrenoidosa in response to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs under UV-B. The results indicated that the changes in gene expression could be related to the growth inhibition and TiO<sub>2</sub> NP internalization in C. pyrenoidosa, and several molecular mechanisms were identified as toxicity response to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs and UV-B. Differential expression of genes involved in glycerophospholipids metabolism indicated that cell membrane disruption allowed TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs to enter the algal cell under UV-B exposure, although the up-regulation of genes involved in the general secretory dependent pathway and the ATP-binding cassette transporter family drove cellular secretion of extracellular polymeric substances, acting as a barrier that prevent TiO<sub>2</sub> NP internalization. The absence of changes in gene expression related to the antioxidant system may be responsible for the severe oxidative stress observed in algal cells following exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs under UV-B irradiation. Moreover, differential expression of genes involved in pathways such as photosynthesis and energy metabolism were up-regulated, including the light-harvesting, photosynthetic electron transport coupled to photophosphorylation, carbon fixation, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that more energy and metabolites were supplied to cope with the toxicity of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs and UV-B. The obtained results provide valuable information on the molecular mechanisms of response of marine phytoplankton exposed to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs and UV-B."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
