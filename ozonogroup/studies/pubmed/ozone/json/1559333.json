Ramses 19 nonlubricated latex condoms and one other available by retail purchase within 6 months of manufacture were uses. Stretching was accomplished over a circular graphite electron microscope holder and fixed in place with adhesive. Surfaces were washed with running distilled deionized water for 5 minutes in order to remove dusting powder, and air dried. Then condoms were sputter coated with a 20 nm thick layer of gold palladium to increase conductivity. An Amray 1400 SEM operating at 10 keV was used to examine the condoms and images were recorded on Polaroid 52 black and while film. Condoms from the same lots were filled with 1% (w/v) toluidine blue and inserted in a container of 230 ml distilled deionized water for an hour. Then the condom was assayed spectrophotometrically at 640 nm for the presence of the blue. The results indicated rippling and tears following colinearly the direction of the stretch, and did not appear to be related to age of the condom. Unstretched latex appeared under low magnification different from stretched in that there were puckers and dimples but no holes. Stretched latex showed acordianlike ripples in the direction of the stretch and characterized the entire stretched surface. Tears were formed perpendicular to ripples to a length of 48 +or- 12 um se (n=10) in a straight line. It could not be determined whether the tear extended through the full thickness. The dye experiment was used to assess the tears. It was found that a small molecule like tuluidine blue with a molecular weight of 306 daltons was contained. Important considerations of these results were twofold. 1) A rippled latex surface may provide greater depth penetration of ozone, which increases the rate of deterioration during extended condom use. 2) Since the thickness of condoms tested was .065 mm out of the possibilities o .04, .065, and .1 mm thickness, condoms may be strengthened by increasing the thickness. Lower rates of condoms breakage are reported with thicker condoms. Questions are also raised about whether quality control measurements should be performed; i.e., air burst, tensile strength testing."]}], "OtherID": ["071464", "00209950"], "PMID": "1559333", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "05", "Day": "12"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "24"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0010-7824", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "45", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "Feb"}}, "Title": "Contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contraception"}, "ArticleTitle": "Altered surface character of stretched condom latex.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "105", "EndPage": "110", "MedlinePgn": "105-10"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["A new type of imperfection in condom latex, present during moderate stretching, was observed by low magnification scanning electron microscopy. The normally smooth surface of relaxed natural latex was transformed into an accordion-like arrangement of ripples in addition to tears. A corollary experiment with Alcian blue dye placed into both stretched and unstretched condoms leaked no dye. These surface features are consistent with latex acting as a molecular barrier. The tears may represent areas of lowered mechanical resistance and raise questions concerning quality control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Massachusetts, Worcester 01655."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jay", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drummond", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lane", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Contraception", "NlmUniqueID": "0234361", "ISSNLinking": "0010-7824"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Devices, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1559333", "10.1016/0010-7824(92)90044-t", "0010-7824(92)90044-T"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
