The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate and the ratio of 5-day biological oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand (BOD5/COD) in the O3/Fenton process were approximately 17% and 26%, respectively, higher than those in the O3\u00a0+\u00a0Fenton process with an initial pH of 3. The COD removal rate of the amoxicillin solution reached maximum at the Fe(II) concentration of 0.6\u00a0mM, temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C, rotation speed of 800\u00a0rpm and initial pH of 3. The BOD5/COD of the amoxicillin solution increased from 0 to 0.38 after the solution was treated by the O3/Fenton process. Analysis of the intermediates indicated that the pathway of amoxicillin degradation in the O3/Fenton process was similar to that in the O3\u00a0+\u00a0Fenton process. Contrast experiment results showed that amoxicillin degradation was significantly intensified in the RPB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
