The currently employed systems are numerous and fall in the following large categories; thermal processes, evaporation, membrance processes, anaerobic digestion, anaerobic co-digestion, biodiesel spraying, combustion, transesterification, coagulation, and composting. Respective methodologies in conjunction with waste treatment methods were presented per waste treatment method. The comparative presentation of the various vegetable waste treatment methodologies showed that though anaerobic digestion stands for the most enviromentally friendly technique, its required longer treatment time in conjuction with its weakness to deal with elemental contaminants makes imperative the employment of a second alternative technique which could either be a membrance process (low energy cost, reliability, reduced capital cost) or a coagulation/flocculation method because of its low cost and high effectiveness. Biogas production appears to be another promising and energy effective waste treatment method. On the other hand, methods like distillation and ozonation (high cost) and electrolysis (experimental level) have not been employed in the field. Finally, new waste management technologies have been described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture Icthyology & Aquatic Environment, School of Agricultural Sciences, University of Thessaly, Volos, Hellas, Greece. parmenion@uth.gr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arvanitoyannis", "ForeName": "Ioannis S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varzakas", "ForeName": "Theodoros H", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Anaerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}], "NumberOfReferences": "155"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18274973", "10.1080/10408390701279798", "790618227"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
