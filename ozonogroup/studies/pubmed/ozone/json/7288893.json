Eight randomly selected rats were exposed for 4 h. Four rats were exposed to a clean air (sham) atmosphere, and four to an atmosphere containing 1ppm O3. PAM were obtained by lung lavage and placed on gold-colloid coated coverslips. The area cleared of gold particles by migrating PAM after 24, 48, and 72 h was used as an indicator of cell mobility. The number of PAM recoverable by lavage was similar for both groups (2 x 10(5)), but the percentage of macrophages that made tracks was significantly smaller with 95% certainty in the O3 group. For sham-exposed and O3-exposed groups, the area cleared by PAM increased as the length of incubation increased, with the area cleared by the sham-exposed group being about 50% greater during each time period. When the two groups were compared statistically at each time point, the probability that they differed was, in each case, greater than 95%. It was concluded that the in vitro migrational potential of PAM was most likely decreased by in vivo exposure to O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McAllen", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phalen", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rasmussen", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES 01835", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7288893", "10.1080/15287398109529988"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
