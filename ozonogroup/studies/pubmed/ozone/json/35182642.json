The results demonstrated that NDMA generated directly from DMAPA during ozonation. Moreover, the NDMA yields increased with ozone dosages. The NDMA molar yield increased and then decreased when the pH raised from 5 to 9, achieving the maximum value at pH 8. Hydroxyl radical (\u2219OH) played a promotional role in NDMA formation, and its scavenger dramatically cut down its yields. Low levels of Br<sup>-</sup> facilitated NDMA formation, while the value significantly reduced when Br<sup>-</sup> was up to 1 mM. The NDMA amount was slightly raised by NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, but it was inhibited by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Moreover, it was also depressed by co-existing components in actual lake water. Based on the result of the Gaussian calculation, the LC-MS/MS and GC-MS analysis, four possible transformation pathways were proposed. The radical recombination was verified to be the primary pathway for ozone promoting NDMA formation from DMAPA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
