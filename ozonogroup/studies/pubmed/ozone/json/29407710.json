To ensure safe and robust treatment, it is vital to define the ozone demand and ozone kinetics of the specific water matrix to avoid ozone overdose. Different ozone dosages were applied to water in freshwater recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Experiments were performed to investigate ozone kinetics and demand, and to evaluate the effects on the water quality, particularly in relation to fluorescent organic matter. This study aimed at predicting a suitable ozone dosage for water treatment based on daily ozone demand via laboratory studies. These ozone dosages will be eventually applied and maintained at these levels in pilot-scale RAS to verify predictions. Selected water quality parameters were measured, including natural fluorescence and organic compound concentration changes during ozonation. Ozone reactions were described by first order kinetics. Organic matter, assessed as chemical oxygen demand and fluorescence, decreased by 25% (low O<sub>3</sub>), 30% (middle O<sub>3</sub>) and 53% (high O<sub>3</sub>), while water transmittance improved by 15% over an 8-day period. No fish mortality was observed. Overall, this study confirms that ozone can improve RAS water quality, provides a better understanding of the ozone decay mechanisms that can be used to define further safe ozone treatment margins, and that fluorescence could be used as a monitoring tool to control ozone. This study might be used as a tool to design ozone systems for full-scale RAS by analysing water sample from the specific RAS in the laboratory."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
