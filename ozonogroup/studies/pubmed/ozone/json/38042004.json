For energy saving and emission reduction goals, the simultaneous decomplexation and recovery of metal resources is the ideal disposal of wastewater with heavy metal complexes. Herein, a self-catalytic decomplexation scheme is developed via an electrochemical ozone production (EOP) system to achieve efficient decomplexation and Cu recovery. The EOP system could achieve 94.36% decomplexation of Cu-TEPA, which is a typical complex in catalyst industrial wastewater, and 86.52% recovery of Cu within 60\u00a0min at a current density of 10\u00a0mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. The O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH generated at the anode would first attack Cu-TEPA to produce Cu-organic nitrogen intermediates, which further catalyze O<sub>3</sub> to generate <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, thus self-enhancing the decomposition process in the EOP system. The released Cu<sup>2+</sup> was gradually reduced to Cu<sup>+</sup> and finally deposited as Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu to the stainless steel cathode. The technological feasibility was confirmed with other Cu-complexes such as Cu-EDTA and Cu-citrate, and the actual Cu-TEPA-containing industrial wastewater. The results provide new insights regarding the application of EOP in the simultaneous treatment of heavy metal complex wastewater and resource recovery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
