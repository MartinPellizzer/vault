Different microorganisms of importance to the food industry were inoculated onto stainless steel squares and incubated at various temperatures and relative humidities for up to 4 h. Survival of microorganisms from these controls was compared with identically incubated squares exposed to ozone. Exposure of the contaminated surfaces to ozone (2 ppm for 4 h) resulted in a reduction in microbial viability that ranged, depending on organism type, from 7.56 to 2.41 log values. For all the microorganisms tested, this loss in viability was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that observed in the absence of ozone. Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to ozone than gram-positive organisms; bacteria were more sensitive than the yeast strain tested. Exposure to ozone (2 ppm for 4 h) in the presence of ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk resulted in a reduction in bacterial viability that ranged from 5.64 to 1.65 log values. In most cases, this reduction was significantly less (P < 0.05) than that achieved in the absence of organic material, although still significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that observed in the absence of ozone. The presence of a meat-based broth reduced the effectiveness of ozone to a greater extent, although the number of surviving gram-negative organisms was still significantly less (P < 0.05) than in the absence of ozone. Less than 1 log unit of yeast cells was destroyed when exposed to ozone in the presence of UHT milk or meat-based broth. Results of this investigation suggest that if applied after adequate cleaning ozone could be used as an effective disinfectant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC), Food Safety Research Group, School of Applied Sciences, UK. gmoore@uwic.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Griffith", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peters", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "12597-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Stainless Steel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stainless Steel"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10945587", "10.4315/0362-028x-63.8.1100", "S0362-028X(22)00610-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
