In this study, the determination of OH-radical and ozone exposure from second order rate kinetics with two internal tracer substances was evaluated as alternative approach for these waters. Results from batch and semi-batch experiments showed a linear correlation of OH-radical exposure with ozone consumption, characterized by its slope indicating the formation efficiency of OH-radicals and a lag ozone consumption without significant formation of OH-radicals. Evaluation of data from the project PILOTOX on ozonation of secondary effluent confirmed reasonable prediction of ozone resistant compound removal from relative residual concentration of an internal tracer substance. In contrast, predicting the reduction of TrOCs by direct reactions with ozone from internal tracers was not feasible. Similar removal efficiencies for fast reacting compounds with different rate constants from k(O3) = 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) to k(O3) = 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) were observed indicating a limitation of the reaction by mass transfer. This effect was observed at low ozone dosages in semi-batch and pilot experiments as well as in batch experiments, where mass transfer from gas to liquid phase is not limiting. It is assumed that consumption of low ozone dosages is faster than sample homogenization in the batch reactors used. Thus, prediction of compound removal by direct reaction with ozone always needs to consider reactor design and geometry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
