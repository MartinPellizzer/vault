Theoretical calculations were performed for the title reaction using CVT/SCT in combination with CCSD(T)/6-31+G (d,p)//MP2/6-311+G(2df,2p) level of theory, to complement our experimental measurements. The test molecule would survive for 1 h in the atmosphere, and therefore, it can be considered as a very short-lived compound. 1,3-Butadience cannot contribute to global warming as it is very short-lived. However, 4 ppm of ozone is estimated to be formed by the test molecule, which can be considered to be reasonably significant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras , Chennai 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Vijayakumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3344-5159"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras , Chennai 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Rajakumar", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28186753", "10.1021/acs.jpca.6b12227"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
