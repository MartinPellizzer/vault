Air samples were collected in an undisturbed setting on weekend days and in an occupied setting during teaching hours. In the first week PATUs were turned off and in the second week they were turned on. On weekend days PATUs reduced indoor levels of PM-10 by 87% in February and by 70% in June compared to weekend days when PATUs were turned off. On schooldays, indoor PM-10 was increased by 6% in February and reduced by 42% in June. For PM-2.5 reductions on weekend days were 89% in February and 80% in June. On school days PM-2.5 was increased by 15% in February and reduced by 83% in June. Turning on the PATUs reduced total VOC by 80% on weekend days and by 57% on school days (but not in June). No influence on formaldehyde, NO(2), O(3) and molds was observed. PATUs appeared to be less effective in removal of air pollutants when used in an occupied classroom compared to an unoccupied setting. Our study suggests that such devices should be tested in real-life settings to evaluate their influence on indoor air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory Molecular Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and HTA, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. p.scheepers@ebh.umcn.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scheepers", "ForeName": "Paul T J", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cremers", "ForeName": "Robbert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Hout", "ForeName": "Stef P R", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anzion", "ForeName": "Rob B M", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schools"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22027817", "10.1039/c1em10559k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
