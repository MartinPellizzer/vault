Little attention has focused on the factors that increase the release of lead pigment granules from painted surfaces. Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) from transportation emissions in urban environments have the potential to react with and remove polymeric binders in paint, making pigment granules more available for subsequent transfer to hands on contact, or deposition in housedust. Here we show that exposure to NO(2) and O(3) increased the lead in wipe samples of stainless steel surfaces painted with alkyd low gloss solvent lead-based paint by 296% +/- 101 (or 0.24 microg/cm(2)) and 37% +/- 21 (or 0.025 microg/cm(2)), respectively, with corresponding changes in surface morphology indicated by reflectometry and scanning electron microscopy. Lead release from unexposed low gloss acrylic household paints was 40 times greater than comparable solvent based paints. Given that lead-based paint is still manufactured and used in many urban areas of the developing world where O(3) concentrations currently exceed historic U.S. concentrations, the interaction of air pollution with lead painted indoor surfaces may pose greater exposure risks for lead poisoning in children than previously anticipated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, USA. edwardsr@uci.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "N L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleinman", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Lead Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Paint"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20028045", "10.1021/es901077m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
