Through analysis of the ozone generating potential, this paper preliminarily evaluated its harm to the environment. The results showed that although the concentration of VOCs was low, it contained benzene and formaldehyde, and the highest detection concentration could reach 1.53 mg x m(-3) and 15.4 mg x m(-3), which might cause serious environmental and human health hazards, Moreover, the VOCs emission from heat-setting machines in Zhejiang province was between 200. 9 t x a(-1) and 2 239.3 t x a(-1), which was dominated by formaldehyde, accounting for about 50%. The O3 yield generated from VOCs was between 860.4 t and 16 715. 5 t, with the average of 7 729.6 t. The main contribution of VOCs was xylene, toluene and formaldehyde, which could account for more than 90%. Furthermore, the VOCs emission from heat-setting machines in Shaoxing industry agglomeration area could have great influence on the ambient air quality, especially for the O3 concentration and the minimum contribution rate was 3.1%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhi-Rong", "Initials": "ZR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhe-Ming", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Ming-Zhu", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jian-Bo", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24881369"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
