The samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS to determine the MC-LR concentration and its removal efficiency during treatment process. The combination of actual water enrichment (including source water enrichment of 50 times and 1 500 times concentrated, finished water enrichment of 50 times and 2 500 times concentrated) and laboratory simulated water (including the mixture of MC-LR and liquid chlorine in the mass ratio of 1\u223610, 1\u223620, 1\u2236100 and 1\u22361 000, respectively) were used to qualitative analyze the MC-LR degradation products by Orbitrap mass spectrometry. <b>Results:</b> The linearity of MC-LR ranged from 2 to 200 \u03bcg/L with the detection limit of 0.007 9 \u03bcg/L and the limit of quantification of 0.026 3 \u03bcg/L. The recovery rate of MC-LR from different contration in drinking water were from 94.88%-101.47%. The intra-day precision was 2.51%-7.93% and the intra-day precision was 3.24%-8.41%. The average concentration of MC-LR in source water was (0.631\u00b10.262) \u03bcg/L, 94.0% of which can be removed by ozone exposure while the concentrate was (0.038\u00b10.016) \u03bcg/L, biological pre-treatment and chlorination. The remaining can hardly be removed by sand filtration, ozone exposure, activated carbon, ultrafiltration and other processes. The MC-LR average concentration in the finished water maintained at about (0.036\u00b10.016) \u03bcg/L. Degradation products including hydroxy-microcystin, methyl-hydroxy-microcystin, methyl-microcystin were identified in the laboratory simulated water of the mixture of MC-LR and liquid chlorine in the mass ratio of 1\u223610. <b>Conclusion:</b> The established MC-LR detection method can be well applied to the monitoring of MC-LR in drinking water due to its simple pre-treatment process and good methodological validation parameters.
