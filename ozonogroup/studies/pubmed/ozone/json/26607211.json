Infestations of T. putrescentiae are controlled with the fumigant methyl bromide, which is an ozone-depleting substance and is currently being banned in most countries. Effective alternatives to methyl bromide are needed. The objective of this research was to use laboratory assays to investigate the effectiveness of food-safe compounds for preventing infestation of T. putrescentiae on dry-cured hams.", "Ham pieces dipped in solutions of either propylene glycol (1,2-propanediol), lard, ethoxyquin or butylated hydroxytoluene prevented or significantly reduced mite population growth. Behavioral assays revealed that more mites oriented to the untreated control ham cubes, and more eggs were laid on these untreated ham cubes, compared with cubes treated with various dips. Our results also indicated that a combination of carrageenan + propylene glycol alginate + 40% propylene glycol was effective in reducing mite numbers on whole aging hams compared with untreated whole hams.", "Several food-safe compounds can prevent infestation of T. putrescentiae on dry-cured hams and may represent alternatives for managing this pest. \u00a9 2015 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA."}], "LastName": "Abbar", "ForeName": "Salehe", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA."}], "LastName": "Amoah", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Schilling", "ForeName": "M Wes", "Initials": "MW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA."}], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Thomas W", "Initials": "TW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Acaridae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Food, Preserved"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26607211", "10.1002/ps.4196"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
