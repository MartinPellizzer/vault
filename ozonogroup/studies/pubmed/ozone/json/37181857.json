A Total 20 healthy male Wistar albino rats (weighing 250 - 300 g with the age of 16 weeks) were used. They were divided into groups (experimental and control groups) of 10 rats being housed individually and fed <i>ad libitum</i>. The HFA (2.00%) burn was created in all animals. The ozonized (20.00 \u00b5g O<sub>3</sub> mL<sup>-1</sup>) bi-distilled water was applied as a drop (10.00 \u00b5L each drop) every 8 hr for 7 days in the experimental group. At the same time, 0.90% NaCl was applied as drop (10.00 \u00b5L each drop) every 8 hr for 7 days in the control group. In the experimental group, intensive inflammation, angiogenesis, epithelial damage and stromal edema were detected in one animal. Epithelial vascularization and stromal edema were seen in four animals. In control group, only two animals' corneal structures were normal. Inflammation, angiogenesis, epithelial damage, fibrosis, epithelial vascularization and stromal edema were detected in the rest. As a result of this study, it was observed that local usage of ozone therapy had a positive effect on the healing of corneal burns caused by HFA. It was concluded that more ozone-related studies should be done to enlighten the subject."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Urmia University.
