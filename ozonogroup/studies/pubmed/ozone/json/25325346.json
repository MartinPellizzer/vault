In this study, gaseous ozone was used to treat both DON solution and scabbed wheat to investigate the effectiveness of ozone treatment on DON degradation and the effect of ozone on the quality parameters of wheat. It was found that gaseous ozone had a significant effect on DON reduction in solution, when 10 mg l(-1) gaseous ozone was used to treat a 1 \u03bcg ml(-1) of DON solution, the degradation rate of DON was 93.6% within 30 s. Lower initial concentrations of DON solution treated with higher concentrations of ozone, and longer times showed higher DON degradation rates. Gaseous ozone was effective against DON in scabbed wheat. The degradation rate of DON increased with ozone concentration and processing time. The correlation between the time and degradation rate was y = -1.1926x(2) + 11.427x - 8.7787. In the process of ozone oxidation, a higher moisture content of wheat was more sensitive than that of lower moisture content to ozone under the same conditions. All samples were treated with different concentrations of ozone for 4 h to investigate the effect of ozone on wheat quality. No significant detrimental changes in the starch pasting properties of wheat were observed after all the samples were treated with ozone within 4 h. On the other hand, there was a slight rise in the dough development time and stability time, which meant the quality of flour improved after ozone treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Food Science and Technology; Henan Food Crop Collaborative Innovation Center, Henan University of Technology , Zhengzhou , Henan , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "E Q", "Initials": "EQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichothecenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JT37HYP23V", "NameOfSubstance": "deoxynivalenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Quality"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trichothecenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25325346", "10.1080/19440049.2014.976596"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
