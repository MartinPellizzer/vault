Arg.) Zahlbr. to real concentrations of atmospheric pollutants measured by two automatic monitoring stations, was studied in C\u00f3rdoba City, Argentina. The influence of different weather conditions on the biomonitor's response was also assessed. The concentration of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, hydroperoxy-conjugated dienes, and malondialdehyde were quantified in lichen thalli collected from a clean area and in transplanted thalli after 1 month of exposure in an urban area, from April to October, 1996. The dry weight/fresh weight, chlorophyll b/chlorophyll a and phaeophytin a/chlorophyll a ratios were also calculated. Data sets were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance and correlation analysis. It was observed that hydroperoxy-conjugated dienes, malondialdehyde, chlorophylls, and pigment degradation increase during winter-time, when higher levels of suspended particles, non-methane hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and ozone were also measured. These findings would be connected mainly with meteorological conditions, as most pollutants did not exceed prescribed threshold levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Multidisciplinario de Biolog\u00eda Vegetal (IMBIV.
