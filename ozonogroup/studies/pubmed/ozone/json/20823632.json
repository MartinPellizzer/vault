Welding fume metals and irritant gases nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) were sampled for thirty-eight workers. Personal exposure air samples for welding fume metals were collected on 37 mm open face cassettes and nitrogen dioxide and ozone exposure samples were collected with diffusive passive samplers. Samples were analyzed for metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and welding fume metal exposure concentrations were defined as the sum of welding-related metals mass per volume of air sampled. Welding fume metal exposures were highly variable among similar types of welding while NO(2) and O(3) exposure were less variable. Welding fume metal exposures were significantly higher 474 \u03bcg/m(3) for welders than non-welders 60 \u03bcg/m(3) (p=0.001). Welders were exposed to higher concentrations of NO(2) and O(3) than non-welders but the differences were not statistically significant. Welding fume metal exposure concentrations for welders performing gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) were higher than welders performing gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Non-welders experienced exposures similar to GTAW welders despite a curtain wall barrier separating welding and non-welding work areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Washington State Department of Labor & Industries, PO Box 44330, Olympia, WA 98504, USA. scto235@lni.wa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schoonover", "ForeName": "Todd", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Conroy", "ForeName": "Lorraine", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lacey", "ForeName": "Steven", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plavka", "ForeName": "Julie", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "2985065R", "ISSNLinking": "0019-8366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20823632", "10.2486/indhealth.ms1150", "JST.JSTAGE/indhealth/MS1150"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
