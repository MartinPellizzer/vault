Gatifloxacin (GAT), the fourth generation of fluoroquinolones, has been widely used to treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and has a limited metabolization. The present study aimed to evaluate ozonation as a technique to degrade GAT. An exchange A UHPLC-MS/MS by an UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the residual of GAT and to assess its degradation products. The removal efficiency was higher under alkaline conditions (pH = 10), reaching up to 99% of GAT after 4 min. It was also observed that the first ozone attack on the GAT molecule was through the carboxylic group. In contrast, under acid conditions (pH = 3), the ozone attack was first to the piperazinyl ring. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis as test organisms, and it was observed that the residual activity reduced most under alkaline conditions. In contrast, the best condition to remove the residual toxicity evaluated for the marine bacteria V. fischeri was the acidic one. Due to this, ozonation seemed to be an exciting process to remove GAT in aqueous media."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering, Architecture and Urban Design, University of Campinas, P.O.
