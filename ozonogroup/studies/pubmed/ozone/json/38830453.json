In experimental studies, exposure to ozone during sensitive windows in the sperm lifecycle has been associated with impaired sperm motility. Subsequently, we sought to investigate the effects of episodic exposure to ozone during sperm maturation in the rat. Long-Evans rats were exposed to either filtered air or ozone (0.4 or 0.8\u202fppm) for five non-consecutive days over two weeks. Ozone exposure did not impact male reproductive organ weights or sperm motility \u223c24\u202fhours following the final exposure. Furthermore, circulating sex hormones remained unchanged despite increased T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> in the 0.8\u202fppm group. While there was indication of altered adrenergic signaling attributable to ozone exposure in the testis, there were minimal impacts on small non-coding RNAs detected in cauda sperm. Only two piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were altered in the mature sperm of ozone-exposed rats (piR-rno-346434 and piR-rno-227431). Data across all rats were next analyzed to identify any non-coding RNAs that may be correlated with reduced sperm motility. A total of 7 microRNAs (miRNAs), 8 RNA fragments, and 1682 piRNAs correlated well with sperm motility. Utilizing our exposure paradigm herein, we were unable to substantiate the relationship between ozone exposure during maturation with sperm motility. However, these approaches served to identify a suite of non-coding RNAs that were associated with sperm motility in rats. With additional investigation, these RNAs may prove to have functional roles in the acquisition of motility or be unique biomarkers for male reproductive toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, U S.
