Drylands are constraint for sustainable agriculture and risk for food security, and expected to increase over time. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), a potent greenhouse gas with ozone reduction potential, is significantly influenced by microbial communities in drylands. However, our understanding of the biological mechanisms and processes behind N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in these areas is limited, despite the fact that they highly account for total gaseous nitrogen (N) emissions on Earth. This review aims to illustrate the important biological pathways and microbial players that regulate N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in drylands, and explores how these pathways might be influenced by global changes for example N deposition, extreme weather events, and climate warming. Additionally, we propose a theoretical framework for manipulating the dryland microbial community to effectively reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions using evolving techniques that offer inordinate specificity and efficacy. By combining expertise from different disciplines, these exertions will facilitate the advancement of innovative and environmentally friendly microbiome-based solutions for future climate change vindication approaches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
