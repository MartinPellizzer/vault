The ozonolysis made it possible to significantly reduce the formation times of 3-methoxy-2-methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid because the previously required extraction, clean-up and other procedures could be entirely eliminated. The resulting intact 2-methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid was directly analyzed by thermospray-liquid or electron ionization-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and the procedures from ozonolysis to analysis of microcystins at the pmole levels were performed within only 30 min. The calibration curves obtained by thermospray-liquid or electron ionization-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed a linear relationship from 14 to 830 pmole and from 2.5 to 100 pmole of microcystin-LR, respectively. The method was applied to the detection and determination of the total amount of microcystins in bloom and cultured samples, showing that it provided a means of not only screening for microcystins but of their accurate quantitation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harada", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murata", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiang", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicon", "NlmUniqueID": "1307333", "ISSNLinking": "0041-0101"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-methoxy-2-methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylbutyrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "77238-39-2", "NameOfSubstance": "microcystin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7WY7YBI87E", "NameOfSubstance": "4-phenylbutyric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.16", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylbutyrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8817814", "10.1016/0041-0101(95)00163-8", "0041010195001638"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
