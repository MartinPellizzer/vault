Group 1 received intradiscal ozone therapy (n = 35) and Group 2 received intradiscal ozone therapy with periforaminal steroid injection (n = 30). Patients were evaluated for pain using the visual analogue scale (VAS), for disability using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and for quality of life using the short form 36 health survey administered pre-injection and at one and 6 months post-injection. All procedures were performed under sterile conditions using C-arm fluoroscopy.", "Significant improvements were observed in pain, disability, and quality of life in both groups post-treatment compared to pre-injection. Mean pre-injection VAS was not significantly different between the groups (VAS: 7.8 \u00b1 1.1 for Group 1, 7.8 \u00b1 1.2 for Group 2). VAS values at 6 months for Group 1 and Group 2 were as follows: 3.6 \u00b1 2.4, 4.1 \u00b1 1.6, respectively) (P < 0.001).
