Increased nitrogen emissions may lead to environmental impacts including photochemical air pollution, reduced visibility, changes in biodiversity, and stratospheric ozone depletion. In the last 50 yr, emissions of ammonia (NH3), which is the most abundant form of reduced reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere, have significantly increased as a result of intensive agricultural management and greater livestock production in many developed countries. These agricultural production practices are increasingly subject to governmental regulations intended to protect air resources. It is therefore important that an accurate and robust agricultural emission factors database exist to provide valid scientific support of these regulations. This paper highlights some of the recent work that was presented at the 2006 Workshop on Agricultural Air Quality in Washington, D.C. regarding NH3 emissions estimates and emission factors from agricultural sources in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, several best management practices are explored as the scientific community attempts to maximize the beneficial use of reactive nitrogen while simultaneously minimizing negative environmental impacts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dep. of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences, North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA. viney_aneja@ncsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aneja", "ForeName": "Viney P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blunden", "ForeName": "Jessica", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "James", "ForeName": "Kristen", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlesinger", "ForeName": "William H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knighton", "ForeName": "Raymond", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilliam", "ForeName": "Wendell", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jennings", "ForeName": "Greg", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niyogi", "ForeName": "Dev", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cole", "ForeName": "Shawn", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Qual", "NlmUniqueID": "0330666", "ISSNLinking": "0047-2425"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Husbandry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18389937", "10.2134/jeq2007.0002in"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
