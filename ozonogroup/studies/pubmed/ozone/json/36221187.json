The influence of ozone and naringine on colitis-mediated testicular dysfunction was investigated in this study. Forty-eight adult male rats were divided into four groups: I control group, II dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) UC-induced group, III DSS+naringine, and IV DSS+ozone groups. UC was induced in groups II, III, and IV using 0.1\u00a0ml of 4% DSS in their drinking water per day for 6\u00a0days by gastric gavage. All animals were sacrificed 45\u00a0days from the start. Blood samples were obtained to estimate serum testosterone hormone. Testicular tissues were processed for measurement of tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and examined by light and electron microscopes. Ultrastructurally, group II revealed a relatively thick basement membrane enveloping the seminiferous tubule. Sertoli cell cytoplasm appears rarified with wide intracellular spaces, vacuoles, and multiple lysosomes; distorted spermatogonia with electron dense nuclei and cytoplasm; and primary spermatocytes with small nuclei and electron dense cytoplasm. Abnormal sperm profiles were visible in middle pieces, mid, principle, and end pieces that were markedly affected with disorganization of axoneme and outer dense fibers. Leydig cells revealed dilated cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Morphometric and statistical analyses were performed. Group III showed some improvement; however, group IV showed more improvement. The results indicated that ozone caused marked improvement than naringine against UC-induced testicular damage via their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Azmy", "ForeName": "Abeer M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd Elbaki", "ForeName": "Bassant T", "Initials": "BT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Mohammed A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mahmoud", "ForeName": "Abeer A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ultrastruct Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8002867", "ISSNLinking": "0191-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9042-14-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Dextran Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N7TD9J649B", "NameOfSubstance": "naringin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Colitis, Ulcerative"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dextran Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Semen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36221187", "10.1080/01913123.2022.2132337"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
