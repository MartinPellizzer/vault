As an illustrative example, we analyzed the impact of pollution on the frequency of emergency department (ED) visits due to colitis among young patients (age < 15 years, N = 11 110). Our technique involves 2 steps. First, we considered 6 ambient air pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, and 2 measures of particulate matter) treating each pollutant as a single exposure. Odds ratios (ORs) for ED visits associated with a standard increase (interquartile range - IQR) in the pollutants levels were calculated using the case-crossover technique. The ORs and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were also found for lagged exposures (for lags 1-9 days). Second, we defined a Health Air Study Index (HASI) to represent the combined impact of the 6 air pollutants.", "We obtained positive and statistically significant results for individual air pollutants and among them the following estimations: OR = 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02-1.1, NO2 lag 3, IQR = 12.8 ppb), OR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.07, SO2 lag 4, IQR = 2.3 ppb), OR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1-1.06, PM lag 3, IQR = 6.2 \u03bcg/m3). Among the re-calculated ORs with the HASI values as an exposure, the highest estimated value was OR = 1.37 (95% CI: 1.12-1.68, for 1 unit of the HASI, lag 3).", "The proposed index (HASI) allows to confirm the pattern of associations for lags obtained for individual air pollutants. In the presented example the used index (HASI) indicates the strongest relation with the exposure lagged by 3 days."], "CopyrightInformation": "This work is available in Open Access model and licensed under a CC BY-NC 3.0 PL license."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Canada, Ottawa, Canada (Population Studies Division). mietek.szyszkowicz@hc-sc.gc.ca."}], "LastName": "Szyszkowicz", "ForeName": "Mieczyslaw", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Occup Med Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9437093", "ISSNLinking": "1232-1087"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Illness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26224494", "10.13075/ijomeh.1896.00380", "58521"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
