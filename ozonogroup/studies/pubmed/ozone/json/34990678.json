Recent studies have shown that another upper core of the OV appeared in the middle and upper stratosphere (10-2\u00a0hPa); however, the formation mechanism of the OV in the upper stratosphere remains unclear. In this paper, Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data from the Aura satellite and the stratospheric heterogeneous chemical reaction box model are used to investigate the impact of chemical substances, including NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, Cl and Br, on the ozone valley in the middle and upper stratosphere over the TP. The results show that the formation mechanism of the diurnal and nighttime variation in the upper core of the OV over the TP in the summer may be related to the different daytime and nighttime distributions of NO<sub>2</sub> and the difference in daytime and nighttime average temperatures between the TP and the same latitude regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
