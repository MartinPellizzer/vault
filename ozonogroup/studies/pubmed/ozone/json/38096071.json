As a common biological engineering technology, biological fermentation exists with disadvantages such as low efficiency and complex process. Ozone pretreatments are commonly applied to improve this problem due to their high efficiency and low cost. In this study, the significant function of ozone in anaerobic fermentation gas production was verified with excess sludge. Compared with other untreated sludge, ozone pretreatment can effectively degrade activated sludge. After ozone treatment and mixing with primary sludge, the methane production of excess sludge increased by 49.30 and 50.78%, and the methanogenic activity increased by 69.99 and 73.83%, respectively. The results indicated that the mixing of primary sludge with excess sludge possessed synergistic effects, which contributed to the anaerobic fermentation of excess sludge. The results of microbial community structure exhibited that methanogenic processes mainly involve hydrogenogens, acidogens and methanogens. The relative abundance of both bacteria and microorganisms changed significantly in the early stage of hydraulic retention time, which coincided exactly with the gas production stage. This study provided a feasible pretreatment strategy to improve sludge biodegradability and revealed the role of microorganisms during anaerobic digestion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "P.G. and X.M. contributed equally to this work.
