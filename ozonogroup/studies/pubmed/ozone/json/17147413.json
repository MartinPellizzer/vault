As ozone is known to activate defense responses in plants, we have monitored the concentration of jasmonic acid in tomato leaves during and after an acute exposure to this abiotic elicitor. In this experiment, we observed that the maximum induction of jasmonic acid in O3-fumigated plants occurred 9 h after the end of treatment and the concentration of jasmonic acid in stressed plants increased 13-fold. However, the level of endogenous methyl-jasmonate was constant during the observed period. The extraction and quantification of jasmonic acid as its methyl ester was performed by headspace-solid-phase microextraction (or HS-SPME) in combination with GC-FID and GC-MS. The sensitivity (LOD = 2 ng/g) of this method permitted the detection and quantification of jasmonic acid present in plant tissues at very low concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Science, and Department of Plant Biology and Agro-Environmental and Animal Biotechnology, University of Perugia, Borgo XX Giugno 72, 06121 Perugia, Italy. zadra@unipg.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zadra", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borgogni", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marucchini", "ForeName": "Cesare", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6RI5N05OWW", "NameOfSubstance": "jasmonic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17147413", "10.1021/jf062249r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
