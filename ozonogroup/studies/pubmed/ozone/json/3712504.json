By cell manipulation of fibroblasts in culture, the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the phospholipids was increased from about 6% to about 40%. The cellular content of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) (vitamin E) could be drastically enhanced. Vitamin E supplementation to the cell did not influence the PUFA manipulation. Normal, PUFA, and PUFA(alpha-T) fibroblasts were exposed to ozone by bubbling 10 ppm through the cell suspensions for different periods of time (0-6 h). No significant effects of the ozone exposure could be established when normal fibroblasts were used. The PUFA fibroblasts, however, were very vulnerable to ozone toxicity, both in terms of dye uptake (Trypan blue) and cell death (clonogenic ability). When alpha-tocopherol was present in the cell (200 ng/10(6) cells), a clear protection against ozone toxicity was found. It is concluded that ozone toxicity might be higher under conditions of a relative high amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the membrane phospholipids of the cell and a low cellular antioxidant capacity. Cellular membranes are probably an important target for ozone-induced cell death."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konings", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Clone Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3712504", "10.1080/15287398609530888"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
