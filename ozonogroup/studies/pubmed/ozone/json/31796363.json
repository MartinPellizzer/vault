In this study, molecular transformation of DOM was revealed to identify the reactive mechanisms with (non-) radical reactive species in ozonation, electrolysis and E<sup>+</sup>-ozonation processes. Chlorine ions were efficiently activated into non-radical reactive chlorine species (RCS) with 245.7 mg/L, which was more dominant in electrolysis. Compared to ozonation, C<sub>\u2022OH</sub> was increased from 2.6 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> mg/L into 5.8 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> mg/L and the generation of Cl\u2022/ClO\u2022 could be concluded according to the decline of non-radical RCS in E<sup>+</sup>-ozonation process. For chromophoric and fluorescent DOM, aromatic compounds and polymerization degree dramatically decreased in E<sup>+</sup>-ozonation. Lipid-like and CRAM/lignin-like compounds were substantially degraded, as \u2022OH and ClO\u2022/Cl\u2022 shows an affinity towards oxygen-containing organic compounds via single electron transfer by attracting OH bonds. Especially, carbon/hydrogen/oxygen (CHO-containing) compounds were readily to be degraded with the removal efficiency of 92.5 %, 97.0 % and 98.4 % in electrolysis, ozonation and E<sup>+</sup>-ozonation, respectively. Moreover, nitrogen atoms have a negative effect on DOM degradation, and thus, carbon/hydrogen/nitrogen and carbon/hydrogen/nitrogen/sulfur (CHN- and CHNS-containing) compounds were considered as refractory compounds. This paper is expected to shed light on the synergetic effect in E<sup>+</sup>-ozonation and transformation of refractory DOM in CL treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
