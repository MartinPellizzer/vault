The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the global production of infectious waste, emphasizing the need for safe and sustainable waste management practices. While autoclaves are commonly used for on-site disposal, alternative methods like ozone gas and UV-C radiation offer environmentally friendly options that effectively eliminate pathogens without leaving toxic residues. Inadequate waste management can contribute to disease transmission, while open burning releases harmful pollutants. This study investigated the effectiveness of different disinfection agents - ozone gas and UV-C radiation - on infectious solid waste contaminated with bacteria. The bacterial indicators examined were <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The experimental methods included operating each ozone and UV-C radiation individually and simultaneously using ozone gas and UV-C radiation. The study also investigated exposure times and various concentrations of ozone gas. The findings demonstrated that the simultaneous application of ozone gas and UV-C radiation was the most effective method for decontaminating infectious solid waste and targeting the selected bacteria. The concentration of ozone gas ranged from 165 to 5000 ppm, depending on generation time and treatment chamber volume, while exposure times varied from 1 to 180\u2009minutes. In applying UV-C rays, complete elimination of <i>S. aureus</i> was observed after 60\u2009minutes up to 6-log, while the reduction of <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> were 2-log and 3-log, respectively. Ozone gas had the ability to inactivate all strains, but when ozone gas and UV-C rays were used simultaneously, this process was accelerated and improved. The total reduction in the bacterial load was 8-log. considering the increase in population and the subsequent increase in waste generation, adopting an environmentally friendly waste management method can be very advantageous.<i>Implication Statement</i>: The findings of this study) <b>Effective Methods for the Decontamination of Healthcare Waste: Ozone and UV-C Radiation Process (</b> have significant implications for public health and environmental sustainability, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. By demonstrating that the simultaneous application of ozone gas and UV-C radiation is highly effective in decontaminating infectious solid waste, this research provides a viable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional autoclave methods. Implementing these disinfection techniques can substantially reduce the risk of disease transmission and minimize the environmental impact of healthcare waste. The study's insights into optimal ozone gas concentrations and exposure times offer practical guidelines for developing scalable waste management systems that prioritize safety and sustainability. This advancement not only addresses immediate public health concerns but also contributes to the broader goal of sustainable waste management practices, setting a new standard for healthcare facilities worldwide. By adopting these methods, healthcare providers can ensure safer disposal of infectious waste, thereby protecting communities and the environment from hazardous pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohtasebi", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abedi Sarvestani", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dabiri", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadani", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alavi Bakhtiarvand", "ForeName": "Nadali", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abtahi", "ForeName": "Mehrnoosh", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Health, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alimi", "ForeName": "Rasoul", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39116420", "10.1080/10962247.2024.2388101"]}}]}
