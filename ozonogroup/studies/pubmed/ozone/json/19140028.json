It was demonstrated that the color and chemical oxygen demand removal in the sequential augmented MBR was about 90% and 50%, respectively. By ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, it was found that the introduced strain QYY was maintained as the predominant species and the diversity of the system was relatively low throughout the operation. Photocatalysis and ozonation processes were efficient to treat the effluents from MBR with high color and total organic carbon removal more than 90% within 120 min. Therefore, the hybrid treatment system is a possible way to achieve the complete mineralization of BAA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Biological Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering (Ministry of Education, China), Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Yuan-yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ji-ti", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gou", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Lin-lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8208561", "ISSNLinking": "0273-2289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBZ7FUN4BK", "NameOfSubstance": "bromamine acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19140028", "10.1007/s12010-008-8501-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
