The first set of testing consisted of both bait and the air purifier, whereas only bait was offered in the second testing set. The highest percent repellency was recorded among Cx. quinquefasciatus (83.23%) while Ae. aegypti (68.56%) was the least repelled by the air purifier tested. No mortality was observed in all testings. These results illustrated the potential use of the ozone-producing air purifier as a personal protection insect repellent device in premises. Nevertheless, in order to prevent dengue infection which is transmitted by both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, ozone-producing air purifier should be utilized concurrently with other vector control methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Sungai Buloh Campus, Jalan Hospital, 47000 Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HW CoRe, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), 40450 Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Wan-Norafikah", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Entomology Unit and WHO Collaborating Centre for Vectors, Infectious Diseases Research Centre (IDRC), Institute for Medical Research (IMR), Jalan Pahang, 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "H L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Entomology Unit and WHO Collaborating Centre for Vectors, Infectious Diseases Research Centre (IDRC), Institute for Medical Research (IMR), Jalan Pahang, 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Norazizah", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Entomology Unit and WHO Collaborating Centre for Vectors, Infectious Diseases Research Centre (IDRC), Institute for Medical Research (IMR), Jalan Pahang, 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mohamad-Hafiz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Trop Biomed", "NlmUniqueID": "8507086", "ISSNLinking": "0127-5720"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33579110"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
