Due to its high content of volatile solvents, the released VOCs not only have a negative impact on indoor air quality but also pose a health threat to nail salon workers who are highly exposed to such environments. The objectives of this research were to characterize VOCs emissions from detailed manicure processes and to evaluate the impact on the environment and health risks. Results showed that the VOCs concentration in the anti-warping treatment process was much higher than that in other manicure steps, at 360.69\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup>, making its contributions of OFP and SOA equally prominent. The trend of concentration contribution was similar to that of OFP, and OVOCs were the most significant contributor to the VOCs components in the whole manicure process. Since organic solvent nail gels were also frequently used in most steps, the main VOCs were methanol, ethanol and ethyl acetate. Aromatics were the component that contributed the most to SOA, and its contributions in all processes were >85\u00a0%. Health risk assessments performed in our study indicated that acrolein was the main non-carcinogen, and the carcinogenic risk of this study could be ignored. The results of this study can be used as a basis for controlling VOCs emission and reducing exposure to VOCs in nail salons."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
