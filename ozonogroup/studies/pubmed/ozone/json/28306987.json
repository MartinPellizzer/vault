Each regime was split into plants under high or low nutrient supply. \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C was increased (becoming less negative), in stems rather than leaves, by both high nutrition (+2\u2030) and O<sub>3</sub> stress (+1\u2030). Whereas high nutrition raised the wateruse efficiency (WUE) while lowering the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the inner leaf air space (c <sub>i</sub>), WUE decreased and c <sub>i</sub> increased under O<sub>3</sub> stress. Therefore, only the nutritional effect on the carbon isotope fractionation was reproduced by the model of Farquhar et al. (1982) which estimates WUE by means of \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C based on c <sub>i</sub>. c <sub>i</sub> was not biased by 'patchiness' in respect to stomatal opening. The latter was verified by microscopical analysis and the complete water infiltration of the birch leaves through the stomata, independent of the diurnal course of the leaf conductance for water vapour. Under low nutrient supply, the activity of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) was roughly doubled by ozone to about 1.3% of the total carboxylation capacity (by PEPC + rubisco), and was increased to 1.7% under high nutrition. The fractionation model, extended to account for varying activities of the carboxylating enzymes, indicated that stimulated PEPC was the cause of elevated \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C, although c <sub>i</sub> was increased under O<sub>3</sub> stress. The stimulation of PEPC and, as a consequence, elevated \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C are discussed as part of a whole-plant acclimation to O<sub>3</sub> stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232, Villigen, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saurer", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstrasee 111, CH-8903, Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maurer", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstrasee 111, CH-8903, Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "Rainer", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstrasee 111, CH-8903, Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Landolt", "ForeName": "Werner", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstrasee 111, CH-8903, Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcnthardt-Goerg", "ForeName": "Madeleine S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Institute, University of Berne, Sidlerstr. 5, CH-3012, Berne, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siegenthaler", "ForeName": "Ulrich", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Tree Physiol. 1995 Mar;15(3):159-65", "ArticleIdList": ["14965971"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1985 Nov 1;230(4725):566-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17809689"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Oct;73(2):291-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16663210"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Sep;97(1):313-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16668387"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Jan;74(1):12-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16663364"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1990 Jan;82(1):52-55", "ArticleIdList": ["28313137"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1989 Sep;21(3):161-9", "ArticleIdList": ["24424611"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Sep;88(1):218-23", "ArticleIdList": ["16666270"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1992 Apr;98(4):1310-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16668793"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Sep;91(1):427-32", "ArticleIdList": ["16667037"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1993;81(3):207-12", "ArticleIdList": ["15091806"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28306987", "10.1007/BF00328677", "10.1007/BF00328677"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
