Beryllium-7 (7Be) is produced in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere by the interaction of cosmogenic particles with atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen. 7Be has a 53.29-day half-life (478 keV gamma) and is known to attach to fine particles in the atmosphere once it is formed. It has been suggested that O3 from aloft can be transported into rural and urban regions during stratospheric-tropospheric folding events leading to increased background levels of O3 at the surface. 7Be can be used as a tracer of upper atmospheric air parcels and the O3 associated with them. Aerosol samples with a 2.5-microm cutoff were collected during 12-hr cycles (day/night) for a 30-day period at Deer Park, TX, near Houston, in August-September of 2000, and at Waddell, AZ, near Phoenix, in June-July of 2001. A comparison of 7Be levels with 12-hr O3 averages and maxima shows little correlation. Comparison of nighttime and daytime O3 levels indicate that during the day, when mixing is anticipated to be higher, the correlation of 7Be with O3 in Houston is approximately twice that observed at night. This is consistent with mixing and with the anticipated loss of O3 by reaction with nitric oxide (NO) and dry deposition. At best, 30% of the O3 variance can be explained by the correlation with 7Be for Houston, less than that for Phoenix where no significant correlation was seen. This result is consistent with the intercept values obtained for 7Be correlations with either O3 24-hr averages or O3 12-hr maxima and is also in the range of the low O3 levels (25 ppb) observed at Deer Park during a tropical storm event where the O3 is attributable primarily to background air masses. That is, maximum background O3 level contributions from stratospheric sources aloft are estimated to be in the range of 15-30 ppb in the Houston, TX, and Phoenix, AZ, area, and levels above these are because of local tropospheric photochemical production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439-4843, USA. gaffney@anl.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gaffney", "ForeName": "Jeffrey S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marley", "ForeName": "Nancy A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cunningham", "ForeName": "Mary M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotamarthi", "ForeName": "V Rao", "Initials": "VR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OW5102UV6N", "NameOfSubstance": "Beryllium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arizona"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Beryllium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16187592", "10.1080/10473289.2005.10464707"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
