We thus conducted a large cross-sectional study in Asia to investigate the role of air pollution in NAFLD.", "We recruited 329,048 adults (mean age: 41.0 years) without other liver disease (hepatitis and cirrhosis) or excessive alcohol consumption in Taiwan and Hong Kong from 2001 to 2018. The concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were estimated using a space-time regression model, and the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) was evaluated using a satellite-based spatio-temporal model. NAFLD was determined using either the fatty liver index (FLI) or the hepatic steatosis index (HSI). The NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis was defined according to BARD score or the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4). A logistic regression model was adopted to explore the relationships of ambient air pollution with the odds of NAFLD and NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis.", "We found positive relationships between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the odds of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, with every standard deviation (SD, 7.5\u202f\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) increases in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure being associated with a 10% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9%-11%) increment in the prevalence of NAFLD and an 8% (95% CI: 7%-9%) increment in the prevalence of advanced fibrosis. Similarly, the prevalence of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis increased by 8% (95% CI: 7%-9%) and 7% (95% CI: 6%-8%) with per SD (18.9\u202f\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) increasement in NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, respectively. Additionally, for every SD (9.9\u202f\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) increasement in O<sub>3</sub> concentration, the prevalence of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis decreased by 12% (95% CI: 11%-13%) and 11% (95% CI: 9%-12%), respectively.", "Higher ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> are linked with higher odds of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis. Our findings indicate that reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may be an effective way for preventing NAFLD. Further studies on O<sub>3</sub> are warranted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
