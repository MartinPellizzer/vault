Forty-two madibular premolar roots were cut, endodontically instrumented and irrigated with 2.5% NaOCl. Post spaces were prepared and roots were divided into three groups (n = 14). The antimicrobial pretreatment was conducted as follows: gaseous ozone, Nd:YAG laser and control (no additional disinfection methods). Scanning electron microscope analysis was made for each group (n = 2). A resin cement was used for luting the posts. For push-out test, each root was cut horizontally (two cervical, two middle and two apical). Statistical analyses were performed with one-way anova (\u03b1 = 0.05). Fracture types were observed. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in cervical and apical segments of laser and control groups (P < 0.05). The disinfection of the post spaces with Nd:YAG laser and ozone had no adverse effects on bond strength of glass-fibre post."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2010 The Authors.
