NIH male mice were randomly divided into three groups, O3 group, mice kept in 0.9 ppm O3 in a special room 12 hours/day for 12 days; Qigong group received Waiqi from a Qigong master for 30 minutes every morning in addition to what O3 group was treated; and a normal group for control. After 12 successive days, all the animals were decapitated and autopsy performed. Tissues taken from lung, liver, spleen and thymus were prepared for biochemical assay and microscopic examination. It was found that MDA content of lung and liver of O3 group was much higher than those of the control group and Qigong group. On the contrary, GSH-Px activity was significantly (P less than 0.001) lower than those of the control and Qigong groups. Both the MDA content and GSH-Px activity between the latter two groups were not significantly different. Microscopic examination revealed severe interstitial pneumonia with marked edema of lung and prominent leucocytic infiltration in liver of O3 group mice, but only slight changes were seen in Qigong group, so the differences were significant. The two immune organs of mice in O3 group were reduced in size and weight. Microscopic examination of immune organs of O3 group revealed thinner T lymphocyte population in cortex of thymus and periarterial sheath of spleen than those of Qigong group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8207427", "ISSNLinking": "0254-9034"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breathing Exercises"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2624990"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
