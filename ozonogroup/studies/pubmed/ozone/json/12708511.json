As a result, more environmentally benign alternative ABAs are being sought by the foam-blowing industry. This study examined the life cycle of HCFC-22, hydrofluorocarbon-134a (HFC-134a), and cyclopentane, which are currently used or considered as potential alternative ABAs in the manufacture of rigid polyurethane foams that serve as insulation in a model North American refrigerator. The raw material extraction/refining, manufacturing, use, and disposal stages of the life cycle of each ABA were considered, and their resulting relative impacts on ozone depletion and global warming were compared. The manufacturing, use, and disposal stages were determined to affect ozone depletion and global warming to the largest extent, emphasizing the need for a greater focus on pollution prevention opportunities in these stages. The HFC-134a life cycle yields no impact on ozone depletion and a significantly decreased global warming impact compared with its predecessor, HCFC-22, and a tradeoff of slightly higher global warming impact and fewer added safety concerns compared with its more flammable counterpart, cyclopentane."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Katz", "ForeName": "Seton", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lindner", "ForeName": "Angela S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyurethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9009-54-5", "NameOfSubstance": "polyurethane foam"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Construction Materials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyurethanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12708511", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466176"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
