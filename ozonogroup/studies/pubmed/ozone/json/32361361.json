Thus, we develop a data quality assurance and control scheme for aerosol lidar (TRANSFER) that mainly includes a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis (MCA) and bilateral filtering (BF). The AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) is utilized as the ground truth to evaluate the validity of TRANSFER, and the result exhibits a sharp 41% (0.36) decrease in root mean square error (RMSE), elucidating an acceptable overall performance of TRANSFER. The maximum removal of uncertainties appears in MCA with an RMSE of 0.08\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>, followed by denoising (DN) with 50% of MCA in RMSE. BF can smooth interior data without destroying the edge of the structure. The most noteworthy correction occurs in summer with an RMSE of 0.15\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8, and the least correction occurs in winter with values of 0.07\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> and 0.93, respectively. Overestimations of raw data are mostly identified, and representative values occur with weak southerly winds, low visibility, high relative humidity (RH) and high concentrations of both ground fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone. Apart from long-term variations, the intuitional variation in a typical overestimated pollution episode, especially represented by vertical profiles, shows a favorable performance of TRANSFER during stages of transport and local accumulation, as verified by backward trajectories. Few underestimation cases are mainly attributed to BF smoothing data with a sudden decrease. The main limitation of TRANSFER is the zigzag profiles found in a few cases with very small extinction coefficients. As a supplement to the research community of aerosol lidar and an exploration under complicated pollution in China, TRANSFER can aid in the preprocessing of lidar data-powered applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
