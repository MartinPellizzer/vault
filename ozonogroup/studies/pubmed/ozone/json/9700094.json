Rats were exposed to 0.8 parts/million O3 to induce lung inflammation. A second inflammatory stimulus, rabbit serum, was applied intratracheally to augment O3-induced inflammation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were analyzed for fibronectin protein and mRNA expression. Blood plasma was analyzed to investigate the potential of a minimally invasive procedure in predicting lung inflammation and fibronectin levels. Significant increases in the levels of fibronectin protein in the BALF and lung tissue after O3 exposure were further enhanced by pretreatment with normal serum. An increase in fibronectin mRNA following O3 exposure was also enhanced by serum pretreatment, which by itself had no effect on lung fibronectin mRNA expression. Plasma fibronectin levels were comparable in air-PBS and O3-PBS groups but increased in the O3-serum group. The results suggest leakage of fibronectin from blood plasma into the lung following intratracheal application of rabbit serum and upregulation of local synthesis following O3 exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reinhart", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhalla", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03521", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibronectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "blood", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fibronectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9700094", "10.1152/ajplung.1998.275.2.L330"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
