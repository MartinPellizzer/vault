The large amount of laundry wastewater (LWW) is generated by extensive human activities. LWW needs to be treated in order to tackle the challenging problem of water pollution and to accomplish water sustainability. To achieve this success, LWW can be reused for several purposes such as irrigation, construction activities, vehicle washing etc. However, there are several challenges in the reclamation of LWW like effective handling of the wastewater and meeting the regulatory criteria. Based on the literature review it seems that a single treatment process is not sufficient to treat LWW up to acceptable reuse standards. To that end, different treatment chains have been proposed: i) hybrid processes combining membrane filtration with adsorption; ii) advanced oxidation process using ultraviolet (UV) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>); iii) coagulation-flocculation combined with sand filtration; iv) combination of ozonation process, adsorption, and ultrafiltration (UF). This review paper discusses the selection of suitable treatment technology depends on several factors: i) a well-designed equipment, ii) cost-effectiveness of treatment method and iii) desired characteristics of the treated water. The review paper also presents solutions for treatment and reclamation of LWW."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRS Eau, Terre et Environnement, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sushil", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRS Eau, Terre et Environnement, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de recherche et de d\u00e9veloppement en agroenvironnement, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Mostafazadeh", "ForeName": "Ali Khosravanipour", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRS Eau, Terre et Environnement, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Lalit R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BOSK Bioproducts, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Technology, Huzhou University, Huzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Tyagi", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRS Eau, Terre et Environnement, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Drogui", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "VEOS Water, Saint-Roch-de-l'Achigan, Quebec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Brien", "ForeName": "Emmanuel", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36221933", "10.1080/10934529.2022.2132076"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
