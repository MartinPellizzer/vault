The BTEX concentration levels, composition, and evolutionary mechanisms during typical pollution episodes were investigated. The potential sources of BTEX were analyzed qualitatively using the diagnostic ratios method. Finally, the BTEX health risk was evaluated by using the human exposure analysis and evaluation method according to US EPA. The averaged total mixing ratio of BTEX were 1.32\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> and 4.83\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> during ozone pollution and haze episodes, respectively. Benzene was the most abundant species, followed by toluene. The mixing ratio of BTEX was largely affected by short southwestern distance transportation in January, while local emissions in July. In addition, the BTEX mixing ratio depended on the influence of temperature and relative humidity(RH) in July, while the concentration was more sensitive to changes in RH when the temperature was low in January. Diagnostic ratios and source implications suggested that the BTEX was affected mainly by biomass/biofuel/coal burning during haze episodes. The traffic related emissions also had an impact except for the influence of biomass/biofuel/coal burning in July. The averaged hazard quotient(HQ) values were 0.072 and 0.29 during ozone pollution and haze episodes, respectively, which were in the upper safety range limit recommended by the US EPA. The carcinogenic risk posed by benzene in both cleaning and pollution processes was higher than the safety threshold set by the US EPA, which should be monitored carefully."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying-Ruo", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Meteorological Observation Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing-le", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Nan-Nan", "Initials": "NN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zi-Ming", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qiang", "Initials": "ZQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34708960", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202104047"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
