The monthly average MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> exceeds \u223c70\u00a0ppb in more than half of the areas and shows a clear spatial gradient, with lower O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the southwest and higher in the northeast. Significant contributions of anthropogenic emissions to monthly average MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations of more than 20\u00a0ppb are predicted in the provincial capital Zhengzhou, mostly due to emissions from the transportation sector (\u223c50%) and in the areas in the north and northeast regions where industrial and power generation-related emissions are high. Biogenic emissions in the region only contribute to approximately 1-3\u00a0ppb of monthly average MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>. In industrial areas north of the province, their contributions reach 5-7\u00a0ppb. Two CMAQ-based O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub>x</sub>-VOCs sensitivity assessments (the local O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity ratios based on the direct decoupled method and the production ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to HNO<sub>3</sub>) and the satellite HCHO to NO<sub>2</sub> column density ratio consistently show that most of the areas in Henan are in NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime. In contrast, the high O<sub>3</sub> concentration areas in the north and at the city centers are in the VOC-limited or transition regimes. The results from this study suggest that although reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions to reduce O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the region is desired in most areas, VOC reductions must be applied to urban and industrial regions. Source apportionment simulations with and without Henan anthropogenic emissions show that the benefit of local anthropogenic NO<sub>x</sub> reduction might be lower than expected from the source apportionment results because the contributions of Henan background O<sub>3</sub> increase in response to the reduced local anthropogenic emissions due to less NO titration. Thus, collaborative O<sub>3</sub> controls in neighboring provinces are needed to reduce O<sub>3</sub> pollution problems in Henan effectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
