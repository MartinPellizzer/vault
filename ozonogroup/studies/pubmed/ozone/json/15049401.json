Air samples were collected using a volumetric spore trap. Meteorological variables and maximum and average pollutants were also included in the analysis. Linear regression analyses were performed for all environmental variables and symptom scores. Forward stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed to determine sets of variables that could be used to predict the conditions of increased symptom severity.", "Twenty-four patients participated in this study. The predominant spore types included Cladosporium, ascospores, and basidiospores. The predominant pollen type was Ambrosia. September was unusually hot and dry in Tulsa, but 161 mm of precipitation fell in October, primarily during the last 11 days. Two periods of peak symptoms occurred during the study, the first during the peak week of Ambrosia and the second after a 22 degrees C drop in temperature over 6 days. Numerous environmental variables showed significant correlations with symptom scores; however, there was no single predictive model for all symptoms.", "Ambrosia pollen and other environmental variables, including ozone levels, were significantly correlated with asthma and rhinitis symptoms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Science, The University of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74104, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newhouse", "ForeName": "Cashel P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Levetin", "ForeName": "Estelle", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ambrosia"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oklahoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Spores"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15049401", "10.1016/S1081-1206(10)61575-X", "S1081-1206(10)61575-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
