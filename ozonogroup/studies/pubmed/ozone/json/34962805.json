Herein, we introduced a novel integrated assessment system to optimize a NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and volatile organic compound (VOC) control strategy for the synergistic reduction of ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Focusing on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cities and their surrounding regions, which are experiencing the most serious PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China, we found that NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission reduction (64-81%) is essential to attain the air quality standard no matter how much VOC emission is reduced. However, the synergistic VOC control is strongly recommended considering its substantially human health and crop production benefits, which are estimated up to 163 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related) and 101 (O<sub>3</sub>-related) billion CHY during the reduction of considerable emissions. Notably, such benefits will be greatly reduced if the synergistic VOC reduction is delayed. This study also highlights the necessity of simultaneous VOC and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission control in winter while enhancing the NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> control in the summer, which is contrary to the current control strategy adopted in China. These findings point out the right pathways for future policy making on comitigating PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China and other countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research/Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Helsinki, 00014 Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Dian", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3716-8646"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9727-1963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuxiao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Zhaoxin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fenfen", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shuchang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Jiming", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34962805", "10.1021/acs.est.1c04201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
