However, the utilization efficiency of O<sub>3</sub> is constrained by its low solubility and short half-life during the treatment process. Herein, an integrated approach, using nanobubble technology and micro-environmental chemistry within cyclodextrin inclusion cavities, was studied in order to enhance the reactivity of ozonisation. Compared with traditional macrobubble aeration with O<sub>3</sub> in water, nanobubble aeration achieved 1.7 times higher solubility of O<sub>3,</sub> and increased the mass transfer coefficient 4.7 times. Moreover, the addition of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD) further increased the stability of O<sub>3</sub> through formation of an inclusion complex in its molecule-specific cavity. At a HP\u03b2CD:O<sub>3</sub> molar ratio of 10:1, the lifespan of O<sub>3</sub> reached 18 times longer than in a HP\u03b2CD-free O<sub>3</sub> solution. Such approach accelerated the removal efficiency of the model micropollutant, 4-chlorophenol by 6.9 times, compared with conventional macrobubble ozonation. Examination of the HP\u03b2CD inclusion complex by UV-visible spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analyses revealed that both O<sub>3</sub> and 4-chlorophenol entered the HP\u03b2CD cavity, and Benesi-Hildebrand plots indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry of the host and guest compounds. Additionally, molecular docking simulations were conducted in order to confirm the formation of a ternary complex of HP\u03b2CD:4-chlorophenol:O<sub>3</sub> and to determine the optimal inclusion mode. With these results, our study highlights the viability of the proposed integrated approach to enhance the ozonation of organic micropollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
