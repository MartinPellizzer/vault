However, difference in background water quality can have a significant influence on bromate depression. In this study, three bromide-bearing source waters (YZ, HR and HP) were selected to investigate bromate depression during the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-ozonation process. The results showed that there was strong correlation between bromate formation and molecular ozone consumption during ozonation process for the three waters. Compared to YZ and HR, ozone was consumed quickly within about 10\u00a0min for HP water, inducing lower bromate formation during ozonation process. In the initial step of bromide oxidation, molecular ozone oxidation was responsible for more than 80% of oxidation, much higher than that by hydroxyl radicals. Specifically, 94% of the oxidation of bromide occurred with ozone for YZ water, which might be attributed to the low concentration of organic matter in the water. The residual molecular ozone would be a restrictive factor and affect the bromate formation significantly. For YZ and HP water, as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (g/g) increased to 0.5, the ozone decomposition rate increased 61 times and 7.2 times respectively, which resulted in difference in bromate depression performance when applying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Humic acid and tyrosine in water were confirmed to have effects on bromate formation and depression after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition. This study could elucidate the different bromate depression effects occurring in different source waters when adding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which will provide an informative guide for bromate control in drinking water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
