Antioxidants are present in a wide range of fruits, vegetables, and spices. However, a considerable amount of antioxidants is lost during the post-harvest drying operation of agro produces for their shelf-life enhancement. Hence, retention of antioxidants becomes utmost importance in preserving the nutritional aspects of fruits and vegetables. Compared to conventional hot air drying, methods like freeze drying, vacuum drying, and dehumidified drying helps in the retention of antioxidants. However, the drawbacks prevalent in current drying practices, such as high-power consumption and high capital cost, could be eliminated by adopting novel drying mechanisms. This review focuses on various pretreatment methods like ultra-sonication, high pressure processing, pulsed electric field and ethanol treatment prior to drying operation helps in enhancing the drying efficiency with maximum retention of antioxidants. In addition, hybrid drying technologies such as microwave assisted drying, IR-radiated drying and electro-magnetic assisted drying methods also could significantly improve the retention of antioxidants.HIGHLIGHTSDrying is the most commonly adopted unit operation for enhancing the shelf life of perishable agro produces.However, drying is accompanied by loss of bioactive, color, texture, and sensory attributes.Compared to conventional drying techniques like hot air drying, methods like freeze drying, vacuum drying and dehumidified drying helps in the retention of antioxidants present in agro/food produces.Pretreatment methods like Ozonation, ultra-sonication, and UV radiation prior to drying are also found to improve the drying performance with good retention of antioxidants.Recent developments like microwave-assisted and IR-assisted drying methods perform well in the retention of antioxidants with less energy consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agro Processing and Technology Division, CSIR - National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "LastName": "Athira", "ForeName": "V A", "Initials": "VA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agro Processing and Technology Division, CSIR - National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "LastName": "Gokulvel", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agro Processing and Technology Division, CSIR - National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "LastName": "Nandhu Lal", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agro Processing and Technology Division, CSIR - National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "LastName": "Venugopalan", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Planning and Business Development, CSIR - National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "LastName": "Rajkumar"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agro Processing and Technology Division, CSIR - National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Venkatesh", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Drying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35653131", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2082371"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
