The highest decolorization efficiency of 96.04% was achieved by the ozone MB process with packing, which was 10.17% and 62.02% higher than that of the ozone MB process without packing and the ozone millimeter bubble(MLB) process, respectively while keeping other operating parameters the same. In addition, the saturation gas holdup, ozone mass transfer coefficient, and decolorization rate constant of the ozone MB process with packing were 15.32%, 0.260\u2005min<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.027\u2005min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, which were much better than those of the ozone MB process without packing and the ozone MLB process. The study also suggested that within a certain porosity range, the types of packings did not affect the performance of the ozone MB process in the degradation of MO. Moreover, the optimum operating conditions were initial concentration of MO of 30\u2005mg/L, initial pH of 3, circulating liquid flow of 75 L/h, and ozone dosage of 0.56\u2005mg/L. The decolorization efficiency was 99.28% within 120\u2005min."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jiakang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Jinliang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xiaoping", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3698-5844"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6B4TC34456", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl orange"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbubbles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35084290", "10.1080/09593330.2022.2034983"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
