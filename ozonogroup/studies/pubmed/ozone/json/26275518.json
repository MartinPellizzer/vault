The calibration of the scoring system was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow test, and the discriminative capacity was estimated with area under receiver operating characteristic curves. The incidence, patient characteristics, causes of intraoperative conversion to on-pump coronary artery bypass (ONCAB), and outcome were studied. The all-cause in-hospital mortality was 2.39%. Predicted mortality with the EuroSCORE II was 2.03\u00b11.63. Using the Hosmer Lemeshow test, a C statistic of 8.066 (p = 0.472) was obtained, indicating satisfactory model fit. The calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.706 (p = 0.0002), indicating good discriminatory power. Emergency intraoperative conversion to ONCAB occurred in 6.53% of patients. The mortality in the ONCAB group was significantly higher compared with patients who underwent successful OPCAB surgery (15.18% v 1.5%, p<0.0001). On multiple regression analysis with conversion to ONCAB as the endpoint, associated factors were patients with a higher EuroSCORE II (odds ratio = 1.13, confidence interval = 1.03-1.27) and more-than-trivial mitral regurgitation (odds ratio = 1.84, confidence interval = 1.07-3.06). Net reclassification improvement of 0.714 (p<0.0001) was obtained when on-pump conversion was added to the EuroSCORE II.", "The EuroSCORE II has satisfactory calibration and discrimination power to predict mortality after OPCAB surgery. Intraoperative conversion to ONCAB is a major complication of OPCAB surgery. A higher EuroSCORE II also predicts higher probability of conversion to ONCAB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.
