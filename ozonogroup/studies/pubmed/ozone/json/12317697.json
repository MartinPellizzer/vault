The lead levels were 40% higher than UN recommended standards and a photochemical cloud hung over the city. The preceding year, the UN had deemed Mexico City's microorganisms in the air uncountable. 1 billion pounds of fecal dust are estimated to waft through the city due to lack of bathrooms for 2.7 million persons. 11,000 tons of pollutants are in the air. Excessive amounts of ozone are in the air for 380 hours between January and June when the UN acceptable standard is .11 parts/million for 1 hour/year. The standards for acceptable carbon monoxide levels have also been exceeded by 200 days in 1990. However, improvements have been made and recognized as progress. Carbon monoxide has been reduced by 7% due to emission inspections twice/year, cleaner fuels, good weather, and a ban on use of cars on 1 workday/week. 30,000 cars have already been removed through inspection, but there are reports of widespread corruption and bribery in 28 of the 285 inspection stations. Airborne lead, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide have remained the same or been reduced. Future plans include the requirement for catalytic converters on an estimated 200,000 public vehicles. Within 5 years, 200 million trees are to be planted in the windward approaches to the city and 5 million in the city itself. The WHO standards for greenspace to help with reoxygenation of the air are fulfilled at only 315 of the expected level. Subway expansion is also planned by 1994. Air conditioned buses traveling on special routes will be offered, albeit at high fares. In order to reduce the pollution, which amounts to 83%, caused by cars, gas prices have been increased and a fuel tax of 12% has been added to fuel sales. 13% of pollution is caused by industry, of which 3 of the top 10 are state owned. Industry is being asked to install filters and scrubbers in a program underwritten by the Japanese. Thermal conversions occur particularly in winter because of the high altitude which causes incomplete combustion and 23% less oxygen than at sea level. Diplomats are offered hazard pay, weekend houses, and free air filters and medical checkups; children are advised to stay in the home country."]}], "OtherID": ["075264", "00214892"], "PMID": "12317697", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "04", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "1990", "Month": "Oct", "Day": "07"}}, "Title": "Baltimore sun", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sun"}, "ArticleTitle": "Mexico's war on pollution is netting some results.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "10A", "MedlinePgn": "10A"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mcclintock", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Sun", "NlmUniqueID": "101084448"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Latin America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organization and Administration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Program Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Welfare"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12317697"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
