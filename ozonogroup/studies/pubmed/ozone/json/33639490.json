High-resolution exposure data based on statistical models are needed. Our study aimed to build high-performance random forest (RF) models based on training data from 2013 to 2017 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in China at a 0.01\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.01\u00a0\u00b0 resolution, and estimated daily maximum 8h average O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-8hmax) concentration, daily average O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-mean) concentration, and daily maximum 1h O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-1hmax) concentration from 2010 to 2017. Model features included meteorological variables, chemical transport model output variables, geographic variables, and population data. The test-R<sup>2</sup> of sample-based O<sub>3</sub>-8hmax, O<sub>3</sub>-mean and O<sub>3</sub>-1hmax models were all greater than 0.80, while the R<sup>2</sup> of site-based and date-based model were 0.68-0.87. From 2010 to 2017, O<sub>3</sub>-8hmax, O<sub>3</sub>-mean, and O<sub>3</sub>-1hmax concentrations in the BTH region increased by 4.18\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 0.11\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and 4.71\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, especially in more developed regions. Due to the influence of weather conditions, which showed high contribution to the model, the long-term spatial distribution of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations indicated a similar pattern as altitude, where high concentration levels were distributed in regions with higher altitude."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
