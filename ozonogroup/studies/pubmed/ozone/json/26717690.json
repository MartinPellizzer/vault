The mechanisms of these three coexisting anions on bromate formation was analyzed based on the ozone decomposition, HOBr/OBr- formation, and transformation of total bromine species. Our results showed that adding of 3-150 mg.L-1 Cl- can reduce 8. 8%-25. 7% of bromate formation within 60 min. 63. 9% of bromate would be decreased by increasing SO(4)2- concentration from 0 mg.L-1 to 30 mg.L-1 within 20 min. However, more than 6. 4 times the mass concentrations of bromate were formed as HCO3- mass concentrations increased from 0 mg.L-1 to 30 mg.L-1 within 20 min. The production of bromate was slightly increased when HCO3- mass concentrations was above 30 mg.L-1. Under the condition of the same ozone dosage and reaction time, adding of Cl- and SO(4)2- will inhibit the formation of bromate during ozonation, while adding of HCOC3- significantly will increase the production of bromate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chun-de", "Initials": "CD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "L\u00fc-gang", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Bo-jie", "Initials": "BJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GHT9BV419J", "NameOfSubstance": "hypobromous acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26717690"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
