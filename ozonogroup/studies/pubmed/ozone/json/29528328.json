The catalyst was characterized by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Intermediate products were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and a pathway for hydroquinone degradation was proposed. The results showed that sludge pyrolyzed at 700 \u00b0C promoted hydroquinone degradation, compared with commercial activated carbon derived from coal. When the catalyst dose was 0.5 g/L, the hydroquinone (200 mg/L) removal rate reached 97.86% after exposure to ozone (the ozone concentration was 17 mg/L and the flow rate was 50 mL/min) for 60 min. The results indicated that basic groups contributed to the catalysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, 30 Puzhu Southern Road, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: 23656070@qq.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jinglu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, 30 Puzhu Southern Road, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: 23656070@qq.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, 30 Puzhu Southern Road, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: 23656070@qq.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, 30 Puzhu Southern Road, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: 23656070@qq.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhiying", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, 30 Puzhu Southern Road, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: 23656070@qq.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, 30 Puzhu Southern Road, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: 23656070@qq.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yanhua", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XV74C1N1AE", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroquinone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29528328", "10.2166/wst.2018.001"]}}]}
