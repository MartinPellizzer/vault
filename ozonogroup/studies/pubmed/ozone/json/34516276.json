UV-C is a powerful disinfection method that is commonly used to sterilize fluids, air, and surfaces. There is a little knowledge of the effects of UV-C radiation on living bodies. The purpose of this study is to examine the ameliorative effect of UV-C on skin lesions in mice that have been experimentally created and infected with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, and <i>Streptococcus</i> sp. In total, 32 mice were used, and 4\u2005mm skin defects were created and lesions infected with bacteria. Half of the mice in each group were treated with 254\u2005nm UV-C twice a day for 4 days before being euthanatized. Blood samples were collected for hematological analysis, while skin samples were collected for microbiological, pathological, and immunohistochemical examinations. In addition, pathological examinations were performed on visceral organ samples. UV-C treatment caused rapid healing and complete or significant disinfection of skin lesions. Moreover, UV-C treatment reduced caspase-3 expressions in lesioned areas, according to immunochemistry. There were no pathological findings in visceral organs as a result of UV-C treatment. This study found that UV-C can be used to treat and disinfect infected skin lesions in short period and repeated doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1835-1082"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["175651"], "Affiliation": "Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Burdur, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozmen", "ForeName": "Ozlem", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["175651"], "Affiliation": "Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Burdur, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sababoglu", "ForeName": "Ezgi", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["175651"], "Affiliation": "Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Burdur, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozyildiz", "ForeName": "Zafer", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["175651"], "Affiliation": "Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Burdur, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Milletsever", "ForeName": "Adem", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["175651"], "Affiliation": "Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Burdur, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Okuyucu", "ForeName": "Gozde", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Low Extrem Wounds", "NlmUniqueID": "101128359", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7346"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soft Tissue Injuries"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34516276", "10.1177/15347346211041869"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
