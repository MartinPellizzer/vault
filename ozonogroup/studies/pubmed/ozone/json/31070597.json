The results showed that higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate (40.1%) and acidification degree (27.6%) were obtained at pH 8.0 than those at pH 6.0 and pH 4.0. The concentration of extractable extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in the sludge gradually decreased with the pH decreasing from 8.0 to 4.0. A similar change was also observed for the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) in the effluent. The optimal detoxification efficiency by the HA process was obtained at pH 8.0, with higher removal efficiency (all higher than 90%) of the main toxic pollutants (crotonaldehyde, 5-formyl-6-methyl-4,5-dihydropyran, etc.) and higher anaerobic biodegradation rate (44.5%) in biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay. Among the predominant genera, the Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were possibly related to biodegradation of pollutants, since their higher relative abundance also coincided with the better performance of the HA process at pH 8.0."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730000, China; State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China E-mail: zhouyuexi@263.net."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China E-mail: zhouyuexi@263.net."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Zhiqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Petrochemical Company, Ltd, PetroChina, Jilin 132022, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chunyu", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China E-mail: zhouyuexi@263.net."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yudong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zongpu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China E-mail: zhouyuexi@263.net."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Guangqing", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hunan University and Key Laboratory of Environmental Biology and Pollution Control (Hunan University), Ministry of Education, Changsha, Hunan 410082, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Zhenfeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China E-mail: zhouyuexi@263.net."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yuexi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G72074TUW", "NameOfSubstance": "2-butenal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbiota"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31070597", "10.2166/wst.2019.118"]}}]}
