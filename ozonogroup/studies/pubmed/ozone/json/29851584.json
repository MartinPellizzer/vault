In the present study, we aim to examine whether short-term elevations in air pollution are associated with increased numbers of emergency hospital admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding in Hong Kong.", "Daily air pollution (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2\u00b75 \u03bcm [PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>], nitric oxide [NO<sub>2</sub>], sulpher dioxide [SO<sub>2</sub>], and ozone [O<sub>3</sub>]) data during 2005-10 were collected from the Environmental Protection Department and emergency admission data for peptic ulcer bleeding in elderly people (aged 65 years or older) from the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. A time stratified case-crossover analysis with conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the excess risk of peptic ulcer bleeding associated with each air pollutant, in single-pollutant and multi-pollutant models. Cardiorespiratory diseases were used as positive controls.", "8566 emergency admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding were recorded among Hong Kong's elderly population during 2005-10; the daily number of admissions ranged from 0 to 13. An IQR increment of 5-day moving average (lag<sub>04</sub>) of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration (25\u00b78 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) was associated with a 7\u00b76% (95% CI 2\u00b72-13\u00b72) increase in emergency admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding. Multi-pollutant models confirmed the robustness of the risk estimates for NO<sub>2</sub>. Other pollutants (PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>) were not associated with peptic ulcer bleeding admissions.", "Short-term elevation in ambient NO<sub>2</sub> might trigger peptic ulcer bleeding events and increase the risk of emergency admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding in Hong Kong's elderly population.
