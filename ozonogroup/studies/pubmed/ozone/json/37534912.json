Additional factors affecting alternative refrigerant choice include safety (i.e., flammability and toxicity), environmental, and thermodynamic constraints. At the same time, manufacturers are incentivized to seek refrigerants with higher energy efficiency, which saves on electricity costs and reduces indirect greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation. The life cycle climate performance (LCCP) metric is commonly used to assess the combined direct and indirect climate impacts of refrigerant-use equipment. Here, we consider an additional impact on climate performance: the degradation of refrigerant in equipment, i.e., the direct climate impacts of high-GWP byproducts that can form as the result of adding trifluoroiodomethane (CF<sub>3</sub>I) to refrigerant blends to reduce flammability. Such a production of high-GWP gases could change the acceptability of CF<sub>3</sub>I-containing refrigerants. Further, it highlights the need to understand refrigerant degradation within equipment in calculations of the environmental acceptability of new cooling technology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0008-8567-6638"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, Washington, D.C. 20016, United States."}], "LastName": "Taddonio", "ForeName": "Kristen N", "Initials": "KN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, Washington, D.C. 20016, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. 20007, United States."}], "LastName": "Dreyfus", "ForeName": "Gabrielle B", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7600-0240"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, Washington, D.C. 20016, United States."}], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "Stephen O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9059-8437"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Chemistry and Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Ravishankara", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42A379KB0U", "NameOfSubstance": "trifluoroiodomethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rwanda"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37534912", "10.1021/acs.est.3c01079"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
