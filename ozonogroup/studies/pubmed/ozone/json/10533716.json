It was found that the synergistic effects of combination of photolysis and ozonation increased obviously with increasing initial pH of solution to basic pH levels. Results showed that the synergistic effects of photolytic ozonation under the conditions imposed was notable with mineralization rate enlarging more than 100%, oxidation index (OI) decreasing 50%, and microtoxicity being reduced by 30%, indicating that the potentialities of photolytic ozonation compared to direct photolysis and ozonation alone was remarkable for treatment of industrial wastewater containing chlorophenols."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, National Lien-Ho College of Technology and Commerce, Miao-Li, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10533716", "10.1016/s0045-6535(99)00080-6", "S0045653599000806"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
