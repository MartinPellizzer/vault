However, its catalytic activity is restricted due to its limited active sites and low electron transfer efficiency. In this study, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and Cu<sup>0</sup> were doped with CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to introduce more O<sub>V,</sub> providing more active sites and improving electron transfer efficiency. Experimental results show that the optimum removal efficiency of the catalytic ozonation of Norfloxacin (NOR, a widely used antibiotic) using CTAB doped with Cu-CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as the catalyst is 81.58% with a first-order reaction kinetics constant of 0.03967 min<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>. The associated O<sub>3</sub> and catalyst dosages are 2.72\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.1\u00a0g\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, which are 1.63 times and 2.22 times higher than those in an equivalent O<sub>3</sub> system. O<sub>V</sub> can provide generation sites for surface hydroxyl groups and trigger \u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> as the main active oxygen species. The synergistic redox cycles of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Cu<sup>0</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> accelerate electron transfer efficiency. The possible degradation pathways of NOR are identified as defluorination, naphthyridine ring-opening and piperazine ring-opening. In summary, this work proposes a new strategy for the modification of CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts and provides new insights into the catalytic ozonation mechanisms for NOR removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
