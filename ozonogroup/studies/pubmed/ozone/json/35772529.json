The synthetic musks containing olefin moieties with electron-donating alkyl substituents such as octahydro tetramethyl naphthalenyl ethanone (OTNE) and ambrettolide (AMBT) showed high reactivity toward ozone (k \u2265 3.7 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and free available chlorine (FAC) (k = 9.2 - 88 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), while all other synthetic musks were less ozone reactive (k = 0.3 - 560 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and FAC-refractory. All synthetic musks showed high <sup>\u2022</sup>OH reactivity (k > 5 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), except musk ketone (MK) (k = 2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). In concordance with the kinetic information, OTNE and AMBT were efficiently eliminated (>97%) in simulated ozone treatments of drinking water at a specific ozone dose of 0.5 gO<sub>3</sub>/gDOC. The elimination levels of the other synthetic musks were below 50% at 0.5 gO<sub>3</sub>/gDOC. The fluence-based UV photolysis rate constant of the synthetic musks was determined to be (0.2 - 2.7) \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/mJ. The elimination levels of synthetic musks during UV alone treatment ranged from 7 to 81% at a UV fluence of 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The addition of 10 mg/L H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) significantly enhanced the elimination of most synthetic musks (achieving >90% elimination at 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>), indicating that the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH reaction was mainly responsible for their elimination. The addition of 10 mg/L FAC (UV/FAC) also significantly enhanced the elimination of olefinic and aromatic synthetic musks (>90%), for which the reaction with ClO<sup>\u2022</sup> was mainly responsible. For MK and two alkyl synthetic musks, their elimination during UV/FAC treatment was still limited (28 - 64%) and was mainly achieved by UV photolysis or reaction with <sup>\u2022</sup>OH. In summary, this study substantiates the chemical kinetics approach as a helpful tool for predicting or interpreting the elimination of micropollutants during oxidative water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
