However, quantitative studies of regional ozone impact due to ESCP, in terms of how ESCP would affect and to what extent ESCP could impact, are still lacking. This paper reports a systematic study on regional air quality impact from an olefin plant emergency shutdown due to the sudden failure of its cracked gas compressor (CGC). It demonstrates that emergency shutdown may cause significant ozone increment subject to different factors such as the starting time of emergency shutdown, flare destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) and plant location. In our studied case, the 8-hr ozone increment ranges from 0.4 to 3.3\u202fppb under different starting time, from 3.3 to 24.8\u202fppb under different DRE, and from 1.6 to 3.3\u202fppb under different locations. The results enable us to understand how and to what extent emergency operating activities of the chemical process will affect local air quality, which might be beneficial for decision makings on emergency air-quality response and control in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
