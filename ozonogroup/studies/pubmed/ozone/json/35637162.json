In recent years modern methods of physical medicine in comprehensive treatment have been used often including ozone therapy. The study included 54 patients, 25 male and 29 female in age between 39 and 87 years (mean age: 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9 years) with venous leg ulcers who underwent a cycle of local ozone therapy. The progress in wound healing was evaluated by computerized planimetry and pain intensity was assessed with use a visual analog scale (VAS) . As a result of the applied local ozone therapy a statistically significant reduction of the ulcer area was achieved from median 7.1 (5.6-9.4) cm<sup>2</sup> to 4.4 (3-7) cm<sup>2</sup> (<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.000001), which was on median 38.74 (27.27-51.42)% compared to the baseline values \u200b\u200bbefore the start of the therapy. In 2 patients (3.7%) the ulcers were completely healed. 18 patients (33.3%) achieved a reduction in ulcer area of \u200b\u200bmore than 50% of the baseline value and the remaining 34 patients (63%) also achieved a reduction in ulcer area. A statistically significant in the percentage of surface area was observed in the group of 19 patients suffering from > 5 years of age compared to the group of 35 patients suffering from \u22645 years (median 50 (32.03-67.16)% versus 33.96 (23.71-45); <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.033178), while percentage changes in ulcer surface area did not differ significantly between all other subgroups of patients. There was also a statistically significant reduction in the intensity of pain in VAS scale in all patients, median 6 (5-7) points before treatment versus 4.4 (3-7) points after treatment, <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.000001). Local ozone therapy of venous leg ulcers accelerate the healing process of ulcers in objective planimetric assessment and reduce the intensity of pain ailments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6181-337X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Jan D\u0142ugosz University in Cz\u0119stochowa, Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Angiology and Physical Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Bytom, Poland."}], "LastName": "Pasek", "ForeName": "Jaros\u0142aw", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Osteopathic Medicine, Department of Physiotherapy, Medical University of Mazovia in Warsaw, Warszawa, Poland."}], "LastName": "Szajkowski", "ForeName": "Sebastian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Angiology and Physical Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Bytom, Poland."}], "LastName": "Cie\u015blar", "ForeName": "Grzegorz", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Low Extrem Wounds", "NlmUniqueID": "101128359", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7346"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35637162", "10.1177/15347346221104611"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
