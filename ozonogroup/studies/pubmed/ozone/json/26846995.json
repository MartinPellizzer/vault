Factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to evaluate and optimize the effects of pH, ozone flow rate, and contact time on the treatment process. A Box-Behnken design was successfully applied for modeling and optimizing the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). The results showed that ozonation is an efficient technique for removing diesel from aqueous solution. The determination coefficient (R(2)) was found to be 0.9437, indicating that the proposed model was capable of predicting the removal of TPHs by ozonation. The optimum values of experimental initial pH, degree of O3, and reaction time were 7.0, 1.5, and 35 min, respectively, which could contribute to approximately 60% of TPH removal. This result is in good agreement with the predicted value of 57.28%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
