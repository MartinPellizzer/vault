In this study, we analyzed the relationships among gaseous precursors, secondary aerosols and atmospheric oxidation capacity in Shenzhen, a megacity in the PRD, during the lockdown period in 2020 and the same period in 2021. The comprehensive observational datasets showed large lockdown declines in all primary and secondary pollutants (including O<sub>3</sub>). We found that, however, the daytime concentrations of secondary aerosols during the lockdown period and normal period were rather similar when the corresponding odd oxygen (O<sub>x</sub>\u2261O<sub>3</sub>+NO<sub>2</sub>, an indicator of photochemical processing avoiding the titration effect of O<sub>3</sub> by freshly emitted NO) were at similar levels. Therefore, reduced O<sub>x</sub>, rather than the large reduction in precursors, was a direct driver to achieve the decline in secondary aerosols. Moreover, O<sub>x</sub> was also found to determine the spatial distribution of intercity PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in winter PRD. Thus, an effective strategy for winter PM<sub>2.5</sub> mitigation should emphasize on control of winter O<sub>3</sub> formation in the PRD and other regions with similar conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
