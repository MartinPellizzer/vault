A total of 400 outpatients were randomly divided into two groups: experimental, treated with topical OLEOZON(\u00ae), two times per day and control, treated also two times per day, with ketoconazole cream 2%, for 3 months. A patient was considered cured when the sick nails regained the normal colour, growth and thickness, with a negative mycological study. In the experimental group, a regression of signs was achieved from the first month of treatment, while in the control group, it was obtained after the third month of treatment. All patients treated with OLEOZON(\u00ae) had improvement in their condition (9.5%) or were cured (90.5%). However, in the control group, only 13.5% of patients were cured, 27.5% improved and 59% remained the same, with significant differences between both the groups. After 1 year of follow-up, experimental and control groups presented 2.8% and 44.4% of relapses, respectively. Topical OLEOZON(\u00ae) demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of onychomycosis, superior to that of ketoconazole.
