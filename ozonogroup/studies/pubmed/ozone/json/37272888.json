Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple and efficient detection method for monitoring O<sub>3</sub> in the environment and living cells. In this study, an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) compound was designed and synthesized based on a phenol-type hemicyanine dye and 4-bromo-1-butene, which could specifically detect O<sub>3</sub> in aqueous solution. Due to the ICT process, the absorption spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, and color of the probe hemicyanine-butyl-3-enyl (HCB) changed significantly and thus the rapid and sensitive detection of O<sub>3</sub> was realized. The interaction between O<sub>3</sub> and the probe HCB could be completed within 40 min, and the detection limit of O<sub>3</sub> was as low as 2.15 \u00d7 10<sup>-7</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to the visual detection of O<sub>3</sub> in a simulated O<sub>3</sub> environment and living cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4494-476X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, PR China. wdwu2013@126.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinxiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xinxiang, 453003, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Guo", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, PR China. wdwu2013@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xuehan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, PR China. wdwu2013@126.com."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yinlan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0739-3014"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, PR China. wdwu2013@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pengbo", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, PR China. wdwu2013@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Weidong", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tetramethylene hemicyanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Optical Imaging"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37272888", "10.1039/d3ay00381g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
