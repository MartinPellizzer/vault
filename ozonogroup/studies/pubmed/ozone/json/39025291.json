However, a comprehensive investigation into the three-dimensional (3-D) evolution characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> within complicated urban environments, especially in lake-land environment, is notably scarce. To enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations within a 3-D scale, this study employed an ozone lidar to delineate vertical ozone profiles in Changzhou, a typical city in China with complicated anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and complex land cover. The process analysis tool integrated into the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was further utilized to analyze the formation processes of O<sub>3</sub>. The results unveil a persistent O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode lasting over 15 days in Changzhou during the study period, with multiple peaks exceeding 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m\u207b\u00b3. Notably, O<sub>3</sub> predominantly accumulated within the boundary layer, confined below 1.2\u00a0km. Both ground and vertical contributions to this pollution were mainly due to local chemical reactions, with a maximum near-surface contribution reaching 19\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> and a vertical contribution of 10\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> at the height of 900\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0200\u00a0m. Furthermore, episodes of the enhanced O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on August 9 and August 26, 2021, were influenced by external advection process. Our study also found that local circulation plays an important role in the accumulation of surface O<sub>3</sub> during certain periods. There was a temperature difference between the surface of Lake Tai and the adjacent land, resulting in the formation of lake-land breezes that facilitate the transport of O<sub>3</sub> from the lake surface to the terrestrial environment during pollution events. Our study emphasizes the necessity of reducing local pollutant emissions and implementing joint emission controls as the primary strategies for mitigating O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Changzhou and the surrounding region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
