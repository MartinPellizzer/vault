Ozone was employed to reduce the sheet resistance of conductive film. As a result, the sheet resistance of film was decreased drastically after 1.5 hr ozone (O3) treatment and could reach up to 170 omega/square at 80% T at 550 nm wavelength. In addition, aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) was further applied as an adhesion promoter in order to enhance the adhesion between the SWNTs films and the substrate. Experimental results show that ATPS can greatly improve the adhesion of SWNTs coating to the substrate without the loss of conductivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing 100190, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Mei-Zhen", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21137941", "10.1166/jnn.2010.2785"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
