The chemical oxidants of ozone, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and potassium permanganate may achieve this goal; however, their application in developing countries is sometimes restricted by the complicate operation and high cost. This review paper focuses on the heterogeneous oxidation of As(III) by solid oxidants such as manganese oxide, and the adsorption of As(V) accordingly. Manganese oxide may be prepared by both chemical and biological methods to achieve good oxidation performance towards As(III). Additionally, manganese oxide may be combined with other metal oxides, e.g., iron oxide, to improve the adsorption capability towards As(V). Furthermore, manganese oxide may be coated onto porous materials of metal organic frameworks to develop novel adsorbents for arsenic removal. To achieve the application in engineering works, the adsorbents granulation may be achieved by drying and calcination, agglomeration, and the active components may also be in situ coated onto the porous materials to maintain the oxidation and adsorption activities as much as possible. The novel adsorbents with heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption capability may be carefully designed for the removal of arsenic in household purifiers, community-level decentralized small systems, and the large-scale drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). This review provides insight into the fundamental studies on novel adsorbents, the development of innovative technologies, and the demonstration engineering works involved in the heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption, and may be practically valuable for the arsenic pollution control globally."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
