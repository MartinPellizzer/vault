The aim of this study is to establish an advanced exposure model to predict spatiotemporal changes in fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxides (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations in Shanghai, China. The model is constructed on a geo-statistical modeling framework that incorporates a dimension reduction regression approach and a spatial smoothing function to deal with fine-scale exposure variations. We used a dataset with comprehensive observational and predictor variables that included monitoring data from both national and local agencies from 2013 to 2019, a high-resolution geographical dataset of predictor variables, and a full-coverage weekly satellite data of the aerosol optical depth at a 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 km<sup>2</sup> resolution. Our model performed well in terms of the spatial and temporal prediction ability assessed by cross-validation (CV) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> (spatial R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.89, temporal R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.91), NO<sub>2</sub> (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.49, 0.78), and O<sub>3</sub> (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.67, 0.81) at the national monitors over seven years according to the leave-one-out CV. For the predictions at the local agency monitoring stations, the overall CV R<sup>2</sup> was between 0.77 and 0.89 across the air pollutants. We visualized the long-term and seasonal averaged predictions of the PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2,</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposure on maps with a spatial resolution of 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>. Our study provides a useful tool to accurately estimate air pollution exposure with high spatial and temporal resolution at the urban scale. These model predictions will be useful to assess both short-term and long-term air pollution exposure for health studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
