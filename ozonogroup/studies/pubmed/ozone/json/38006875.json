Several previous reports indicate that over half of supplied nitrous oxide is wasted from leaking manifold-pipeline systems infrastructure prior to patient use, and that remediating leaks can have significant environmental benefits. We describe an accurate, simple and cost-effective cylinder weighing method to quantify nitrous oxide leak from the manifold-pipeline network at our tertiary non-obstetric facility. Nitrous oxide cylinder depletion was prospectively compared with clinical usage derived from the electronic medical record over an 18-day period. A total of 1932\u2009l (3.62\u2009kg) of nitrous oxide was used in 35 operating theatre cases during the period. This was only 16.5% of actual cylinder depletion (11,686\u2009l; 21.88\u2009kg), indicating that 83.5% (9754 l; 18.26\u2009kg) of nitrous oxide had leaked to the atmosphere (376\u2009ml/minute; 22.6\u2009l/hour; 542\u2009l/day). The fraction of nitrous oxide wasted was consistent with a retrospective analysis of the previous 2-year period at the site that compared purchasing records with estimated clinical use. If maintained over a year, the leak would be equivalent to 101 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0009-8177-1643"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["5392"], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Australia."}], "LastName": "Gaff", "ForeName": "Steven J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["5392"], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Australia."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Victor X", "Initials": "VX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["5392"], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia."}], "LastName": "Kayak", "ForeName": "Eugenie", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anaesth Intensive Care", "NlmUniqueID": "0342017", "ISSNLinking": "0310-057X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Operating Rooms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of conflicting interestsThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38006875", "10.1177/0310057X231198123"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
