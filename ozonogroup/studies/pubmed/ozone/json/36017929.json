The use of adjunctive agents and materials-enamel matrix derivatives, low-laser treatment, ozone, locally administered minocycline HCL, doxycycline gels, tetracycline fibers, chlorhexidine chips, granular beta-tricalcium phosphate, and hyaluronic acid, and the like-have been reported to improve pocket depth reduction, periodontal ligament healing, bone defect filling, and mechanical debridement during guided tissue regeneration/flap surgeries. However, the efficacy and benefits of these adjuvants compared to periodontal surgery alone is still widely debated. This evidence-based review critically evaluates and summarizes the efficacy of adjuvants used in periodontal surgery that have been reported in the literature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive and Restorative Dental Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Mohammed Ameen", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive and Restorative Dental Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Sivaraj", "ForeName": "Leela Devi", "Initials": "LD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive and Restorative Dental Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Nahar", "ForeName": "Pragati", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive and Restorative Dental Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Sushuma", "ForeName": "Venkata R", "Initials": "VR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventative and Restorative Dental Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143."}], "LastName": "Prakash", "ForeName": "Meghna", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive and Restorative Dental Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California 94143-0758."}], "LastName": "Vaderhobli", "ForeName": "Ram M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Long Term Eff Med Implants", "NlmUniqueID": "9110830", "ISSNLinking": "1050-6934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36017929", "10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.2022043326", "2cfe86057422e688,654704fb366ed90b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
