In the current study, we exposed cultured human epithelial (HeLa) cells acutely and repeatedly to ozone and investigated the effects thereof on cell viability. The involvement of anti-apoptotic pathways in observed adaptive responses to ozone were investigated by employing the Akt inhibitor (-)-deguelin. Cells were exposed to an ozone-saturated physiological solution using various dosing regimens, including acute exposure and various repetitive exposures. Cell viability was determined with Trypan Blue or MTT tests, or by a DNA-fragmentation (comet) assay. Acute ozone exposure compromised cell membrane integrity severely, while adaptation to reverse an initial reduction in mitochondrial activity was observed. Repetitive, short-duration exposures followed by a single long-duration exposure to ozone furnished a protective adaptation that was reversed by Akt inhibition. Extracellular and intracellular damage (and adaptation) occurs differentially. While acute ozone may decrease cell viability, multiple preexposures up-regulates cellular plasticity via induction of anti-apoptotic pathways in a treatment regimen-specific manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology, North-West University, Potchefstroom, North-West Province, South Africa. tiaan.brink@nwu.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brink", "ForeName": "Christiaan B", "Initials": "CB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pretorius", "ForeName": "Anita", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Niekerk", "ForeName": "Barend P J", "Initials": "BP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliver", "ForeName": "Douglas W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venter", "ForeName": "Daniel P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Redox Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9511366", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03L9OT429T", "NameOfSubstance": "Rotenone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I2ZWO3LS3M", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypan Blue"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K5Z93K66IE", "NameOfSubstance": "deguelin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Rotenone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trypan Blue"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18339251", "10.1179/135100008X259187"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
