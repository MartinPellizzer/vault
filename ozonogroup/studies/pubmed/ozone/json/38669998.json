These two catalysts can spontaneously chemisorb O<sub>3</sub> with zero reaction barrier and have low O<sub>3</sub> conversion barriers (0.31\u00a0eV and 0.19\u00a0eV, respectively). The O<sub>3</sub> decomposition experiment in a continuous flow membrane reactor and electron paramagnetic resonance results verify that Fe@GDY and Co@GDY are efficient catalysts under humid conditions. Raman spectra prove the formation of the key Fe-O/Co-O and FeOO and CoOO intermediates. The hydrophobic nature of graphdiyne and the strongest chemisorption of O<sub>3</sub> among tested ambient gases, make Fe@GDY and Co@GDY ideal catalysts under both dry and humid conditions. These findings would stimulate future explorations on metal anchored GDY-based catalysts for applications of toxic gas decomposition or fixation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
