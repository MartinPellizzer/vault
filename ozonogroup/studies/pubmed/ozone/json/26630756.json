To optimize organic matter removal from this leachate, the combination of two or more techniques is preferred in order to meet stringent effluent standards. In our study, coagulation-flocculation and ozonation are compared as pre- treatment steps for stabilized landfill leachate prior to granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption. The efficiency of the pre treatment techniques is evaluated using COD and UVA254 measurements. For coagulation- flocculation, different chemicals are compared and optimal dosages are determined. After this, iron (III) chloride is selected for subsequent adsorption studies due to its high percentage of COD and UVA254 removal and good sludge settle-ability. Our finding show that ozonation as a single treatment is effective in reducing COD in landfill leachate by 66% compared to coagulation flocculation (33%). Meanwhile, coagulation performs better in UVA254 reduction than ozonation. Subsequent GAC adsorption of ozonated effluent, coagulated effluent and untreated leachate resulted in 77%, 53% and 8% total COD removal respectively (after 6 bed volumes). The effect of the pre-treatment techniques on GAC adsorption properties is evaluated experimentally and mathematically using Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models. Mathematical modelling of the experimental GAC adsorption data shows that ozonation increases the adsorption capacity and break through time with a factor of 2.5 compared to coagulation-flocculation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oloibiri", "ForeName": "Violet", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ufomba", "ForeName": "Innocent", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chys", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Audenaert", "ForeName": "Wim", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Demeestere", "ForeName": "Kristof", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Hulle", "ForeName": "Stijn W H", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Belgium", "MedlineTA": "Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101200320", "ISSNLinking": "1379-1176"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U38V3ZVV3V", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Precipitation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26630756"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
