Their composition is variable. Optimisation of nutrient factors and the effect of some simple stresses on the ability of Cyanothece epiphytica to produce EPS were tested. Of the tested stresses, exposure to ozone for 50\u00a0s at 0.06\u00a0mg/L resulted in a relatively high EPS yield, without any damage to cell structure. EPS was characterised physicochemically. Chemically, it was found to be composed of pentoses arabinose and xylose; hexoses glucose, galactose and mannose; and the deoxyhexose fucose sugars which were sulphated and with different functional groups. EPS from C. epiphytica was found to be a good hydrophobic dispersant, an excellent emulsifier as well as a flocculant. Its potential as a biolubricant with characteristics better than the conventional lubricant 'grease' was revealed through analysis. This study gave the clue for developing a commercial technology to produce a less expensive and more environment-friendly natural lubricant from the cyanobacterium C. epiphytica for tribological applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borah", "ForeName": "Dharitri", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nainamalai", "ForeName": "Sangeetha", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Inter-Disciplinary Research Facility (CIDRF), Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute Campus, Puducherry, 607402, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gopalakrishnan", "ForeName": "Subramanian", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Assam University, Silchar, 788011, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rout", "ForeName": "Jayashree", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alharbi", "ForeName": "Naiyf S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alharbi", "ForeName": "Sulaiman Ali", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, 620024, India. thajuddin@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia. thajuddin@gmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nooruddin", "ForeName": "Thajuddin", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "BT/PR7005/PBD/26/357", "Agency": "Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "ISPP# 0081", "Agency": "International Scientific Partnership Program (ISPP), King Saud University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lubricants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentoses"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides, Bacterial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanothece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Lubricants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pentoses"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides, Bacterial"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29520599", "10.1007/s00253-018-8892-x", "10.1007/s00253-018-8892-x"]}}]}
