Development of new disinfection processes with composite mechanisms is therefore urgently needed. In this study, we employed liquid ground-electrode dielectric barrier discharge (lgDBD) to achieve synergistic sterilization through electric field electroporation and reactive species oxidation. At a voltage of 12 kV, Pseudomonas fluorescens (ultraviolet and ozone-resistant) and Bacillus subtilis (chlorine-resistant) were completely inactivated within 8 and 6 min, respectively, surpassing a 7.0-log reduction. The lgDBD process showed good disinfection performance across a wide range of pH values and different practical water samples. Staining experiments suggest that cellular membrane damage contributes to this inactivation. In addition, we used a two-dimensional parallel streamer solver with kinetics code to fashion a representative model of the basic discharge unit, and discovered the presence of a persistent electric field during the discharge process with a peak value of 2.86 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> V/m. Plasma discharge generates excited state species such as O(<sup>1</sup>D) and N<sub>2</sub>(C<sup>3</sup>\u03a0<sub>u</sub>), and further forms reactive oxygen and nitrogen species at the gas-liquid interface. The physical process, which is driven by electric field-induced cell membrane electroporation, synergizes with the bactericidal effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to provide effective disinfection. Adopting the lgDBD process enhances sterilization efficiency and adaptability, underscoring its potential to revolutionize physicochemical synergistic disinfection practices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
