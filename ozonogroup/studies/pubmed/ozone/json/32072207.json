Although great efforts have been made to determine NO by using o-phenylenediamine (OPD)-based fluorescent probes, more simple and reliable colorimetric assays for detection of NO are extremely scarce because a single OPD structure cannot produce enough optical absorption for chromogenesis. In this study, we report an innovative two-in-one visual colorimetric methodology. Commercially available 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) with two OPD structures in a single molecule is selected as the colorimetric probe, and it reacts with NO via diazo-coupling reaction to generate 1H,3'H-[5,5']bibenzotriazolyl because of the increase of conjugated double bonds, accompanying a distinct color change from colorless to brownish yellow. This two-in-one colorimetric assay can determine NO at a concentration as low as 3\u00a0ppm by the naked eye and 40\u00a0ppb by UV-vis spectrometry, which is the lowest limit of detection (LOD) among reported colorimetric assays for NO. Moreover, the present two-in-one visual colorimetric assay also has good selectivity toward NO over other common potential gas interferents such as CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>. This present study provides a new insight for the design and development of assays for NO.
