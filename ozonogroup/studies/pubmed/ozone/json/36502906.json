Here we assessed the causal effect of long-term (yearly and monthly) exposure to ozone on nocturnal workday sleep time in a national representative sample from the China Family Panel Study, using a difference-in-differences approach. We further followed ninety healthy Chinese young adults four times in four seasons from September 2020 to June 2021, measured their daily sleep architecture using accelerometers, ascertained daily ozone exposure, recorded 5-min eye-closed resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) signals at the last day of each one-week-long measurement session, and explored the effect of ozone exposure on objectively-measured sleep architecture. In the national sample, we found that every 1 interquartile range (IQR) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in yearly and monthly ozone exposure was causally associated with 7.31 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0039) and 4.19 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.040) minutes decline in nocturnal workday sleep time; the dose-response curve represented a quasi-linear pattern with no safety threshold, and plateaued at higher concentrations. In the small-scale study with objectively-measured sleep architecture, we found that every 1 IQR \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the weekly ozone exposure was associated with 5.33\u00a0min decrease in night-time total sleep time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), 1.63 percentage points decrease in sleep efficiency (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 1.99\u00a0min increase in sleep latency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0070), and 5.34\u00a0min increase in wake after sleep onset time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0016) in a quasi-linear pattern. Notably, we found the accumulating trend of ozone exposure on sleep quality during both the short-term and long-term periods. We also found that short-term ozone exposure was associated with altered EEG patterns, mediated by sleep quality. This study indicates that long-term and short-term ozone exposures have negative and accumulating impacts on sleep quality and might impair brain functioning. More hidden health burdens of ozone are worth exploring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
