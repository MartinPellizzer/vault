Studies on VOC emission characteristics have mainly focused on solvent-using and technological sources, while research on the combustion processes of high-energy-consuming industries remains limited. Here, we investigate the emission characteristics of 102 VOC species emitted from eight sources (sintering, pelletizing, steel smelting, a coke oven chimney, the topside of a coke oven, thermal power, and two types of cement kilns) used in four types of high-energy-consuming industries. Our results show significant differences among these sources. The average VOC mass concentrations varied from 0.14 to 7.08\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup>. Alkanes had the highest percentage contribution to VOCs from sintering (45.9%) and thermal power (44.6%), while aromatics had the highest percentage contribution from steel smelting (47.8%) and the topside of the coke oven (52.9%). Alkenes were abundant in the coke oven chimney (49.1%), and oxygenated VOCs accounted for 65.3% of the total VOCs from pelletizing. We also observed notable differences between the two types of cement kilns. In general, ethane, ethene, benzene, propane, acetaldehyde, and chloromethane were the dominant VOC species in all sources. The differences between the sources were due to factors such as the applied raw materials, calcination temperature, and end-of-pipe treatment. By reviewing studies from the past 20\u00a0years, we found that differences in the number of VOC species and the implementation of ultra-low emissions affect VOC emission characteristics. The coke oven chimney and cement kiln chimney-1 had the highest ozone formation potential and secondary organic aerosol potential, respectively. The VOC emissions from coking, iron and steel, thermal power, and cement industries were 1162.1, 289.9, 311.0, and 470.2 Gg, respectively. Our results highlight the need for more effective control measures to minimize VOC emissions from high-energy-consuming industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
