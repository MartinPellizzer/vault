The infrared spectrometer on the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment satellite measured the spectra of smoke particles from the \"Black Summer\" fires in Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, revealing that they contain oxygenated organic functional groups and water adsorption on the surfaces. These injected smoke particles have produced unexpected and extreme perturbations in stratospheric gases beyond any seen in the previous 15 years of measurements, including increases in formaldehyde, chlorine nitrate, chlorine monoxide, and hypochlorous acid and decreases in ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and hydrochloric acid. These perturbations in stratospheric composition have the potential to affect ozone chemistry in unexpected ways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1255-396X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA."}], "LastName": "Bernath", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9041-8299"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Boone", "ForeName": "Chris", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8368-7367"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Crouse", "ForeName": "Jeff", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35298277", "10.1126/science.abm5611"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
