All the experiments were conducted under alkaline conditions to prevent loss of hydrogen cyanide. Results showed that leaching progressed rapidly when the leaching temperature or the initial cyanide concentration was high. The obtained cyanide data in the flask test fitted an inner diffusion process, as described by a shrinking core model. In the batch column test, the cyanide concentration decreased from 44.06 to 9.86\u00a0mg/kg when the leaching intensity was 79\u00a0L/(m<sup>2</sup>\u00a0h) after 23.8\u00a0h leaching. The leaching process for the cyanide compounds was divided into two stages according to the batch column test despite the decrease in the leaching velocity as the cyanide concentration in soil declined. Cyanide removal in the batch column test was better than that in the flask test due to the higher gradient of cyanide concentration. The aqueous solution containing cyanide compounds was decomposed effectively by the hybrid process of ozone and UV rays. Furthermore, the leaching and decomposition of the soil and leaching wastewater were performed with a continuous column test with circulating leaching liquid. The cyanide compounds in the soil and wastewater were removed effectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China. cjg@tust.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Marine Resources and Chemistry, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China. cjg@tust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jingguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Xiaole", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Zezhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zongzheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Huakan Environmental Protection Technology Co.
