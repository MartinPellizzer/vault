The association between air pollutants and AF has remained to be controversial. Thus, in this study, we sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to assess the short- and long-term effects of ambient air pollution on AF.We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid for all related studies up to October 2019. We used the random-effects model to estimate the excess risk percentage (ER%) and confidence intervals (CI) for particulate matter with diameter \u2264 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and \u2264 10 \u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO). Results were further analyzed by subgroups according to location, age, outcome, and gender.In total, 18 studies were included in our meta-analysis: 5 evaluated for long-term effects, 12 for short-term effects, and 1 for both long- and short-term effects. For the short term, ER per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of pollutants was 1.8% (0%-3.7%) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 1.1% (-0.2%-2.4%) for PM<sub>10</sub>; per 10 parts per billion (ppb) increment of gaseous pollutions was 3.2% (0.6%-5.8%) for NO<sub>2</sub>, 2.9% (0.3%-5.7%) for SO<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% (-3.4%-4.7%) for O<sub>3</sub>, and 2.0% (-1.3%-5.4%) for CO per 1000 ppb change. The subgroup analysis showed the short-term effect was significantly different by region, gender, outcome, and age. Meanwhile, in the long term, except for O<sub>3</sub>, a statistically significant association was noted between AF incidence and all pollutants.Our meta-analysis suggests that short-term exposure to part of pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>) increases AF attack. Further, long-term exposure to air pollution can significantly contribute to the incidence of AF in a healthy population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Atrial fibrillation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Miao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Atrial fibrillation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jianqiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Atrial fibrillation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University."}], "LastName": "Zhuo", "ForeName": "Chengui", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Atrial fibrillation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Liangrong", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Int Heart J", "NlmUniqueID": "101244240", "ISSNLinking": "1349-2365"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Atrial Fibrillation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33678796", "10.1536/ihj.20-523"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
