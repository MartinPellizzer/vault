We revisit measurements of ROC species made during two field campaigns in the United States: the 2013 SOAS campaign in forested Centreville, AL, and the 2010 CalNex campaign in urban Pasadena, CA. We find that average measured ROC concentrations are about twice as high in Pasadena (73.8 \u03bcgCsm<sup>-3</sup>) than in Centreville (36.5 \u03bcgCsm<sup>-3</sup>). However, the OH reactivity (OHR) measured at these sites is similar (20.1 and 19.3 s<sup>-1</sup>). The shortfall in OHR when summing up measured contributions is 31%, at Pasadena and 14% at Centreville, suggesting that there may be a larger reservoir of unmeasured ROC at the former site. Estimated O<sub>3</sub> production and SOA potential (defined as concentration \u00d7 yield) are both higher during CalNex than SOAS. This analysis suggests that the ROC in urban California is less reactive, but due to higher concentrations of oxides of nitrogen and hydroxyl radicals, is more efficient in terms of O<sub>3</sub> and SOA production, than in the forested southeastern U.S."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2894-5738"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and
