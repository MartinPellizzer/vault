The initial mixture parabens concentration considered in these experiments was 50\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. The parabens degradation rate was considerably enhanced under neutral pH, specially using a buffered solution, leading to a complete removal under 60\u00a0min and with transferred ozone dose (TOD) 36% lower compared to reaction under natural conditions. Isopropanol, known radical scavenger, impeded the complete contaminants removal, affecting the reaction route and by-products formation, but when KI was jointly added, total removal was achieved under 30\u00a0min and with a TOD of 25.9\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. Parabens depletion was also improved in the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, commonly present in wastewaters. The use of river water (RW) and a secondary wastewater (SWW) as water matrices maintained the process efficiency with lower TOD required, and treated solutions presented lower phytotoxicity towards Lepidium sativum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
