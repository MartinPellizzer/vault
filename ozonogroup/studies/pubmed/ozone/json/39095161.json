Generally, the biological wastewater treatment processes used in wastewater treatment plants have a limited efficiencies of antibiotics resistant bacteria (ARB) disinfection and ARGs degradation and even promote the proliferation of ARGs. Problematically, ARB and ARGs in effluent pose potential risks if they are not further treated. Photocatalytic oxidation is considered a promising disinfection technology, where the photocatalytic process generates many free radicals that enhance the interaction between light and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for ARB elimination and subsequent degradation of ARGs. This review aims to illustrate the progress of photocatalytic oxidation technology for removing antibiotics resistant (AR) from wastewater in recent years. We discuss the sources and transfer of ARGs in wastewater. The overall removal efficiencies of ultraviolet radiation (UV)/chlorination, UV/ozone, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and UV/sulfate-radical based system for ARB and ARGs, as well as the experimental parameters and removal mechanisms, are systematically discussed. The contribution of photocatalytic materials based on TiO<sub>2</sub> and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> to the inactivation of ARB and degradation of ARGs is highlighted, producing many free radicals to attack ARB and ARGs while effectively limiting the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in wastewater. Finally, based on the reviewed studies, future research directions are proposed to realize specific photocatalytic oxidation technology applications and overcome current challenges."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
