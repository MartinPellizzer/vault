This retrospective, ecological study included 20,228 patients with a cardiovascular disease as their primary diagnosis who were examined in the EDs of two Croatian University Hospitals, Sisters of Charity and Holy Spirit, in the study period July 2008-June 2010. The median of daily CVD-related ED visits during the study period was 28 and was the highest during winter. A significant negative correlation was found between CVD-related emergency visits and air temperature measured no more than three days prior to the visit, and the highest negative correlation coefficient was measured two days earlier (R=0.266, p\u22640.001). The number of CVD-related emergency visits significantly correlated with the average NO2 concentration on the same day (R=0.191, p<0.001). The results of multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the number of CVD-related emergency visits depended on air temperature, and NO2 and O3 concentrations. The higher the air temperatures, the lower the number of daily CVD-related emergency visits (p<0.001). An increase in NO2 concentrations (p=0.005) and a decrease in O3 concentrations of two days earlier (p=0.006) led to an increase in CVD-related ED visits. In conclusion, the decrease in O3 concentrations and the increase in NO2, even if below the legally binding thresholds, could be associated with an increase in CVD-related emergency visits and a similar effect was observed with lower temperature measured no more than three days prior to the visit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pintari\u0107", "ForeName": "Sanja", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeljkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Ivan", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pehnec", "ForeName": "Gordana", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nesek", "ForeName": "Vi\u0161nja", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vrsalovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Mislav", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pintari\u0107", "ForeName": "Hrvoje", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Croatia", "MedlineTA": "Arh Hig Rada Toksikol", "NlmUniqueID": "0373100", "ISSNLinking": "0004-1254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Croatia"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Medical Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27749262", "10.1515/aiht-2016-67-2770", "/j/aiht.2016.67.issue-3/aiht-2016-67-2770/aiht-2016-67-2770.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
