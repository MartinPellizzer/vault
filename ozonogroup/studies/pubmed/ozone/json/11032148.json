The TGM network stretches from latitudes 45 degrees N to 50 degrees N. TGM and ozone concentrations (used as complementary pollutant) were presented. The median TGM concentrations throughout the network varied from 1.62 to 1.79 ng/m3. Sites close to Montreal had larger TGM concentrations. Montreal surroundings appeared to be a source of TGM. The TGM concentrations were maximum in wintertime and minimum in summertime throughout the sites. However, the diurnal variations were site specific. St. Anicet and L'Assomption were more variable in terms of large concentrations, whereas Mingan and Villeroy were more variable in terms of low concentrations. Ozone and TGM concentrations were positively correlated at some sites (Villeroy, Mingan and St. Anicet) whereas they were not at L'Assomption (closest site to Montreal). Local TGM and ozone precursor sources would affect the correlation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "laurier.poissant@ec.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poissant", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11032148", "10.1016/s0048-9697(00)00582-9", "S0048-9697(00)00582-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
