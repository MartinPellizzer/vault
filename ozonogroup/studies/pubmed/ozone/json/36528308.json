In this study, we established a novel Non-invasive ACL-Ruptured mouse model without concurrent injuries and elucidated the relationship between OA progression and joint instability.", "We induced the ACL-Rupture non-invasively in twelve-week-old C57BL/6 male mice and evaluated histological, macroscopical, and morphological analysis at 0 days. Next, we created the ACL-R, controlled abnormal tibial translation (CATT), and Sham groups. Then, the joint stability and OA pathophysiology were analyzed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks.", "No intra-articular injuries, except for ACL rupture, were observed in the ACL-R model. ACL-R mice increased anterior tibial displacement compared to the Sham group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, 95% CI [-1.509 to\u00a0-0.966]) and CATT group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, 95% CI [-0.841 to\u00a0-0.298]) at 8 weeks. All mice in the ACL-R group caused cartilage degeneration. The degree of cartilage degeneration in the ACL-R group was higher than in the CATT group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) at 8 weeks. The MMP-3-positive cell rate of chondrocytes increased in the ACL-R group than CATT group from 4 weeks (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043; 95% CI [-28.32 to\u00a0-0.364]) while that of synovial cells increased at 8 weeks (P\u00a0=\u00a00.031; 95% CI [-23.398 to\u00a0-1.021]).", "We successfully established a Non-invasive ACL-R model without intra-articular damage.
