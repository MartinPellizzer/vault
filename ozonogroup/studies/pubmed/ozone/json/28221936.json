These dipper wells are designed to operate under a constant flow of water, which serves both to prevent the accumulation of microorganisms and to aid in the cleanliness of the dipper well itself. Here, a recirculating dipper well ozone sanitation system (DWOSS) was evaluated for the control and inactivation of Escherichia coli , Listeria innocua , PRD1 bacteriophage, and Staphylococcus aureus present on a stainless steel disher. In a low ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) demand medium, the DWOSS achieved over a 5-log reduction for E. coli , L. innocua , and PRD1 at 30 s when exposed to 0.45 to 0.55 ppm of residual O<sub>3</sub>. A greater than 5-log total CFU reduction was achieved for S. aureus at a 600-s exposure time and 0.50 ppm of residual O<sub>3</sub>. When evaluated in the presence of high O<sub>3</sub> demand medium (10% skim milk), the DWOSS performed significantly better (P < 0.05) for all microbe-exposure time combinations compared with a conventional dipper well with respect to the reduction of microbes on the stainless steel disher. For example, at 30 s, the DWOSS achieved 4.37, 2.48, 1.38, and 1.31 greater log (CFU or PFU) reduction of E. coli , L. innocua , PRD1, and S. aureus , respectively, than a conventional dipper well. In addition, the DWOSS was evaluated under two neglect scenarios to determine its ability to control microbes in 10% skim milk medium on the stainless steel disher and within the dipper well basin itself over an extended period of use (2 h of use per day over 5 days). Considering the efficacy of the DWOSS unit against the microbes evaluated here, the integration of ozone into a dipper well could be a potential critical control point to reduce the incidence of microbial contamination during retail food service. To our knowledge, a dipper well with a cleaning-in-place sanitizing system is not currently available for use in the food service industry; and, thus, this is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of a cleaning-in-place dipper well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Center for Food Safety, University of Arkansas, 2650 North Young Avenue, Fayetteville, Arkansas 72704, USA."}], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "Giselle", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Center for Food Safety, University of Arkansas, 2650 North Young Avenue, Fayetteville, Arkansas 72704, USA."}], "LastName": "Gibson", "ForeName": "Kristen E", "Initials": "KE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28221936", "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-055", "S0362-028X(22)09300-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
