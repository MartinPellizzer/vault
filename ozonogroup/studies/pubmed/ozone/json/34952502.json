The FRF was produced in a tube, which was supercooled by a thermoelectric cooling device based on the Peltier effect. The relative humidity (RH) of the air samples varied from 30% to 80% at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and the O<sub>3</sub> concentration was set as 100\u00a0ppbv. Besides O<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> at 150\u00a0ppbv was used for comparison. The density of the FRF was evaluated. Comparison studies on the humidity removal efficiencies and loss ratios of analytes among a FRF HPD, a short Nafion\u2122 tube (NS), and a long Nafion\u2122 tube (NL) HPDs were conducted. As results, the density of the FRF was dependent on the temperature at a fixed sampling flow rate. The outlet humidity of both the FRF and the NL HPDs were less than 8% RH at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The mean concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> after the FRF HPD were similar to the initial concentrations at all humidity levels, whereas they were significantly different for both the NS and NL HPDs at higher humidity. This suggests that the FRF HPD is a reliable humidity pretreatment for O<sub>3</sub> measurements."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
