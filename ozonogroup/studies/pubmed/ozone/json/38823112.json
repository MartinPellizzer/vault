The CH<sub>4</sub> catalytic combustion offers an efficient method for the elimination of CH<sub>4</sub>. However, improving the catalytic performance of Pd-based materials for low-temperature CH<sub>4</sub> combustion remains a big challenge. In this study, we synthesized an enhanced Pd/5NiAlO<sub>x</sub> catalyst that demonstrated superior catalytic activity and improved water resistance compared to the Pd/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst. Specifically, the T<sub>90</sub> was decreased by over 100\u00a0\u00b0C under both dry and wet conditions. Introducing Ni resulted in an enormously enhanced number of oxygen defects on the obtained 5NiAlO<sub>x</sub> support. This defect-rich support facilitates the anchoring of PdO through increased electron transfer, thereby inhibiting the production of high-valence Pd<sup>(2+\u03b4)+</sup> and stimulating the generation of unsaturated Pd sites. Pd<sup>0</sup> can effectively activate surface oxygen and PdO plays a significant role in activating CH<sub>4</sub>, resulting in high activity for Pd/5NiAlO<sub>x</sub>. On the other hand, the increased water resistance of Pd/5NiAlO<sub>x</sub> was mainly due to the generation of *OOH species and the lower accumulation of surface -OH species during the reaction process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
