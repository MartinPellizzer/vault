Upon availability of numerous techniques, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) is the most promising technique for treating industrial wastewater. Higher operating cost is the most promising factor that possess challenge for the industrial scale usage of the AOP process. Combination of biological process with AOP helps in achieving sustainable degradation of toxic pollutant in the wastewater. AOP result in complete or partial degradation of toxic emerging pollutants with the help of free radicals like hydroxyl, superoxide, hydroperoxyl and sulphate radicals. In addition to this the presence of bio-enzymes and microorganisms helps in sustainable degradation of pollutant in an economical and environmentally friendly strategy. In this review, a detailed discussion was conducted on various AOP, focusing on catalytic ozonation, electrochemical oxidation, Sono chemical and photocatalytic processes. With the need for sustainable solutions for wastewater treatment, the use of AOP in conjunction with biological process has innumerous opportunities for not only wastewater treatment but also the production of high value by-products. Further, the effect of AOP combined biological processes needs to be analyzed in real time for the different concentration of industrial wastewater and their benefits needs to be explored in future towards achieving SDGs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
