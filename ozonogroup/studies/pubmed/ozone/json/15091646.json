The experiments were performed at two places, a rural and an urban site in the Po Plain. The data obtained show no significant difference in protein, starch and glucose contents between the treatments; nevertheless, a tendency towards an increase in glucose and a decrease in starch contents was observed in the F chambers compared with NF. In addition, potassium levels were lower in F than in NF treatment, while calcium were higher. Ozone levels observed in the Po Valley are not sufficiently high to cause significant differences in quality parameters of winter wheat."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anguissola Scotti", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Botteschi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091646", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)90006-x", "026974919490006X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
