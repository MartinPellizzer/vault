Prior to this, NMOCs were measured in the central business district using a canister to obtain the 3-hr integrated sample for the 6:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m. period. Such sampling had been carried out annually for nearly a decade at three locations in the New York City metropolitan area. The intent of these measurements, along with measurements of the other ozone precursor, NO(x), was to provide an understanding of ozone formation and the emissions loading and mix in the urban area. The analysis of NMOC and NO(x) measurements shows a downward trend in the case of NMOC. In addition, we compared the canister-based NMOC concentrations with data obtained from the PAMS program for the 6:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m. period. Analysis of the NMOC concentrations reveals poor spatial correlation between the various monitors, reflecting the effect of localized emissions. This suggests that NMOC measurements made at a single location cannot be viewed as representative of the entire region. On the other hand, correlations were found to be higher among the NO(x) monitors, indicating the commonality of emission"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Air Resources, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Albany, New York 12233-3259, USA. gsistla@dec.state.ny.us"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sistla", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zalewsky", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henry", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York City"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15143793", "10.1080/10473289.2002.10470765"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
