The study was designed over a meso-scale (6200 km(2)), carried out in 2010 and repeated in 2012 on a subset of sites. No difference was found between the occurrences of symptoms in relation to soil moisture or plant size. Although no direct significant exposure-response function could be identified, when data were aggregated according to ozone exposure levels the symptoms (in terms of number of symptomatic plants and symptomatic leaves per plant) were found to be significantly more frequent at sites with higher exposure (AOT40>18,000 \u03bcg m(-3) h), especially at high elevations (>700 ma.s.l.). The 2012 results confirmed the 2010 findings. Although ozone levels in the region were almost similar between 2010 and 2012, symptoms were significantly less frequent in 2012. This was likely due to drier conditions in 2012 (+1.1 \u00b0C; -23% precipitation), a situation that may have prevented in part ozone uptake and therefore the expression of symptoms. These results are useful in several respects: (i) for identifying areas where ozone is likely to impact vegetation; (ii) for testing the appropriateness of EU standards to protect vegetation from ozone; and (iii) for designing biomonitoring surveys. We suggest that V. lantana is a suitable indicator for assessing qualitatively (but not quantitatively) the potential risk of ozone damage to vegetation over remote, large areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.
