The experimental results showed that after continuous operation for one year BAC filter still maintained a removal of 15 approximately 20% for COD(Mn) and 20 approximately 30% of removal for UV(254). Correlative analysis based on lots of data found that empty bed contact time (EBCT) instead of flow rate could obviously impact on removal effect of micro-pollutants in BAC filter. And the optimal relationship between EBCT and removal effect of micro-pollutants for BAC filter was logarithm. On the other hand, long term running of BAC filter proved that there was a good removal of chloroform formation potential, but the removal of brominated trihalomethane formation potential decline with further bromization, even there appeared to be formation of bromoform in BAC filter."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) IWA Publishing 2008."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Tianjin Polytechnic University, No. 63 Chenglin Road, Hedong District, Tianjin 300160, Republic of China. zzh7448@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Z H", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18725738", "10.2166/wst.2008.441"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
