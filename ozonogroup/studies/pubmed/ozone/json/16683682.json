Its bactericide, virucide, and fungicide effects are based on its strong oxidation effect with the formation of free radicals as well as its direct destruction of almost all microorganisms. In addition, ozone has a therapeutic effect that facilitates wound healing and improves the supply of blood. For medical purposes, ozone may be applied as a gas or dissolved in water. Despite the advantages that the therapeutic use of ozone offers, reservations remain in terms of its application in the oral and maxillofacial area. Particularly, the gaseous application of ozone is critically evaluated because of its possible side effects on the respiratory system. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the current applications of ozone in dentistry and oral surgery. Research was based on peer-reviewed sources found through a Medline/PubMed search and other textbooks, reviews, and journals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Clinic for Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Cranio- and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. sstuebinger@uhbs.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "St\u00fcbinger", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sader", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Filippi", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Quintessence Int", "NlmUniqueID": "0342677", "ISSNLinking": "0033-6572"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oral Surgical Procedures"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}], "NumberOfReferences": "88"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16683682", "839670"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
