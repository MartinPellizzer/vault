Traditional disinfection methods to reduce pathogens concentration (e.g., chlorination, ozonation, UV) are expensive, unsafe, and/or sometimes ineffective, highlighting the need for new disinfection technologies. The promising results of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) treatment to eradicate microorganisms suggest the efficacy of this treatment to improve WW quality. This work aimed to assess if PDI can be successfully extended to real contexts for the microbial inactivation in WW. For the first time, PDI experiments with 9 different water matrices compositions were performed to inquire about the influence of some of their physicochemical parameters on the effectiveness of microbial inactivation. Bacterial photoinactivation was tested in freshwater, aquaculture water, and seawater samples, as well as in influents and effluents samples from domestic, industrial, and a mixture of industrial and domestic WW receiving wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Additionally, PDI assays were performed in phosphate-buffered saline isotonic solution (PBS), used as an aqueous comparative matrix. To relate the PDI disinfection efficiency with the physicochemical compositions of the different used water matrices, a series of statistical analysis were performed, in order to support our main conclusions. Overall, the results showed that PDI is an effective and promising alternative to traditionally used WW disinfection methods, with a bacterial reduction of >3.0 log CFU/mL in all the water matrices within the first hour of PDI treatment, but also that the physicochemical composition of the aqueous matrices to be PDI-disinfected must be taken into account since they seem to influence the PDI efficacy, namely the pH, with acidic pH conditions seeming to be associated to a better PDI performance in general."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
