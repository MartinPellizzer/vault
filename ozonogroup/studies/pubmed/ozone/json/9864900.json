The APHEA project (Air Pollution on Health: a European Approach) analyzes the short-term effects in 15 european cities. We evaluated the acute relation between air pollution, mortality, and hospital emergency-room visits in Barcelona, one of the cities participating in the APHEA project.", "Daily variations in total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and emergency-room visits for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma were studied in relation to daily variations in air pollution levels in 1985-1991. Poisson regression was done and temperature, relative humidity, and epidemics of asthma and flu were controlled. Temporal trends and auto-regressive terms were examined.", "A reduction of about 50 micrograms/m3 in particles and sulfur dioxide was accompanied by a reduction of about 4% and 6% (p < 0.05), respectively, in daily deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular causes and emergency-room visits for COPD. Oxidant pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and ozone) were related positively with cardiovascular mortality and emergency visits for COPD and asthma. The role of ozone was notable, with a reduction in ozone levels of 50 micrograms/m3 originating a 4% reduction in emergency-room visits for COPD and asthma (p < 0.05).", "Current levels of air pollutants had an epidemiologically measurable impact on mortality and emergency-room visits in Barcelona. These results were consistent with the findings of similar studies in other european and american cities and with previous studies of emergency-room admissions in Barcelona. These studies suggest the possible toxicity of air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unitat de Recerca Respirat\u00f2ria i Ambiental, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tob\u00edas Garc\u00e9s", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sunyer Deu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castellsagu\u00e9 Piqu\u00e9", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1ez Zafra", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ant\u00f3 Boqu\u00e9", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Impacto de la contaminaci\u00f3n atmosf\u00e9rica sobre la mortalidad y las urgencias por enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cr\u00f3nica y asma en Barcelona."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Gac Sanit", "NlmUniqueID": "8901623", "ISSNLinking": "0213-9111"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Gac Sanit. 1999 Mar-Apr;13(2):167-8. doi: 10.1016/s0213-9111(99)71343-9", "PMID": "10447394"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cause of Death"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases, Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9864900", "10.1016/s0213-9111(98)76476-3", "S0213-9111(98)76476-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
