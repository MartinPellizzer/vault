Unlike for other commodity crops, the risk of air pollution, specifically ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), to this C<sub>4</sub> crop has not yet been quantified. Yet, recent work has highlighted both the potential risks of O<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> bioenergy crops, and the emergence of O<sub>3</sub> exposure across the tropics as a vital factor determining global food security. Given the large extent, and planned expansion of sugarcane production in places like Brazil to meet global demand for biofuels, there is a pressing need to characterize the risk of O<sub>3</sub> to the industry. In this study, we sought to a) derive sugarcane O<sub>3</sub> dose-response functions across a range of realistic O<sub>3</sub> exposure and b) model the implications of this across a globally important production area. We found a significant impact of O<sub>3</sub> on biomass allocation (especially to leaves) and production across a range of sugarcane genotypes, including two commercially relevant varieties (e.g. CTC4, Q240). Using these data, we calculated dose-response functions for sugarcane and combined them with hourly O<sub>3</sub> exposure across south-central Brazil derived from the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) to simulate the current regional impact of O<sub>3</sub> on sugarcane production using a dynamic global vegetation model (JULES vn 5.6). We found that between 5.6\u00a0% and 18.3\u00a0% of total crop productivity is likely lost across the region due to the direct impacts of current O<sub>3</sub> exposure. However, impacts depended critically on the substantial differences in O<sub>3</sub> susceptibility observed among sugarcane genotypes and how these were implemented in the model. Our work highlights not only the urgent need to fully elucidate the impacts of O<sub>3</sub> in this important bioenergetic crop, but the potential implications air quality may have upon tropical food production more generally."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
