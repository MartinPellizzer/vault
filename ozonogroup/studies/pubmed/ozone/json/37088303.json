While studies suggest pollutant exposure alters insulin signaling in certain tissues, there is a lack of comparison across multiple tissues needed for a holistic assessment of metabolic effects, and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Air pollution increases plasma levels of glucocorticoids, systemic regulators of metabolic function. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine effects of ozone on insulin-signaling genes in major metabolic tissues, and 2) elucidate the role of glucocorticoids. Male Fischer-344 rats were treated with metyrapone, a glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, and exposed to 0.8\u00a0ppm ozone or clean air for 4\u00a0h, with tissue collected immediately or 24\u00a0h post exposure. Ozone inhalation resulted in distinct mRNA profiles in the liver, brown adipose, white adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, including effects on insulin-signaling cascade genes (Pik3r1, Irs1, Irs2) and targets involved in glucose metabolism (Hk2, Pgk1, Slc2a1), cell survival (Bcl2l1), and genes associated with diabetes and obesity (Serpine1, Retn, Lep). Glucocorticoid-dependent regulation was observed in the liver and brown and white adipose tissues, while effects in skeletal muscle were largely unaffected by metyrapone treatment. Gene expression changes were accompanied by altered phosphorylation states of insulin-signaling proteins (BAD, GSK, IR-\u03b2, IRS-1) in the liver. The results show that systemic effects of ozone inhalation include tissue-specific regulation of insulin-signaling pathway genes via both glucocorticoid-dependent and independent mechanisms, providing insight into mechanisms underlying adverse effects of pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
