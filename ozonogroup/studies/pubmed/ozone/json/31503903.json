The concurrent measurement of these complementary trace species in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere allows inferring exchange processes in the tropopause region. Whereas an advanced <i>H</i><sub>2</sub><i>O</i> differential absorption lidar at 935 nm has successfully been developed and extensively tested at DLR in the past, we describe here an amendment of this lidar by the addition of an ultraviolet (UV) channel to measure ozone. The transmitter of the ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is based on a near-IR optical parametric oscillator that is frequency-converted into the UV spectral range by intracavity sum frequency mixing. Hereby, a continuous UV tuning range of \u223c297<i>-</i>317\u2009\u2009<i>nm</i> has been achieved. The average output power in this range is higher than 1 W corresponding to more than 10 mJ per pulse at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. The ozone DIAL system has been carefully characterized both on the ground and in flight. The first simultaneously measured two-dimensional cross-sections of ozone and water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere have been recorded during the Wave-driven Isentropic Exchange (WISE) field campaign in 2017 demonstrating the high potential of this system for studying exchange processes in this region of the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fix", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steinebach", "ForeName": "Felix", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wirth", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00e4fler", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ehret", "ForeName": "Gerhard", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31503903", "10.1364/AO.58.005892", "415657"]}}]}
