To break through the bottleneck of uncomplete MC-LR degradation by conventional physical-chemistry methods, Fenton-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) developed rapidly due to striking degradation efficiency through the potent hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b7) oxidation. Herein, a comprehensive overview is presented on the recent achievements of the various Fenton-based technologies (including conventional Fenton, photo-Fenton, electro-Fenton, ozone-Fenton and sono-Fenton) for MC-LR degradation. In particular, the comparisons between various Fenton-based technologies about advantages and drawbacks are discussed. Based on analyzing the degradation intermediates and pathways, the destruction of Adda chain via hydroxylation was confirmed to be essential for detoxification of MC-LR. Roles of influencing factors such as MC-LR initial concentration, dosages of the catalyst and oxidant, environment alkalinity, natural organic matters (NOMs) as well as other inorganic ions are specifically summarized. This Review also gave special emphasis on technique optimization trends for Fenton application of MC-LR degradation, as well as key challenges and future opportunities in this fast developing field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
