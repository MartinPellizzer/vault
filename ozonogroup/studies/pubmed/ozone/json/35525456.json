DCV control programs were periodically applied in three phases starting from 2007, 2010 and 2014. It was found that NO and NO<sub>2</sub> levels decreased during the study period but more dramatically after the implementation of DCV Phase III than pre-DCV Phase III. Source apportionment analysis confirmed that the ambient NO and NO<sub>2</sub> in Hong Kong attributed to the regulated DCV emissions in Phase III reduced at rates of 5.1-14.4\u00a0ppbv/yr in roadside environment and 1.6-3.1\u00a0ppbv/yr in suburban area. Despite overall NO<sub>x</sub> reduction, increased NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub>x</sub> ratios were recorded during the study period possibly due to the application of diesel particulate filter (DPF) in DCVs. However, after introducing DCV Phase III, observed O<sub>3</sub> values experienced more dramatic increasing trends in most areas of Hong Kong than pre-DCV Phase III. Model simulations revealed that O<sub>3</sub> production rate kept increasing and turned to be less sensitive to NO<sub>x</sub> from 2014 to 2019. On the roadside, net O<sub>3</sub> production rate was more than doubled during 2014-2019 owing to NO<sub>x</sub> reduction. Moreover, the levels of oxidants (OH, HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub>) were 1.5-5 times those before 2014. In suburban environment, NO<sub>x</sub> reduction also facilitated O<sub>3</sub> production and radical cycling, but made smaller contributions than those on the roadside during 2014-2019. This study unraveled that NO<sub>x</sub> reductions benefited from DCV regulations caused increase in surface O<sub>3</sub> and fueled O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry in various environments. More stringent control measures on emissions of VOCs, especially those with high OH reactivity, might help to better mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
