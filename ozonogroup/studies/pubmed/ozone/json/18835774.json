The WWTP was composed of two coagulation-flocculation units and a biological unit and generated around of 6550 kg/d of sludge. Ozone was applied to sludge coming from flotation units (110 g TSS/L) at doses up to 0.03 g O(3)/g TSS during batch tests, no solids solubilization being observed. Ozone doses ranging from 0.007 to 0.02 g O(3)/g TSS were also applied to the raw wastewater in a bubble column reaching a 6.8% of TSS removal for the highest ozone dose. Finally, the effect of the pre-ozonation (0.05 g O(3)/g TSS) of wastewater coming from the first flotation unit was tested in two activated sludge systems during 70 days. Ozonation caused a reduction of the observed yield coefficient of biomass from 0.14 to 0.07g TSS/g COD(Tremoved) and a slight improvement of COD removal efficiencies. On the basis of the capacity for ozone production available in the industry, a maximum reduction of sludge generated by the WWTP of 7.5% could be expected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. joseluis.campos@usc.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campos", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Otero", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Franco", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mosquera-Corral", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roca", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioresour Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9889523", "ISSNLinking": "0960-8524"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Food Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seafood"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18835774", "10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.056", "S0960-8524(08)00672-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
