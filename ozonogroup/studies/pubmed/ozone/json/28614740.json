It is also reported to be persistent to various water treatment techniques. Although there are some studies on removal of sucralose by advanced oxidation process, limited information, in terms of reaction kinetics, transformation products and degradation pathway etc., was reported in its ozonation process. In this study, the reaction kinetics, removal efficiency, influence of pH, humic acid and carbonate on sucralose degradation by ozone, have been studied systematically. The results demonstrated that ozonation of sucralose was initiated by the formation of OH radical. Sucralose could be completely removed with excess O<sub>3</sub> at neutral and basic conditions in ultrapure water. The rate of degradation decreased significantly in acidic condition and in the presence of carbonate and OH radical scavenger (e.g. tert-butanol). The acidity was the key factor affecting the degradation of sucralose. The rate constant was about 500 times higher at pH7 than that at pH4. Transformation products study indicated that the ozonation of sucralose were more complex than that in photolysis reaction. Although ozonation of sucralose was initiated by OH radical, both OH radical and O<sub>3</sub> might be involved in the formation of transformation products and total organic carbon (TOC) removal. Various transformation products, such as aldehydes, carboxylic acids and probable chloride containing products, were identified and characterized in details. An ozonation degradation pathway of sucralose was proposed as well."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
