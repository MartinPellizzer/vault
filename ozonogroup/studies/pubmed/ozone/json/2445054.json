Both the number and functional reactivity are affected, with evidence of blastic transformation in T cell but not B cell areas of the nodes. In the present work we determine the extent that modulation of a possible product of immune system activation, interferon, is capable of influencing the way that experimental animals respond to zone. Outbred CD-1 mice were treated with an interferon inducer, poly I:C, or with an anti-interferon antibody while being exposed to ozone at a concentration of 0.7 or 0.9 ppm for 20 h per day for 4 days. Interferon induction produced a significant reduction in lesion volumes in both exposure groups, while anti-interferon produced the opposite effect. Less alveolar damage was observed in interferon-induced, ozone-exposed animals than in animals exposed to ozone alone. In contrast, anti-interferon-treated, ozone-exposed animals showed larger lesions which extended to more peripheral structures and were more extensively infiltrated with neutrophilic leukocytes. These results show that interferon induction protects against zone-mediated lung damage. They also suggest that cells are activated during ozone inhalation which mitigate the effects of ozone on the lung by secretion of interferon."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Science Department, GM Tech Center, Warren, MI 48090-9055."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dziedzic", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9008-11-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O84C90HH2L", "NameOfSubstance": "Poly I-C"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Interferons"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Poly I-C"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2445054", "10.1016/0378-4274(87)90256-6", "0378-4274(87)90256-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
