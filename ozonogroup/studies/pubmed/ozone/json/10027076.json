Biologic and biochemical properties associated with CCSP have led to speculation that it participates in pulmonary inflammatory control. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that CCSP-deficient mice are more sensitive to either hyperoxia or ozone toxicity and show altered oxidant-induced pulmonary proinflammatory responses. In this study we test the hypothesis that altered chemokine responses seen in CCSP-/- mice following oxidant stress are a direct consequence of altered immunoregulation associated with CCSP deficiency. To test this hypothesis we utilized three distinct models of inducing pulmonary toxicity: hyperoxia and ozone (O3), which cause epithelial cell injury, and endotoxin, which causes pulmonary inflammation independent of direct epithelial cell injury. Wild-type (WT) or CCSP-/- strain 129 mice were exposed to O3 at 1.0 ppm for 24 hours, oxygen (O2) > 99% for 68 hours or inhalation of 0.0575 microgram endotoxin per mouse for 10 minutes and examined 6 hours postexposure. Mice displayed increased sensitivity to O3, as demonstrated by increased abundance of mRNAs encoding Eotaxin, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, and MIP-2, after 4 hours of exposure, whereas WT mice were unaltered from controls. Increased sensitivity to hyperoxia was also observed, as demonstrated by increased abundance of mRNAs encoding Eotaxin, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, MIP-2, and interferon-gamma inducible (IP)-10 after 68 hours of exposure, whereas WT mice were unaltered from controls. In contrast, WT and CCSP-/- mice responded identically 6 hours postinhalation of 0.0575 microgram lipopolysaccharide (LPS) per mouse. PMN response was 63% and 64% in WT and CCSP-/- mice, respectively. Messenger RNAs encoding Eotaxin, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, MIP-2, IP-10, and MCP-1 were increased identically. We conclude that CCSP does not participate in regulation of the endotoxin-elicited pulmonary inflammatory response. Identical inflammatory and chemokine responses of CCSP-/- and WT mice in response to a nonepithelial toxic agent (endotoxin) suggest that altered inflammatory control observed between WT and CCSP-/- mice following O2 and O3 exposure is not the result of altered immunoregulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester, NY 14642, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finkelstein", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oberd\u00f6rster", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reynolds", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stripp", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ESO1247", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ESO8964", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL51376", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Scgb1a1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9060-09-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Uteroglobin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Chemokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Knockout"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uteroglobin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10027076", "10.1080/019021499270394"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
