The UVA-LED/PI AOP remarkably enhanced the degradation of NPX and seven other selected micropollutants with the observed pseudo-first-order rate constants ranging from 0.069 \u00b1 0.001 to 4.50 \u00b1 0.145 min<sup>-1</sup> at pH 7.0, demonstrating a broad-spectrum micropollutant degradation ability. Lines of evidence from experimental analysis and kinetic modeling confirmed that hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were the dominant species generated in UVA-LED/PI AOP, and they contributed evenly to NPX degradation. Increasing the pH and irradiation wavelength negatively affected NPX degradation, and this could be well explained by the decreased quantum yield (\u03a6<sub>PI</sub>) of PI. The degradation kinetics of NPX by the UVA-LED/PI AOP in the presence of water matrices (i.e., chloride, bicarbonate, and humic acid) and in real waters were examined, and the underlying mechanisms were illustrated. A total of nine transformation products were identified from NPX oxidation by the UVA-LED/PI AOP, mainly via hydroxylation, dealkylation, and oxidation pathways. The UVA-LED/PI AOP proposed might be a promising technology for the treatment of micropollutants in aqueous solutions. The pivotal role of \u03a6<sub>PI</sub> during light photolysis of PI may guide the future design of light-assisted PI AOPs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Interdisciplinary Institute of Environment and Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Zhu Hai519087, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9443-6790"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology and Health Science, Wuyi University, Jiangmen529020, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology and Health Science, Wuyi University, Jiangmen529020, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Ge", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology and Health Science, Wuyi University, Jiangmen529020, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Linqian", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for City Cluster Environmental Safety and Green Development of the Ministry of Education, School of Ecology, Environment and Resources, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou510006, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0333-3727"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Interdisciplinary Institute of Environment and Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Zhu Hai519087, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ao", "ForeName": "Zhimin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0903-5547"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin150090, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B45A1BUM4Q", "NameOfSubstance": "metaperiodate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36745772", "10.1021/acs.est.2c06414"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
