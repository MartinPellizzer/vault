They were divided into three groups according to whether the mental nerve of the left mandible was injured and NCP was applied or not: group 1 (n=3) (non-mental nerve damage, non-MD) - the left mental nerve was exposed and non-damaged; group 2 (n=3) (mental nerve damage, MD) - the left mental nerve was exposed and damaged, NCP was not applied; and group 3 (n=4) (mental nerve damage and NCP, MD-NCP) - the left mental nerve was exposed and damaged, NCP was applied with regular intervals (three times a week). <b>Results:</b> For the behavior analysis, von Frey test was used. Furthermore, the nerve tissues were examined with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the extent of neurorecovery was evaluated with the immunofluorescence staining of certain markers. The behavioral analysis showed that the function recovery sensory nerve was faster in group 3 (MD-NCP). In the histomorphologic and immunofluorescence analyses, the expression of the factors involved in neurorecovery was much higher in group 3 than in group 2 (MD). <b>Conclusions:</b> The expeditious recovery of sensory nerve function as well as the higher expression of the factors indicating nerve function recovery in the NCP-treated group suggest that NCP has a positive effect on regeneration after sensory nerve crushing injury. Therefore, in the case of sensory impairment of the oral-maxillofacial region, no-ozone cold plasma can be applied for therapeutic effect."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental and Life Science Institute, Dental School, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Si-Yeon", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental and Life Science Institute, Dental School, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Jaiswal", "ForeName": "M Shriya", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental and Life Science Institute, Dental School, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Yoon-Seo", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Development, FEAGLE Corporations, 70\u20116, Jeungsan\u2011ro, Mulgeum\u2011eup, Yangsan\u2011si, Gyeongsangnam\u2011do 50614, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Jeong-Hae", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Dental Science, School of Dentistry, Pusan National University, Beomeo-ri, Mulgeum-eup, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 50612, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Gyoo-Cheon", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, School of Korean Medicine, Yangsan Campus of Pusan National University, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 50612, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Jin-Woo", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental and Life Science Institute, Dental School, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental Research Institute, Pusan National University Dental Hospital, Yangsan, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Dae-Seok", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101213954", "ISSNLinking": "1449-1907"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Sciatic Nerve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mandibular Nerve Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crush Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Peripheral Nerve Injuries"}], "CoiStatement": "Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ziccardi VB, Assael LA.
