Karst.), grown on two soils, were from July 1986 to September 1987 exposed to ozone fumigation (50 microg m(-3) as a control, 100 microg m(-3) plus peaks between 130 and 360 microg m(-3) as treatment) and acid mist of pH 3.0 (versus mist pH 5.6 in the control). Climatic conditions, identical for both control and treatment, followed a diurnal and seasonal pattern characteristic of medium high altitudes of the Bavarian Forest, an area affected by the new-type forest decline. Gas-exchange measurements were carried out on the plants from December 1986 until the end of the 14-month's exposure using a series of climate-controlled minicuvettes. ANOVA of the four clones investigated towards the end of the experiment gave hints of a treatment-related depression of the photosynthetic capacity of the previous year's needles (age-class 1986). Within this age-class only one of the clones (11) showed a significant treatment effect, indicating an age-class dependence and a genetic influence of the treatment-related depression of the photosynthetic capacity. The current year's flush was not impaired through the ozone and acid mist exposure. Analysis also revealed clear effects of soil, clone and needle age on photosynthetic parameters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Botanik II der Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Mittlerer Dallenbergweg 64, 8700 Wuerzburg, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "F\u00fchrer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dunkl", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knoppik", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selinger", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blank", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Payer", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lange", "ForeName": "O L", "Initials": "OL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092285", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90051-d", "0269-7491(90)90051-D"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
