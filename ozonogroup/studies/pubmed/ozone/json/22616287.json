The biofilter consists of four segments connected in series, each with a packing layer made of polyvinyl formal. The influent airstreams including toluene vapors were passed through segments 1-3 as up-flow with a toluene concentration of 0.9-1.2 g m(-3) and with an empty-bed retention time of 26-52 sec. Nutrient solutions were fed to all packed segments once a day by means of immersion. The nutrient solution was used repeatedly and replenished by the addition of (NH4)2SO4. The result at 155 days showed nitrogen depletion was particularly obvious and the lack of nitrogen affected toluene removal. By adding 161 g of nitrogen solution per volumetric cubic meter of reactor, toluene removal efficiency was immediately increased to greater than 99%. With long-term biofilter operation, 21%-32% of ammonium was utilized for nitrification because of the growth of nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrosomonas sp. Based on the carbon-nitrogen balance, the daily nitrogen demand for toluene removal was estimated 2.1 g day(-1) at a toluene load of 70 g m(-3) hr(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Integrated Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "Yasutaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okunishi", "ForeName": "Suguru", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higuchi", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakajima", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22616287", "10.1080/10962247.2012.658953"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
