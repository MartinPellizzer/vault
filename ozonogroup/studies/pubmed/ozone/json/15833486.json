High ozone levels, close to the thresholds for human health and clearly above the threshold for the protection of plants and ecosystems, were observed in Volos. O3 levels in Volos were higher than those in Patras. NOx levels in Patras were significantly higher than the limits for human health and plants' protection. Both, NOx and SO2 levels were higher in Patras than in Volos. The Patras' harbor high traffic seems to drive the diurnal pattern of SO2 in that city. The examination of the rate of ozone accumulation, during the high O3 period (Apr.-Sep.), revealed the occurrence of two phases, a fast and a slow one, with different durations in each city. We suggest that the occurrence of such two phases' patterns should be considered in relevant ozone studies. In both towns, the O3 levels were higher during weekends in comparison to midweek days, although NO levels were lower. Our results support the hypothesis that the weekend O3 effect is due to a combination of VOC sensitivity of the studied areas and the reduced NOx emissions during weekends. Based on the comparison of the weekend effect in the two cities, we suggest the occurrence of a feedback mechanism between peri-urban natural ecosystems (forests) and the polluting anthropogenic ones (cities)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Crop Science, Agricultural University of Athens, Iera Odos 75, Botanikos, Athens 11855, Greece. ceep2kaa@aua.gr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riga-Karandinos", "ForeName": "Antonia-Nelly", "Initials": "AN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saitanis", "ForeName": "Constantine", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15833486", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.11.059", "S0045-6535(04)01134-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
