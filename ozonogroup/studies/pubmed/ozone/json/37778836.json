The concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were under the acceptable level, while both PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> were higher than the safe levels as prescribed by national and international air quality standards. The results depict that 21% of the total observation days were found to be complex polluted days (PM<sub>2.5</sub> > 35 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> and O<sub>3</sub> > 160 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>). The secondary HCHO was used for accurate analysis of O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity. A difference of 11.40% and 10% during March-April 2018 and September-October 2019 respectively in O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity was found between HCHO<sub>total</sub>/NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO<sub>sec</sub>/NO<sub>2</sub>. The results indicate that primary HCHO have significant contribution in HCHO. O<sub>3</sub> formation predominantly remained to be in VOC-limited and transitional regime during March-April 2018 and September-October 2019 in Dongying. These results imply that concurrent control of both NOx and VOCs would benefit in ozone reductions. Additionally, the criteria pollutants (PM, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>) depicted strong correlations with each other except for O<sub>3</sub> for which weak correlation coefficient was obtained with all the species. This study will prove to be baseline for designing of air pollution control strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
