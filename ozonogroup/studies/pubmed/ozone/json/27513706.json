Time-series analysis and case-crossover analysis were used to assess the short-term effects of air pollution on asthma hospitalizations. For the time-series analysis, generalized log-linear quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regressions were used to assess the relationships, controlling for seasonality and long-term trends using flexible spline functions. For the case-crossover analysis, conditional logistic regression was used to compute the effect estimates with time-stratified referent selection strategies.", "A total of 36,024 asthma admissions were considered. Findings indicated that the largest effects on asthma admissions related to PM<sub>2.5</sub> , NO<sub>2</sub> , PM<sub>10</sub> and pollen were found in the cool season for children (0-17 years), with the 5-day cumulative effects of 30.2% (95% CI: 13.4-49.6%), 12.5% (95% CI: 6.6-18.7%), 8.3% (95% CI: 2.5-14.4%) and 4.2% (95% CI: 2.2-6.1%) increases in risk of asthma hospital admissions per 10 unit increments, respectively.
