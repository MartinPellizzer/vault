These studies suggest that the elderly and those with certain genetic polymorphisms are susceptible to adverse air pollution-associated health events.", "We hypothesize that physiological responses to air pollutants vary with age and are genetically influenced.", "To test this hypothesis, we exposed mice from three inbred strains (C57BL/6J, B6; C3H/HeJ, HeJ; C3H/HeOuJ, OuJ) to ozone (O(3)) and carbon black (CB) at two ages, (5 months, 12 months), for 3 consecutive days, to either filtered air (FA), CB particles, or O(3) and CB sequentially (O(3)CB) (CB, 550 \u00b5g/m(3); O(3), 600 ppb). Heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), breathing, and core temperature (Tco) responses were analyzed.", "We observed time-dependent physiological changes in response to O(3)CB exposure in each strain, relative to FA exposure for both age groups. Each mouse strain showed distinct adaptation profiles to repeated acute exposures to O(3). In younger mice, several time-dependent effects (decreased HR and increased HRV) were prominent in HeJ and OuJ mice but not B6 mice. We also observed variability in adaptation in older mice. However, responses in older mice were generally attenuated when compared to the younger mice. In addition, cardiac-respiratory interactions were affected with CB and O(3)CB exposures albeit with patterns differing by age or exposure.", "Our results suggest that age considerably attenuates physiological responses to O(3) and O(3)CB exposures. Age-related physiological changes such as increased oxidative stress in mouse tissue may be involved in this attenuation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gradient, Cambridge, MA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamade", "ForeName": "Ali K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "Vikas", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rabold", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tankersley", "ForeName": "Clarke G", "Initials": "CG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AG-21057", "Acronym": "AG", "Agency": "NIA NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20883109", "10.3109/08958378.2010.503974"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
