This UVR is associated with problems such as sunburn, photoaging, cataracts, and skin cancer. In the United States, skin cancer is among the top three reported cancers, and its incidence is increasing rapidly. Physicians agree that human exposure to UVR should be controlled by protecting the skin or limiting its exposure to UVR. As military physicians, our mission is to protect the fighting force and educate the command on the best possible course of action to accomplish this mission. In this paper, I quantitatively demonstrate that wearing the inventoried sun, woodland, type III cover is a far superior course of action when a commander desires a UVR counter measure for the fighting force."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USAMH, Heidelberg, Germany APO/AE 09042."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schissel", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Mil Med", "NlmUniqueID": "2984771R", "ISSNLinking": "0026-4075"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Head Protective Devices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Military Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Protection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11569441"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
