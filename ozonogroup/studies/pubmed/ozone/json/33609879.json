Light absorption and fluorescence of BrC fraction extracted from fresh and ozonized propane soot particles by methanol were systematically measured, which showed that (1) the mass absorption efficiencies (MAE) sharply decreased by ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) aging (e.g., 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3-0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> for MAE<sub>365</sub>), but changed slowly with increased O<sub>3</sub> concentration (e.g., from 0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2-0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> for MAE<sub>365</sub>); (2) the fluorescence emission peaks were blue shifted, implying a loss of conjugated structures; (3) excitation-emission matrix analysis suggested that humic-like substances, charge transfer complexes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-like substances were the main chromophores. The PAH loss, accompanied by the decline of surface C\u02edC content, contributed more to the change of optical properties than the oxygenated PAH formation, thereby leading to the decrease in light absorption and fluorescence with O<sub>3</sub> aging. This research reveals the importance of identifying the components responsible for optical properties in investigating the evolution of BrC during atmospheric aging, and is benefit for improving the evaluation of BrC's radiative forcing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
