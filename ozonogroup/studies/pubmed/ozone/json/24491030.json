The branching ratios of the OH- and ozone-forming reaction channels were determined using a combination of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF, for time-resolved OH concentration measurement) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS, for time-resolved O3 concentration measurement) following pulsed laser generation of HO2 and CH3C(O)O2 from suitable precursors. TAS was also used to determine the initial concentration of the reactant peroxy radicals. The data were evaluated by numerical simulation using kinetic models of the measured concentration profiles; a Monte Carlo approach was used to estimate the uncertainties of the rate constants (k3) and branching ratios (\u03b1) thus obtained. The reaction channel forming OH (R3a) was found to be the most important with \u03b13a = 0.61 \u00b1 0.09 and \u03b13c = 0.16 \u00b1 0.08. The overall rate coefficient of the title reaction was found to be k3 = (2.1 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) for both HO2 and DO2. Use of DO2 resulted in an increase in \u03b13a to 0.80 \u00b1 0.14. Comparison with former studies shows that OH formation via (R3) has been underestimated significantly to date. Possible reasons for these discrepancies and atmospheric implications are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Chemistry, Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Chemie , 55128 Mainz, Germany."}], "LastName": "Gross", "ForeName": "C B M", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dillon", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schuster", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lelieveld", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Crowley", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24491030", "10.1021/jp412380z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
