The concentrations, reactivity, and sources of VOCs were studied under different O<sub>3</sub> concentrations using compositional analysis. The results showed that the average VOCs concentration during the research period was(75.17\u00b138.67)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and was(112.33\u00b130.96)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, (66.25\u00b134.84)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> on pollution days and cleaning days, respectively(VOCs concentrations were 69.6% higher on pollution days). The contribution of VOCs species to the ozone formation potential(OFP) were ranked in the order aldehydes > aromatics > alkenes > alkanes. In the case of <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>, the main contributions were from aromatics(30.0%) and alkenes(25.8%) on pollution days, while the contribution from aromatic alkenes(29.8%) was a slightly higher than aromatics(28.0%) on cleaning days. By applying the positive matrix factorization(PMF) model, five major VOCs sources were extracted, namely vehicle emissions(34.4%), solvent usage and evaporation(31.7%), the petrochemical industry(15.7%), combustion(11.1%), and plant emissions(7.9%). The contributions of solvent usage and evaporation and plant emission sources on pollution days were 13.1% and 1.2% higher than on cleaning days, respectively, which was likely due to relatively higher temperatures on these days. Therefore, vehicle emissions and solvent usage and evaporation should be priorities in VOCs control strategies for the Langfang development zones between August to September."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing-Qiao", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Liang", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ao Lai Guo Xin(Beijing) Testing & Detection Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing 101399, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yun", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui-Ze", "Initials": "RZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Wen-Wen", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Development Zones Environmental Protection Agency, Langfang 065001, China."}], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "De-Yin", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-Lan", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581105", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202103142"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
