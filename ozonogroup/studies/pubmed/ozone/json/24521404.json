Nickel-doping increased the service lifetime by a factor of 9 and decreased the charge transfer resistance of the Sb-SnO2 electrodes by 65%. More importantly, Ni doping improved the electrocatalytic performance of Sb-SnO2 for the remediation of aqueous phenol and the inactivation of E. coli by a factor of more than 600% and \u223c20%, respectively. In the sulfate electrolyte, the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) identified were OH radicals (Faradaic efficiency \u03b7 = 2.4%) with trace levels of ozone and hydrogen peroxide (\u03b7 < 0.01%) at Sb-SnO2. In contrast, the primary ROS at Ni-Sb-SnO2 was ozone (\u03b7 = 9.3%) followed by OH radicals (\u03b7 = 3.7%). In the chloride electrolyte, the production of hypochlorite (OCl(-)) was higher (\u03b7 = 0.73%) than that of ozone (\u03b7 = 0.13%) at Sb-SnO2, whereas the level of ozone (\u03b7 = 13.6%) was much higher than that of hypochlorite (\u03b7 = 0.24%) at Ni-Sb-SnO2. Based on the shift of the reactive species, the primary effect of Ni doping is to catalyze the six-electron oxidation of water to ozone and inhibit the competing one or two-electron oxidation of water (generation of OH radicals, hydrogen peroxides, and hypochlorites). A range of electrochemical and surface analyses were performed, and a detailed mechanism was proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy Engineering, Kyungpook National University , Daegu 702-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "So Young", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dongseog", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Hyunwoong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Electrolytes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tin Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "339NCG44TV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IT35J3UV3", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimony"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KM7N50LOS6", "NameOfSubstance": "stannic oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antimony"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalytic Domain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrolytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tin Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24521404", "10.1021/es404688z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
