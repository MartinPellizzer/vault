However, previous studies suggested that hydroxylation was not the dominant pathway for atrazine degradation in the hydroxyl radical-generating systems such as Fenton reaction, ozonation and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Herein we report that the addition of sodium thiosulfate can realize rapid hydroxylation of atrazine to hydroxyatrazine at pH \u2264 4 under room temperature. High resolution mass spectra and isotope experiments results revealed that the hydroxylation of atrazine was involved with nucleophilic substitution and subsequent hydrolysis reaction as follows. HS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, as a species of thiosulfate only at pH \u2264 4, first attacked C atom connecting to chlorine of atrazine to dechlorinate atrazine and produce C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Subsequently, the S-S bond of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was cleaved easily to form SO<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S<sup>-</sup>. Next, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S<sup>-</sup> was hydrolyzed to generate hydroxyatrazine and H<sub>2</sub>S. Finally, the comproportionation of SO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S in situ produced S<sup>0</sup> during hydroxylation of atrazine with thiosulfate. This study clarifies the importance of degradation pathway on the removal of pollutants, and also provides a nonoxidative strategy for atrazine detoxification in seconds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pesticide & Chemical Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental Chemistry , Central China Normal University , Wuhan 430079 , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province for Persistent Pollutants Control and Resources Recycle , Nanchang Hangkong University , Nanchang 330063 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9176-5049"], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pesticide & Chemical Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental Chemistry , Central China Normal University , Wuhan 430079 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Guangming", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pesticide & Chemical Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental Chemistry , Central China Normal University , Wuhan 430079 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cuimei", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pesticide & Chemical Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental Chemistry , Central China Normal University , Wuhan 430079 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaobing", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pesticide & Chemical Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental Chemistry , Central China Normal University , Wuhan 430079 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ai", "ForeName": "Zhihui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province for Persistent Pollutants Control and Resources Recycle , Nanchang Hangkong University , Nanchang 330063 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3585-6541"], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province for Persistent Pollutants Control and Resources Recycle , Nanchang Hangkong University , Nanchang 330063 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Shenglian", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pesticide & Chemical Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental Chemistry , Central China Normal University , Wuhan 430079 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6842-9167"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lizhi", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiosulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QJA9M5H4IM", "NameOfSubstance": "Atrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atrazine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiosulfates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30793590", "10.1021/acs.est.8b06351"]}}]}
