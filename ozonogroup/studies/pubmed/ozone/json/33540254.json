This research is evaluated an in-situ sediment remediation method using ultrasound and ozone nanobubbles to remove organic and inorganic chemicals in contaminated sediments. Contaminated sediment is prepared by mixing synthetic fine sediment with an organic (p-terphenyl) and an inorganic chemical (chromium). The prepared contaminated sediment is treated with ultrasound and ozone nanobubbles under different operating conditions. For the samples with the maximum initial concentration of 4211\u00a0mg/kg Cr and 1875\u00a0mg/kg p-terphenyl, average removal efficiencies are 71% and 60%, respectively, with 240\u00a0min of sonication with 2-min pulses, whereas 97.5% and 91.5% removal efficiencies are obtained for the same, respectively, as a single contaminant in the sediment. For the same maximum concentrations, the highest removal of p-terphenyl is 82.7% with 127.2\u00a0J/ml high energy density, and for Cr, it is 77.1% using the highest number of the treatment cycle and ozone usage with 78.75/ml energy density. The Cr highest removal efficiency of 87.2% is recorded with the reduced initial concentration of 1227\u00a0mg/kg with the highest treatment cycles. The Cr removal efficiency depends on the availability of oxidizing agents and the number of washing cycles of sediments, whereas P-terphenyl degradation is most likely influenced by the combined effects of oxidation and ultrasound-assisted pyrolysis and combustion of organics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
