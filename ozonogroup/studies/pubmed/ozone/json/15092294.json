The experiment tested the hypothesis that an interaction of ozone/acid mist/soil/extreme climatic conditions is the cause of decline of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) at higher altitudes of the Inner Bavarian Forest. The main findings of the individual studies are presented and their implications for the hypothesis are discussed. Clear effects of soil and genetic factors (differences between clones), for example on growth and frost resistance were found. Treatment with O(3)/acid mist was shown to have effects on plant biochemistry, physiology, histology/ cytology, and growth. The wide scattering of these effects, and the lack of a consistent pattern of response across all clones does not permits a firm conclusion on the validity of the experimental hypothesis. These effects were not confounded by the nutrient stresses imposed during the initial exposure period and were not found to be cumulative during repeated treatments, as was proposed by the hypothesis. It is concluded that the experimental evidence does not indicate that ozone/acid mist are major factors to explain the Norway spruce decline on acidic sites at higher altitudes of the Inner Bavarian Forest and probably similar forest areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Power, Sudbury House, 15 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blank", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Payer", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfirrmann", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rehfuess", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092294", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90060-p", "0269-7491(90)90060-P"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
