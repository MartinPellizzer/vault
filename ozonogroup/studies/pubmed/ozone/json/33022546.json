Earthworms are a potential source of soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Application of biochar can mitigate earthworm-induced N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. However, the underlying interactive mechanism between earthworms and biochar in soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions is still unclear. A 35-day laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission dynamics for four different treatments, earthworm presence with biochar application (EC), earthworm presence without biochar application (E), earthworm absence with biochar application (C) and earthworm absence without biochar application, and the control. Results indicated a negative impact of biochar on earthworm activity, displaying a significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) lower survival rate and biomass of earthworms in treatment EC than E. Compared with the control, earthworm presence significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) increased cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, while application of biochar in the presence of earthworms significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) decreased cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (485 and 690\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> for treatments EC and E, respectively). Treatments E and EC significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) increased soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>N), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and soil pH as compared with the control. The gene copy number of 16\u00a0S rRNA, AOA, AOB, nirS, and nosZ increased for all treatments when compared with the control; however, a significant (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) difference among the studied genes was only observed for the nosZ gene (2.05 and 2.56\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> gene copies g<sup>-1</sup> soil for treatments E and EC, respectively). Earthworm-induced soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) reduced by biochar addition. The possible underlying mechanisms may include: (1) short-term negative impacts on earthworm activity; (2) a change of functional gene abundance in earthworm casts; and (3) an increase in soil pH due to addition of biochar."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
