The NDMA concentrations ranged from 4.7 to 15.1 ng/L in raw water samples, and from 4.68 to 46.9 ng/L in finished water. The NDMA concentration in raw water was found to be related with nitrite concentration, and during the treatment, the NDMA concentration increased following ozonation but decreased after subsequent activated carbon treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China. fengmanlou2005@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wanfeng", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jianying", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jianwei", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21235178", "10.1016/s1001-0742(09)60281-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
