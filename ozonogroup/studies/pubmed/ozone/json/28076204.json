The obtained apportionment with air samples taken in 1993 is consistent with the earlier published apportionment with air samples taken in 1992, validating the previous procedure. This analysis suggests that 75% of HC originate from mobile sources, 5-18% from fixed sources, and 7-20% from other sources (mainly solvents and bio-genic sources). A similar analysis was employed to estimate the relative contribution of HCs and nitric oxides (NO<sub>2</sub>) to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation, the most important air pollutant in Mexico City. In this way, through a local lineation of O<sub>3</sub> isopleths, simultaneous measurements of HC and NO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere were fitted to the equation-[O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>peak</sub> = [O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>a</sub> [HC] + m<sub>b</sub> [NO<sub>2</sub>]-to predict O<sub>3</sub> peak. With these data, the adjusted parameters show that NO<sub>2</sub>, not HC as was proposed previously, is the most important contributor to O<sub>3</sub> formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Autonomous National University of Mexico , Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riveros", "ForeName": "Hector G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Sciences Office, Mexican Petroleum Institute , Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arriaga", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Luis", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c National Center of Environmental Research and Training, National Institute of Ecology , Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tejeda", "ForeName": "Javier", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Biochemistry Department of Medicine Faculty , Autonomous National University of Mexico , Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Juli\u00e1n-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "Adriana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e National Institute of Ecology, and Biochemistry Department of the School of Medicine, Autonomous National University of Mexico , Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riveros-Rosas", "ForeName": "H\u00e9ctor", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28076204", "10.1080/10473289.1998.10463730"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
