The response of tropospheric oxidants to climate change is poorly constrained owing to large uncertainties in the degree to which processes that influence oxidants may change with climate and owing to a lack of palaeo-records with which to constrain levels of atmospheric oxidants during past climate transitions. At present, it is thought that temperature-dependent emissions of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> precursors and water vapour abundance determine the climate response of oxidants, resulting in lower tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> in cold climates while HO<sub>x</sub> (= OH\u2009+\u2009HO<sub>2</sub>\u2009+\u2009RO<sub>2</sub>) remains relatively buffered. Here we report observations of oxygen-17 excess of nitrate (a proxy for the relative abundance of atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sub>x</sub>) from a Greenland ice core over the most recent glacial-interglacial cycle and for two Dansgaard-Oeschger events. We find that tropospheric oxidants are sensitive to climate change with an increase in the O<sub>3</sub>/HO<sub>x</sub> ratio in cold climates, the opposite of current expectations. We hypothesize that the observed increase in O<sub>3</sub>/HO<sub>x</sub> in cold climates is driven by enhanced stratosphere-to-troposphere transport of O<sub>3</sub>, and that reactive halogen chemistry is also enhanced in cold climates. Reactive halogens influence the oxidative capacity of the troposphere directly as oxidants themselves and indirectly via their influence on O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sub>x</sub>. The strength of stratosphere-to-troposphere transport is largely controlled by the Brewer-Dobson circulation, which may be enhanced in colder climates owing to a stronger meridional gradient of sea surface temperatures, with implications for the response of tropospheric oxidants and stratospheric thermal and mass balance. These two processes may represent important, yet relatively unexplored, climate feedback mechanisms during major climate transitions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut des G\u00e9osciences de l'Environnement, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble 38508, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA."}], "LastName": "Murray", "ForeName": "Lee T", "Initials": "LT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}], "LastName": "Mickley", "ForeName": "Loretta J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Pu", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}], "LastName": "Schauer", "ForeName": "Andrew J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "Becky", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nature", "NlmUniqueID": "0410462", "ISSNLinking": "0028-0836"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Nature. 2017 May 31;546(7656):41-43. doi: 10.1038/546041a", "PMID": "28569805"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28514452", "10.1038/nature22340", "nature22340"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
