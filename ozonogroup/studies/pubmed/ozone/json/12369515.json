In phosphorus limited waters small changes in phosphorus concentration significantly affect microbial growth. We studied how water treatment processes in waterworks affect the availability of microbial nutrients and microbial growth potential in drinking water. The nutrients studied were assimilable organic carbon (AOCpotential) and microbially available phosphorus (MAP) which both were quantified by bioassays. Chemical coagulation, commonly used in surfacewater works, effectively removed AOCpotential and MAP. In contrast to activated carbon filtration, ozonation increased the concentrations of AOCpotential and MAP, and also microbial growth potential. In most of the drinking waters, microbial growth was limited by phosphorus, and microbial growth potential correlated with the MAP concentration. Microbial growth potential was lowest in drinking waters produced from surface waters with efficient treatment technique and highest in less treated ground waters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology, National Public Health Institute, P.O.
