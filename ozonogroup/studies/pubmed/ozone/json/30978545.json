Bacteria, especially pathogenic bacteria, play an important role in human health. The diversity, composition, and dynamics of airborne bacteria has been widely studied; however, the characteristics of pathogenic bacteria remain poorly understood. In this study, a high throughput sequencing method was used to explore the airborne opportunistic pathogenic bacteria during autumn and winter in Xi'an, China. An aggregated boosted tree (ABT) was developed to determine the relative influence of environmental factors on the proportions of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. Results showed that significantly more opportunistic pathogenic bacteria were found in winter than in autumn, and more opportunistic pathogenic bacteria were found in fine particulate matters (<2.5\u202f\u03bcm) than in PM<sub>10</sub> (<10\u202f\u03bcm). However, the composition of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria varied in autumn and winter. PM was the main factor affecting the proportions of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, and air contaminants (PM, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone) influenced the proportion of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria more than meteorological factors (relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed). Different factors may be responsible for the variances in opportunistic pathogenic bacterial communities in different seasons. This study may provide a reference to support the control of pathogenic bacteria in urban environments during haze events."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
