The indoor values closely tracked the outdoor values, and, depending on the ventilation rate, were 20 to 80 percent of those outdoors. The indoor/outdoor data are adequately described with a mass balance model. The model can also be coupled with reported air exchange rates to estimate indoor/outdoor ratios for other structures. The results from this and previous studies indicate that indoor concentrations are frequently a significant fraction of outdoor values. These observations, and the fact that most people spend greater than 90 percent of their time indoors, indicate that indoor ozone exposure (concentration X time) is greater than outdoor exposure for many people. Relatively inexpensive strategies exist to reduce indoor ozone levels, and these could be implemented to reduce the public's total ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weschler", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shields", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naik", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "JAPCA", "NlmUniqueID": "8802680", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0630"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2607364", "10.1080/08940630.1989.10466650"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
