CVD strains [spontaneously hypertensive (SH), SH stroke-prone (SHSP), SHHF/Mcc heart failure obese (SHHF), insulin-resistant JCR:LA-cp obese (JCR) and Fawn-Hooded hypertensive (FHH)] were compared with normal strains [Wistar, Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY)]. Total glutathione (GSH\u2009+\u2009GSSG or GSx), reduced ascorbate (AH2), uric acid (UA) and antioxidant enzymes were determined in lung, heart and BALF immediately (0\u2009h) or 20-h post 4-h nose-only exposure to 0.0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0\u2009ppm O3. Basal- and O3-induced antioxidant substances in tissues varied widely among strains. Wistar rats had a robust O3-induced increase in GSx and AH2 in the lung. Two CVD strains (JCR and SHHF) had high basal levels of AH2 and GSx in BALF as well as high basal lung UA. Across all strains, high BALF GSx was only observed when high BALF AH2 was present. CVD rats tended to respond less to O3 than normal. High-basal BALF AH2 levels were associated with decreased O3 toxicity. In summary, large differences were observed between both normal and CVD rat strains in low-molecular weight antioxidant concentrations in lung, BALF and heart tissue. Wistar (normal) and JCR and SHHF (CVD) rats appeared to stand out as peculiar in terms of basal- or O3-induced changes. Results elucidate interactions among antioxidants and air pollutants that could enhance understanding of cardiopulmonary disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Hatch", "ForeName": "Gary E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Crissman", "ForeName": "Kay", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Cores Unit , National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "LastName": "Schmid", "ForeName": "Judy", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Richards", "ForeName": "Judy E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Cores Unit , National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "William O", "Initials": "WO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Schladweiler", "ForeName": "Mette C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Ledbetter", "ForeName": "Allen D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "Urmila P", "Initials": "UP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Aconitate Hydratase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aconitate Hydratase"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26667331", "10.3109/08958378.2014.954170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
