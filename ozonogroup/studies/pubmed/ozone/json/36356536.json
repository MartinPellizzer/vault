Hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its dominant chemical components including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) and thirteen elements were measured using online instruments. Gaseous pollutants including NH<sub>3</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and O<sub>3</sub> and meteorological parameters were also synchronously measured. PM<sub>2.5</sub> was dominated by carbonaceous aerosols in summer and by WSIIs in the other seasons. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its dominant chemical components mostly peaked around noon (10:00-14:00 LST). Furthermore, high PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels during the daytime were closely related with the increased NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels. The high mass concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in urban Dongguan during the daytime were likely related with regional transport of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from suburban Dongguan, which was originated from the reaction between NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> under the moisture condition during the nighttime. Seven major source factors for PM<sub>2.5</sub> including secondary sulfate, ship emission, traffic emission, secondary nitrate, industrial processes, soil dust and coal combustion were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, which contributed 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014%, 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016%, 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010%, 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011%, 12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011%, 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% and 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%, respectively, to annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentration. Although secondary sulfate contributed much more than secondary nitrate to PM<sub>2.5</sub> on annual basis, the latter exceeded the former source factor when daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentration was higher than 60\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, indicating the critical role nitrate played in PM<sub>2.5</sub> episode events."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
