Hospital admissions for HS and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period 2006-2010. The relative risk of hospital admissions was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased HS admissions were significantly associated with PM2.5 levels both on warm days (>23\u00b0C) and cool days (<23\u00b0C), with an interquartile range rise associated with a 12% (95% CI = 7-18%) and 4% (95% CI = 0-8%) elevation in admissions for HS, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, PM2.5 remained significantly high after inclusion of SO2 or O3 on both warm and cool days. This study provides evidence that higher levels of PM2.5 increase the risk of hospital admissions for HS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Hui-Fen", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Chih-Ching", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hemorrhagic Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25119737", "10.1080/15287394.2014.926801"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
