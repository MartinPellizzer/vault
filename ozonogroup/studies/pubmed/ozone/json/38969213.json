However, the feasibility of the DBD implementation is not clear due to its high energy consumption and relatively low degradation efficiency. In this research, a novel strategy was suggested based on re-circulation of the generated O<sub>3</sub> in the DBD system to enhance the PNP degradation efficiency and energy yield. The potential mechanism and possible pathway of PNP degradation were studied by EPR, ESR, DFT and GS-MS analytical tests. According to the results, the PNP degradation efficiency and energy yield increased from 57.4% to 94.4% and from 0.52 to 1.18\u00a0g\u00a0kW<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively through ozone circulation into the DBD reactor. This was due to the more release of long-lived and short-lived reactive species (ROS) in the DBD-O<sub>3</sub> system by the O<sub>3</sub> circulation. The variations in pH (4-10), initial concentration (50-90\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>), and the presence of co-existing substances in the water matrix had minimal impact on the DBD-O<sub>3</sub> system, in comparison to the conventional system. The biological toxicity evaluation revealed that the hybrid DBD-O<sub>3</sub> system transform PNP to less toxic intermediates. This study proposes a promising strategy to improve the utilization of DBD for the degradation of PNP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
