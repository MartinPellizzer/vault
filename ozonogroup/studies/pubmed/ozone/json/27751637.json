They are currently based on single species responses which do not reflect the multi-species nature of semi-natural vegetation communities. Also, the potential effects of other factors like the nitrogen (N) input are not considered in their derivation, making their use uncertain under natural conditions. Exposure- and dose-response relationships were derived from two open-top chamber experiments exposing a mixture of 6 representative annual Mediterranean pasture species growing in natural soil to 4 O<sub>3</sub> fumigation levels and 3\u00a0N inputs. The Deposition of O<sub>3</sub> and Stomatal Exchange model (DO<sub>3</sub>SE) was modified to account for the multi-species nature of the canopy following a big-leaf approach. This new approach was used for estimating a multi-species phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> dose (POD<sub>y-MS</sub>). Response relationships were derived based on O<sub>3</sub> exposure (AOT40) and flux (POD<sub>y-MS</sub>) indices. The treatment effects were similar in the two seasons: O<sub>3</sub> reduced the aboveground biomass growth and N modulated this response. Gas exchange rates presented a high inter-specific variability and important inter-annual fluctuations as a result of varying growing conditions during the two years. The AOT40-based relationships were not statistically significant except when the highest N input was considered alone. In contrast, POD<sub>y-MS</sub> relationships were all significant but for the lowest N input level. The influence of the N input on the exposure- and dose-response relationships implies that N can modify the O<sub>3</sub> CLe. However, this is an aspect that has not been considered so far in the methodologies for establishing O<sub>3</sub> CLe. Averaging across N input levels, a multi-species O<sub>3</sub> CLe (CLe<sub>f-MS</sub>) is proposed POD<sub>1-MS</sub>\u00a0=\u00a07.9\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>, accumulated over 1.5 month with a 95% confidence interval of (5.9, 9.8). Further efforts will be needed for comparing the CLe<sub>f-MS</sub> with current O<sub>3</sub> CLe<sub>f</sub> based on single species responses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
