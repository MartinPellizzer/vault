The construction of highly dispersed active sites on heterogeneous catalysts is an ideal strategy to combine the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with high activity and stability. Herein, an iron-containing mesoporous silica material (Fe-SBA15) with sufficient iron site exposure and enhanced intrinsic activity of active sites was employed to activate ozone for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation. Approximately 100% of BPA and 36.6% of total organic carbon (TOC) removal were realized by the Fe-SBA15 catalytic ozonation strategy with a reaction constant of 0.076\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>, well beyond the performance of FeO<sub>x</sub>/SBA15 mixture and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis demonstrated that the hydroxyl radicals (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>) and superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) played an important role in the degradation process. The iron sites with recyclable Fe(III)/Fe(II) pairs act as both the electron donors and active sites for catalytic ozonation. The mesoporous framework of SBA15 in Fe-SBA15 stabilizes the iron sites that enhance its stability. With high catalytic performance and high reusability for catalytic ozonation of BPA, the Fe-SBA15 is expected to be a promising catalyst in catalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
