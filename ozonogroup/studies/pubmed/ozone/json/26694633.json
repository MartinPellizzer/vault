Here, we quantify the impact of ozone pollution on two major U.S. crops, wheat and soybean, and two ozone-sensitive tree species, ponderosa pine and quaking aspen, using simulations with the GEOS-Chem model for 2010. Using previously established exposure-response functions, we estimate nationwide relative yield reductions of 4.9% for wheat and 6.7% for soybean, and relative biomass loss of 2.5% and 2.9% for ponderosa pine and aspen seedlings, respectively. Adjoint model sensitivities are used to estimate the impact of emissions sources from different locations, species, and sectors. We find that the nationwide relative loss in each vegetation type is influenced most by domestic anthropogenic NOx (>75%). Long-range transport from foreign sources is small relative to domestic influences. More than half of the anthropogenic NOx responsible for vegetation damage originates from outside the states where the damage occurs. Texas and Missouri are the highest contributors to the nationwide loss of wheat and soybean, respectively. California \"exports\" ozone damage for all types of vegetation studied, due to its location, high share of anthropogenic NOx, and a relatively low share of vegetation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Lapina", "ForeName": "Kateryna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Henze", "ForeName": "Daven K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Milford", "ForeName": "Jana B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University , Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Travis", "ForeName": "Katherine", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Missouri"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus ponderosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26694633", "10.1021/acs.est.5b04887"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
