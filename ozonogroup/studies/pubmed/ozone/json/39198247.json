This study investigated the effect of air quality and pollutants on pulmonary function and inflammation in patients with asthma in Shanghai.", "The study monitored 27 asthma outpatients for a year, collecting data on weather, patient self-management [daily asthma diary, peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring, medication usage], spirometry and serum markers. To explore the potential mechanisms of any effects, asthmatic mice induced by ovalbumin (OVA) were exposed to PM <sub>2.5</sub>.", "Statistical and correlational analyses revealed that air pollutants have both acute and chronic effects on asthma. Acute exposure showed a correlation between PEF and levels of ozone (O <sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO <sub>2</sub>). Chronic exposure indicated that interleukin-5 (IL-5) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) levels correlated with PM <sub>2.5</sub> and PM <sub>10</sub> concentrations. In asthmatic mouse models, exposure to PM <sub>2.5</sub> increased cytokine levels and worsened lung function. Additionally, PM <sub>2.5</sub> exposure inhibited cell proliferation by blocking the NF-\u03baB and ERK phosphorylation pathways.", "Ambient air pollutants exacerbate asthma by worsening lung function and enhancing Th2-mediated inflammation. Specifically, PM <sub>2.5</sub> significantly contributes to these adverse effects. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which PM <sub>2.5</sub> impacts asthma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.
