Here we studied the effect of 10 combinations of climatic conditions (temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and drought) under controlled growth chamber conditions on the grain yield, protein, and mineral content of 3 wheat varieties. Results show that wheat plants under O<sub>3</sub> exposure alone concentrated\u2009+\u200915 to\u2009+\u200931% more grain N, Fe, Mg, Mn P and Zn, reduced K by -\u20095%, and C did not change. Ozone in the presence of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and higher temperature enhanced the content of Fe, Mn, P and Zn by 2-18%. Water-limited chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure resulted in\u2009+\u20099 to\u2009+\u200946% higher concentrations of all the minerals, except K. The effect of climate abiotic factors could increase the ability of wheat to meet adult daily dietary requirements by\u2009+\u20096% to\u2009+\u200912% for protein, Zn and Fe, but decrease those of Mg, Mn and P by -\u20093% to -\u20096%, and K by -\u200962%.
