These three processes are ozonation, photocatalysis and granulated activated carbon adsorption. This process has been developed through three scales: laboratory, pilot and pre-industrial scale. At each scale, its efficiency has been assessed on different waste waters: laboratory-made water, industrial waste water (one from a company cleaning textiles and another from a company preparing culture media, both being in continuous production mode) and municipal waste water. At laboratory scale, a TiO<sub>2</sub>-based photocatalytic coating has been produced and the combination of ozonation-UVC photocatalytic treatment has been evaluated on the laboratory-made water containing 22 micropollutants. The results showed an efficient activity leading to complete or partial degradation of all compounds and an effective carbon for residual micropollutant adsorption was highlighted. Experiments at pilot scale (100\u2005L of water treated at 500\u2005L/h from a tank of 200\u2005L) corroborated the results obtained at laboratory scale. Moreover, tests on municipal waste water showed a decrease in toxicity, measured on <i>Daphnia Magma</i>, and a decrease in micropollutant concentration after treatment. Finally, a pre-industrial container was built and evaluated as a tertiary treatment at the WWTP Duisburg-Vierlinden. It is shown that the main parameters for the efficiency of the process are the flow rate and the light intensity. The photocatalyst plays a role by degrading the more resistant micropollutants. Adsorption permits an overall elimination >95% of all molecules detected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2281-9626"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering - Nanomaterials, Catalysis & Electrochemistry, University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Condensed Matter and Nanosciences (IMCN), Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Energie- und Umwelttechnik e.V.
