Cochlear ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury is considered one of the most important causes of human idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The aim of the present study was to study the efficacy of ozone therapy against cochlear damage caused by IR injury and to investigate the potential clinical use of this treatment for sudden deafness. Twenty-eight guinea pigs were randomized into four groups. The sham group (S) (n\u00a0=\u00a07) was administered physiological saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 7 days. The ozone group (O) (n\u00a0=\u00a07) was administered 1\u00a0mg/kg of ozone i.p. for 7 days. In the IR\u2009+\u2009O group (n\u2009=\u20097), 1 mg/kg of ozone was administered i.p. for 7 days before IR injury. On the eighth day, the IR\u2009+\u2009O group was subjected to cochlear ischemia for 15\u00a0min by occluding the bilateral vertebral artery and vein with a nontraumatic clamp and then reperfusion for 2\u00a0h. The IR group was subjected to cochlear IR injury. After the IR procedure, the guinea pigs were sacrificed on the same day. In a general histological evaluation, cochlear and spiral ganglionic tissues were examined with a light microscope, and apoptotic cells were counted by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The apoptotic index (AI) was then calculated. Blood samples were sent for analyses of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase, malondialdehyde (MDA), the total oxidant score (TOS), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Data were evaluated statistically using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The AI was highest in the IR group. The AI of the IR\u2009+\u2009O group was lower than that of the IR group. The biochemical antioxidant parameters SOD and GSH-Px and the TAC values were highest in the O group and lowest in the IR group. The MDA level and TOS were highest in the IR group and lowest in the O group. Controlled ozone administration stimulated endogenous antioxidant defense systems, thereby helping the body to combat IR injury. Although this study revealed a statistically significant decrease in cochlear IR damage following ozone therapy, further studies will be necessary to explain the protective mechanisms of ozone therapy in cochlear IR injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Konya Educational and Training Hospital."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onal", "ForeName": "Merih", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Selcuk University Medical Faculty."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elsurer", "ForeName": "Cagdas", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Konya Educational and Training Hospital."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selimoglu", "ForeName": "Nebil", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yilmaz", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erdogan", "ForeName": "Ender", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Selcuk University Medical Faculty."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bengi Celik", "ForeName": "Jale", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Baskent University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kal", "ForeName": "Oznur", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Selcuk University Medical Faculty."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onal", "ForeName": "Ozkan", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Artif Organs", "NlmUniqueID": "7802778", "ISSNLinking": "0160-564X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cochlea"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cochlear Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28261890", "10.1111/aor.12863"]}}]}
