Despite anatomical and histological interspecies differences, ozone exposures resulted in common nasal qualitative alterations with an anterior-posterior gradient of phenomena occurring immediately, and with a lag time postexposure: epithelial disruption and increased permeability, inflammatory cell influx, and proliferative and secretory responses. Described mechanisms of toxicity included a direct effect of ozone on epithelial lining fluid and cellular membranes and the subsequent release of cytokines and cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products. An indirect effect of ozone was indicated by a decreased mucociliary clearance, free radicals production interacting with a gene promoting factor, and increased DNA synthesis. Studies highlighted the pivotal role of activated neutrophils and mast cells leading to the release of deleterious enzymes (tryptase, eosinophil cationic protein) and numerous cytokines. Experiments performed with ozone exposure/allergen challenge reported that, besides the intrinsic deleterious properties of ozone, it also had a priming effect on the late-phase response to allergen challenge, providing new insights into the pathophysiology of respiratory allergic diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'Hygi\u00e8ne et de Sant\u00e9 Publique, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Universit\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Paris, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nikasinovic", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Momas", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seta", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "9802627", "ISSNLinking": "1093-7404"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "108"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12888446", "10.1080/10937400306477", "JV94B9B7914EBD8K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
