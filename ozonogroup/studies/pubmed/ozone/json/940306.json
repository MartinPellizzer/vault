The chamber was constructed entirely of non-corrosive materials and was suitable for continuous exposure of 6 small laboratory animals to corrosive atmospheres such as ozone. A separate, outer chamber surrounding a smaller, inner chamber permitted access to each individually housed animal without disturbing the experimental atmosphere. Facilities were available for ad libitum access to food and water for chronic exposures. The chamber was easily disassembled for cleaning. A safety mechanism was described which automatically stops the generation of a toxic gas in the event of an exhaust system failure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montgomery", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortenson", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lab Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "1266503", "ISSNLinking": "0023-6764"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Laboratory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Housing, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["940306"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
