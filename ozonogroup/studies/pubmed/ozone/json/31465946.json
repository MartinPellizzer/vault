A flow rate of 1.6\u202fmL\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup>, 10\u202fmM of sodium sulfate electrolyte, 1.0\u202fmM of phenol (model aromatic compound), and an ozone dose of 12\u202fmgO<sub>3</sub>\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> were used. Insight into the synergistic mechanism was achieved via carbon anode morphology characterization and phenol degradation kinetics analysis. Improved kinetic performance was observed for the combined process (O<sub>3</sub>-ECF) as compared to the sum of the individual processes, not only towards phenol degradation (3.2-fold increase), but also towards phenol mineralization (2.2-fold increase). Scanning electron microscopy revealed a significant decrease of polymer formation and deposition on CNT after the hybrid O<sub>3</sub>-ECF process as compared to the ECF alone. Voltage-dependent (0-2.5\u202fV) ozone CNT functionalization was investigated at pH 7-11 to assist in elucidation of the synergistic mechanism. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated increases up to 26-fold in CNT oxygen content post-ozonation at pH 7 comparing to fresh CNT. Various potential O<sub>3</sub>-ECF synergistic reaction mechanisms for organic aromatic oxidation and mineralization are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
