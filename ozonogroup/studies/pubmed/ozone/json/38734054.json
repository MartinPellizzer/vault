AOP has been considered an alternative treatment method for wastewater treatment. Bromine is present in natural waters posing toxic effects on human health and hence, its removal from drinking water sources is necessary. Of the many techniques advanced oxidation is covered in this review. This review systematically examines literature published from 1997 to April 2024, sourced from Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, focusing on the efficacy of AOPs for pollutant removal from aqueous solutions containing bromide ions to investigate the impact of bromide ions on AOPs. Data and information extracted from each article eligible for inclusion in the review include the type of AOP, type of pollutants, and removal efficiency of AOP under the presence and absence of bromide ion. Of the 1784 documents screened, 90 studies met inclusion criteria, providing insights into various AOPs, including UV/chlorine, UV/PS, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, UV/catalyst, and visible light/catalyst processes. The observed impact of bromide ion presence on the efficacy of AOP processes, alongside the AOP method under scrutiny, is contingent upon various factors such as the nature of the target pollutant, catalyst type, and bromide ion concentration. These considerations are crucial in selecting the best method for removing specific pollutants under defined conditions. Challenges were encountered during result analysis included variations in experimental setups, disparities in pollutant types and concentrations, and inconsistencies in reporting AOP performance metrics. Addressing these parameters in research reports will enhance the coherence and utility of subsequent systematic reviews."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
