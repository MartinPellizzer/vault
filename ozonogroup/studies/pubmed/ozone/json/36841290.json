The association between short-term air pollution exposure and AF episodes has been recognized. But the evidence of the association between long-term air pollution exposure and AF was limited, especially in developing countries.", "We performed a nationwide cross-sectional study among 1,374,423 individuals aged \u226535\u00a0years from 13 health check-up centers. Using logistic regression models, we assessed the association between long-term exposure to single air pollution and AF prevalence, including particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> compositions, which were estimated by high-resolution and high-quality spatiotemporal datasets of ground-level air pollutants for China. The quantile g-computation model was used to explore the joint effect of all exposures to air pollution and the contribution of an individual component to the mixture.", "In single-pollutant models, an increase of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (OR 1.031[95%CI 1.010,1.053]) and PM<sub>10</sub> (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.021 [95%CI 1.009,1.033]) was positively associated with AF prevalence. The stratified analyses revealed that these associations were significantly stronger in females, people <65\u00a0years old, and those with hypertension and diabetes. In the further exploration of the joint effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> compositions (OR 1.060 [95%CI 1.022,1.101]) per quintile increase in all five PM<sub>2.5</sub> components), we found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> sulfate contributed the most.", "These findings provide important evidence for the positive relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and AF prevalence in China and identify sulfate particles of PM<sub>2.5</sub> as having the highest contribution to the overall mixture effects among all\u00a0PM2.5 chemical constituents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
