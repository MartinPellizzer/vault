PFASs are persistent to biodegradation and conventional oxidation processes such as ozonation. In this study electrochemical degradation of PFASs on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes is demonstrated. Experiments were performed with model solutions and contaminated groundwater with a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of 13 mg/L. The perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) perfluorobutanoate, perfluoropentanoate, perfluorohexanoate, perfluoroheptanoate and perfluorooctanoate, and the perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) perfluorobutane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, perfluorooctane sulfonate and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate were detected in the groundwater samples. At PFAS concentrations ranging from 0.26 to 34 mg/L (0.7 to 79 \u03bcM), the degradation of PFASs was achieved despite of the high DOC background. Pseudo first-order kinetic constants of PFSA degradation increased with the increase of carbon chain length. Fluoride formation as well as the generation of PFCAs with shortened chain lengths was observed. Inorganic byproducts such as perchlorate were also formed and have to be considered in further process optimization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biotechnology, DVGW-Water Technology Center (TZW), Karlsruher Str. 84, 76139 Karlsruhe, Germany E-mail: andreas.tiehm@tzw.de."}], "LastName": "Trautmann", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biotechnology, DVGW-Water Technology Center (TZW), Karlsruher Str. 84, 76139 Karlsruhe, Germany E-mail: andreas.tiehm@tzw.de."}], "LastName": "Schell", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biotechnology, DVGW-Water Technology Center (TZW), Karlsruher Str. 84, 76139 Karlsruhe, Germany E-mail: andreas.tiehm@tzw.de."}], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DECHEMA-Forschungsinstitut, Theodor-Heuss-Allee 25, 60486 Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}], "LastName": "Mangold", "ForeName": "K-M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biotechnology, DVGW-Water Technology Center (TZW), Karlsruher Str. 84, 76139 Karlsruhe, Germany E-mail: andreas.tiehm@tzw.de."}], "LastName": "Tiehm", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Groundwater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26442500", "10.2166/wst.2015.143"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
