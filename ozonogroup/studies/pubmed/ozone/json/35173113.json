However, the exact mechanism of particulate matter-induced cell death remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present in vitro study using human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) was to determine the cell death pathway(s) induced by black carbon (BC) and ozone oxidized-black carbon (O-BC). BC and O-BC induced A549 cell death and the cytotoxic effect was dose-dependent. Cell death was significantly abrogated by inhibitor of receptor protein interacting kinase 1 (RIPK1) but only mildly inhibited by apoptosis inhibitor and RIPK3. BC- and O-BC-treated cells showed RIPK1 and RIPK3 protein overexpression and high phosphorylated levels of these proteins, as well as detectable levels of caspase-8 active form. BC- and O-BC-triggered cell death was also fully rescued in A549 cells that under-expressed RIPK1 with RIPK1 siRNA. Our results indicated that BC and O-BC could induce cell death through a multitude of pathways including apoptotic and necroptotic pathways and that RIPK1 is the upstream signal protein of these cell death pathways, with an important role in the regulation of BC-induced cell death."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Quanzhou Medical College."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xianyan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine, Quanzhou Medical College."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhaojun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine, Quanzhou Medical College."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Shiyong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery and Department of Allergy, Beijing TongRen Hospital, Affiliated with the Capital University of Medical Science."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Yuhui", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8100317", "ISSNLinking": "0388-6107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "RIPK1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35173113", "10.2220/biomedres.43.23"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
