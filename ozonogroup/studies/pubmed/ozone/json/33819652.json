Two different treatment strategies were tested: i) pre-ozonation of the wastewater followed by an UVC/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process (two-step treatment); ii) simultaneous application of O<sub>3</sub>/UVC/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> combined process (one-step treatment). For the two-step strategy, the pre-treatment with 30\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/min for 10\u00a0min reduces significantly total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and colour, reducing light filtering effects and increasing the efficiency of the following UVC/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. In turn, the one-step treatment strategy (O<sub>3</sub>/UVC/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) allows a more efficient use of injected O<sub>3</sub> by reducing the amount of O<sub>3</sub> required (from 273 to 189\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/L<sub>effluent</sub>) to achieve similar mineralization levels. The real bio-treated slaughterhouse wastewater treated by O<sub>3</sub>/UVC/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process achieved final colour values of 20 Pt/Co, TSS of 35\u00a0mg/L and COD of 61\u00a0mg O<sub>2</sub>/L, allowing its direct discharge into water compartments according to European Council Directive 91/271/EEC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
