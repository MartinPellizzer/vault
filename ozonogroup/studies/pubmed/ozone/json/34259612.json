The aim of this investigation was to examine the acute toxicity produced by a PW sample in aquatic organisms <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>Daphnia similis</i> prior to and after 4 treatments using advanced oxidative processes such as photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, ozonation and photoelectrocatalytic ozonation. Data demonstrated that exposure to PW was toxic to both organisms, as evidenced by reduced luminescence in bacterium <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and induced immobility in <i>Daphnia similis</i>. After treatment of PW with 4 different techniques, the PW remained toxic for both tested organisms. However, photoelectrocatalysis was more efficient in decreasing toxicity attributed to PW sample. Therefore, data demonstrate the importance of treating PW for later disposal in the environment in order to mitigate ecotoxicological impacts. Further photoelectrocatalysis appeared to be a promising tool for treating PW samples prior to disposal and exposure of aquatic ecosystems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Viana", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rialto", "ForeName": "T C R", "Initials": "TCR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (Unesp), Chemistry Institute, Araraquara, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Brito", "ForeName": "J F D", "Initials": "JFD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Companhia Ambiental do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (CETESB), Divis\u00e3o de Laborat\u00f3rio de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Micas", "ForeName": "A F D", "Initials": "AFD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Abe", "ForeName": "F R", "Initials": "FR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Companhia Ambiental do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (CETESB), Divis\u00e3o de Laborat\u00f3rio de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Savazzi", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (Unesp), Chemistry Institute, Araraquara, SP, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, National Institute for Alternative Technologies of Detection, Toxicological Evaluation and Removal of Micropollutants and Radioactivies (INCT-DATREM), S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Chemistry, Araraquara, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Boldrin Zanoni", "ForeName": "M V B", "Initials": "MVB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4256-2621"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, National Institute for Alternative Technologies of Detection, Toxicological Evaluation and Removal of Micropollutants and Radioactivies (INCT-DATREM), S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Chemistry, Araraquara, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Oliveira", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aliivibrio fischeri"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aquatic Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Daphnia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34259612", "10.1080/15287394.2021.1951910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
