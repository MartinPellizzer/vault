Although acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common secondary event in ill patients, evidence regarding the association between air pollution and AKI accompanied by specific comorbidities is limited. This study aimed to estimate the association between short-term exposure to air pollution (fine particulate matter \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm [PM<sub>2.5</sub>] and ozone [O<sub>3</sub>]) and incident AKI by comorbid diseases using the Korea National Health Information Database (NHID). Total of 160,390 incident AKI cases, defined as an emergency department (ED) visit due to AKI, were observed within the period 2015-2021 in inland South Korea. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> individually, using a conditional logistic regression model within each case and its own control (three or four days of the same day of the week in the same month) to estimate the association between short-term air pollution exposure and ED visits due to AKI. Short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was associated with ED visits due to AKI with ORs of 1.008 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.999, 1.017) and 1.019 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.033) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in lag 0-1 day PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> respectively, although OR for PM<sub>2.5</sub> was marginally significant. The odds of incident AKI associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> was evident in conjunction with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumonia. For O<sub>3</sub>, the estimated odds was prominent for AKI with ischemic heart disease. In addition, the comorbid disease-specific odds of AKI attributed to air pollution varied by sex and age. Our findings provide epidemiological evidence of a plausible mechanism between air pollution and incident AKI and suggest the need for personalized AKI prevention strategies attributed to air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
