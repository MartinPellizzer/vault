However, application of SAMs in the preparation of separation membranes remains unexplored. In the present study, surface-modified poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) membranes were prepared using SAMs to fabricate a membrane for use in pervaporation separation of ethanol/water mixtures. A cross-linked PDMS/polysulfone (PSf) composite membrane was transformed by introducing hydroxyl functionalities on the PDMS surface through a UV/ozone conversion process. (Tridecafluoroctyl)triethoxysilane was allowed to be adsorbed on the resulting Si-OH substrate to increase the hydrophobicity of the membrane. Results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, and contact angle analyses suggest that the fluoroalkylsilane monolayer was successfully formed on the modified PDMS/PSf membrane treated by 60 min UV/ozone exposure. The newly SAM-modified membrane exhibited a separation factor of 13.1 and a permeate flux of 412.9 g/(m(2) h), which are higher than those obtained from PDMS membranes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Membrane Technology, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Shulan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guojun", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hongxia", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23701288", "10.1021/la400930y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
