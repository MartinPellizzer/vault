The concentrations during the four seasons followed the order:summer > autumn > spring > winter, and the maximum appeared in July. The ozone pollution of East China, South China, and North China were more serious than other regions in China. The variation of longitude had a small influence on the ozone concentration, while the influence of latitude is significant. According to the analysis contrasting three different topographies in the same latitude, the influence of topography on ozone concentration was negligible. Furthermore, the research found a significant positive correlation between surface ozone concentration and temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Xiao-Tong", "Initials": "XT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Nian-Wen", "Initials": "NW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Jing-Shu", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Si-Peng", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Xiu-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964555", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201703045"]}}]}
