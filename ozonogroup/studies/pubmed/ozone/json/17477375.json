Given the physiochemical properties of O(2/3) gas mixture including fairly low aqueous solubility and spreading, and the interesting perspective of hyperoxia, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of O(2/3) treatment on two human neuroblastoma cell lines (SK-N-SH and SK-N-DZ). In this study, we demonstrated that O(2/3) treatment was able to induce cell growth inhibition and cell cycle perturbation in both cell lines. We observed an arrest at G(2) phase, accompanied by an alteration in the expression and localization of cyclin B1/cdk1 complex and a reduction in its activity in SK-N-SH cells. This reduction was consistent with the increase in both Wee1 and chk1 protein levels. On the contrary, O(2/3) induced apoptosis in SK-N-DZ cells via caspase 3 activation and Poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP) cleavage, associated with an increase in the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. Consequently, we considered the possibility of improving the responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents such as Cisplatin, Etoposide, and Gemcitabine in combination with O(2/3) treatment. The combined treatments produced a stronger cell inhibitory effect than Cisplatin and Etoposide used alone in SK-N-SH cells. On the contrary, the combination data were not significantly different from O(2/3) treatment alone in SK-N-DZ cells, thus suggesting that the obtained changes in cell growth inhibition were due to the effect of O(2/3) alone."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AFAR-Centro Ricerca S.
