However, their natural decomposition usually takes years or even decades, which raises an imminent demand for an efficient removal technology. Herein we report a core-shell CeOx@MnOx catalyst for enhancing ozonation of polystyrene nanoplastics in water. Ozonation achieves 31.67% molecular weight removal of polystyrene nanoplastics in the first 10\u00a0min reaction, which is increased to 51.67% in catalytic ozonation by MnOx and further improved to 73.33% in catalytic ozonation via CeOx@MnOx. The remarkable thing is the CeOx@MnOx could achieve almost 96.70% molecular weight removal after 50\u00a0min reaction. The specific catalytic mechanism is ozone decomposes into reactive oxygen radicals (\u2022OH, \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) after capturing electrons from MnOx, improving the polystyrene nanoplastics removal. Meanwhile, the Mn averaged valence state increases, making it harder to donate electrons to ozone. This can be alleviated by encapsulating the CeOx core in the MnOx, enabling electrons replenishment from the CeOx core to the MnOx shell, which is verified by the experiment and density functional theory calculations. The repeated experiment demonstrates the CeOx@MnOx possesses excellent stability, maintaining 95.25-96.70% removal efficiency of polystyrene nanoplastics. This research provides a possibility for the efficient removal of nanoplastics in water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
