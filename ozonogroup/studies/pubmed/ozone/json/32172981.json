Under space velocity of 300,000 hr<sup>-1</sup>, the ozone conversion over the pH\u00a0=\u00a07 catalyst under dry conditions and relative humidity of 65% over a period of 6\u00a0hr was 100% and 96%, respectively. However, the ozone decomposition activity of the pH\u00a0=\u00a02 and 4 catalysts distinctly decreased under relative humidity of 65% compared to that under dry conditions. Detailed physical and chemical characterization demonstrated that the residual sulfate ions on the pH\u00a0=\u00a02 and 4 catalysts decreased their hydrophobicity and then restrained humid ozone decomposition activity. The pH\u00a0=\u00a02 and 4 catalysts had inferior resistance to high space velocity under dry conditions, because the residual sulfate ion on their surface reduced their adsorption capacity for ozone molecules and increased their apparent activation energies, which was proved by temperature programmed desorption of O<sub>2</sub> and kinetic experiments. Long-term activity testing, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that there were two kinds of oxygen vacancies on the manganese dioxide catalysts, one of which more easily adsorbed oxygen species and then became deactivated. This study revealed the detrimental effect of surface acid ions on the activity of catalysts under humid and dry atmospheres, and provided guidance for the development of highly efficient catalysts for ozone decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
