This process will change the interaction between effluent organic matter and pollutants in aquatic environment. The impact of ozonation on complexation between dissolved organic matter in such wastewater and sulfadimidine often found in natural water was studied in laboratory experiments using four types of real wastewater. Ozonation was found to decrease the proportion of organic matter with a molecular weight greater than 5\u00a0kDa as well as protein-like, fulvic-like and humic-like components, but except the proportion of hydrophilic components. The aromaticity of the dissolved organic matter was also reduced after ozonation. The complexation of tryptophan and tyrosine with sulfadimidine mainly depends on their hydrophobicity and large molecular weight. Ozonation of fulvic and humic acid tends to produce small and medium molecular weight hydrophilics. The complexation of humic and fulvic acids with sulfadimidine was enhanced by ozonation. Dissolved organic matter, with or without oxidation, were found to weaken sulfadimidine's inhibition of microbial growth, especially for Aeromonas and Acinetobacter species. This finding will expand our understanding about the impact of advanced treatment processes on the dissolved organic matters' properties in effluent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
