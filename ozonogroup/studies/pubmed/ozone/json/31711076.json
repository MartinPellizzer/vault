The animals were randomly divided into three groups: control, photobiomodulation, and ozone therapy. In all groups, miniscrew implants were loaded with 500 gf at 0, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively (G1, G2, and G3). Several biomechanical and histologic analyses were performed in different centers to measure the implant stability quotient level, bone volume, and bone-to-implant contact.", "According to the results of the Infinite Focus Microscopy, the ozone therapy group revealed significantly higher scores than the control group and photobiomodulation group at the 4-week loading time, whereas the photobiomodulation and ozone therapy groups revealed significantly higher scores than the control group at the 8-week loading time in terms of bone volume measurements in mm<sup>3</sup> (P < .05). According to the histologic analysis, the ozone therapy and photobiomodulation groups revealed significantly higher scores than the control group at the 4-week loading time, whereas the photobiomodulation group showed the highest scores among the 8-week loading groups (P < .05).", "This is the first study in the literature that reveals a better osseointegration process in miniscrew implants when treated with photobiomodulation and ozone therapy compared with control groups. Although the photobiomodulation and ozone therapy groups did not reveal significantly higher scores in immediately loaded miniscrew implants (G1), these treatments were significantly more effective when loaded after 4 or 8 weeks of osseointegration (G2 and G3). SLA-surfaced miniscrew implants are successful in the orthopedic forces (500 gf) and can be removed without complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Y\u00fccesoy", "ForeName": "T\u00fcrker", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seker", "ForeName": "Elif Dilara", "Initials": "ED"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cenkc\u0131", "ForeName": "Ebru", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yay", "ForeName": "Arzu", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alkan", "ForeName": "Alper", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants", "NlmUniqueID": "8611905", "ISSNLinking": "0882-2786"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Implants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomechanical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Implants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mandible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osseointegration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31711076", "10.11607/jomi.7601"]}}]}
