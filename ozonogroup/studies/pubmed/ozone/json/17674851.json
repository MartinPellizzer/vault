The study of electrochemical processes has shown free chlorine to be produced, but smaller amounts of stronger oxidants, such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide and OH radicals (*OH), were also generated. The formation of mixed oxidants increased with increasing electric conductivity, but was limited at conductivities greater than 0.6 mS/cm. Using several microorganisms, such as E. coli and MS2 bacteriophage, inactivation kinetic studies were performed. With the exception of free chlorine, the role of mixed oxidants, especially OH radicals, was investigated for enhancement of the inactivation rate. Additionally, the formation and reduction of DBPs was studied by monitoring the concentration of haloacetic acids (HAAs) during the process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, YIEST, Yonsei University, 234 Maeji, Heungup, Wonju city, Gangwon, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "B S", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Page", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mari\u00f1as", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Electrolytes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9159UV381P", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroxide ion"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Butanols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Electrolytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Levivirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17674851", "10.2166/wst.2007.409"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
