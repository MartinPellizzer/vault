A thin layer of a poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) is achieved by spin coating dissolved PMMA onto a variety of underlying substrates at various thicknesses in a range of c. 5-27 nm. Varying the PMMA concentration, time and spinning speed controls the thickness of the spin coated layer. The root-mean-squared roughness values of the spin coated PMMA are less than 1.5 nm, resulting in smooth and uniform layer. Substrate functionalisation is carried out by either ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>) or oxygen plasma oxidation. Both techniques result in initially stable, highly functional films as demonstrated by the covalent attachment of amino-modified oligonucleotides, however longevity studies comparing the stability of films attached following oxidative activation show better stability for UV/O<sub>3</sub> activated substrates when compared to oxygen plasma activated substrates. PMMA films activated by UV/O<sub>3</sub> yield highly stable (for up to 24 days) functional surfaces that retain immobilised biomolecules after several extended wash steps. In contrast, films attached to surfaces pre-treated with oxygen plasma discharge lose their functionality within 5 days of oxidation. Direct DNA and sandwich antibody assays were successfully demonstrated on the UV/O<sub>3</sub> functionalised surfaces, showing a low level of non-specific binding. Furthermore, the quenching of fluorescently labelled biomolecules bound to PMMA-coated gold-coated slides is shown to be dependent on the PMMA thickness, indicating potential usage in surface-plasmon resonance-based assays."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Diagnostics Institute, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland. susan.kelleher@dcu.ie."}], "LastName": "Rowinska", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kelleher", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Soberon", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ricco", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Daniels", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mater Chem B", "NlmUniqueID": "101598493", "ISSNLinking": "2050-750X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32261933", "10.1039/c4tb01748j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
