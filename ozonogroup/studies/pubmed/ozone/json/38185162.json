Here we apply the recently developed GEOS-Chem High Performance (GCHP) global atmospheric chemistry model with \u223c0.5\u00b0 stretched resolution over China to understand the sources of Chinese background ozone (CNB) in the metric of daily maximum 8\u00a0h average (MDA8) and to identify the drivers of its interannual variability (IAV) from 2015 to 2019. The GCHP ozone simulations over China are evaluated with an ensemble of surface and aircraft measurements. The five-year national-mean CNB ozone is estimated as 37.9 ppbv, with a spatially west-to-southeast downward gradient (55 to 25 ppbv) and a summer peak (42.5 ppbv). High background levels in western China are due to abundant transport from the free troposphere and adjacent foreign regions, while in eastern China, domestic formation from surface natural precursors is also important. We find greater importance of soil nitric oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) than biogenic volatile organic compound emissions to CNB ozone in summer (6.4 vs. 3.9 ppbv), as ozone formation becomes increasingly NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive when suppressing anthropogenic emissions. The percentage of daily CNB ozone to total surface ozone generally decreases with increasing daily total ozone, indicating an increased contribution of domestic anthropogenic emissions on polluted days. CNB ozone shows the largest IAV in summer, with standard deviations (seasonal means) of \u223c5 ppbv over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and >3.5 ppbv in eastern China. CNB values in QTP are strongly correlated with horizontal circulation anomalies in the middle troposphere, while soil NO<sub>x</sub> emissions largely drive the IAV in the east. El Nino can inhibit CNB ozone formation in Southeast China by increased precipitation and lower temperature locally in spring, but enhance CNB in Southwest China through increased biomass burning emissions in Southeast Asia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
