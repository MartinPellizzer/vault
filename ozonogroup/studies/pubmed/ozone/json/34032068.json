Ozone concentrations exceeded the National Air Quality Grade \u2161 Standard in 59% of cases. In this study, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/HNO<sub>3</sub> indicator was applied to analyze summertime ozone sensitivity in Handan using the WRF-CMAQ modeling system. The results showed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/HNO<sub>3</sub> was more appropriate than other ozone indicators, both theoretically and based on simulation outputs. The good simulation effect of CMAQ on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> was attributed to fine emission inventory and grid resolution. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/HNO<sub>3</sub> simulation results showed that the relative importance of a VOCs-limited regime decreased month by month; a VOCs-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-mixed-limited regime was dominant in June; and a NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regime was more dominant in July and August than in June. The remarkable spatial difference in VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission ratios among the counties of Handan led to differences in ozone sensitivity. The VOCs-limited regime was concentrated in counties where VOCs/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission ratios were lower than 1.7. Southern counties had a NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regime, where VOCs/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission ratios were higher than 6.9. Counties with VOCs/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission ratios varying from 1.7 to 6.9 were more susceptible to both VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>. According to these results, the transition range of HCHO/NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/HNO<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> ratios were adjusted to 0.35-0.6, 20-35, and 10-25 respectively. Adjusting the transition range of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/(O<sub>3</sub>+NO<sub>2</sub>) was not effective, indicating that this indicator may not be applicable to Handan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Shui-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Sheng-Ju", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Shi-Yin", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Ze-Ya", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Pan-Bo", "Initials": "PB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34032068", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202010243"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
