They are listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as priority pollutants because of their carcinogenicity and toxicity. Employing ozonation as a remediation technique, this work investigated the treatability of a sediment sample from a freshwater boat slip subjected to coal tar contamination over a long period. The contaminated sediment sample contained high levels of PAHs in the forms of naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene, among other byproducts present in the humic and solid phases of the sediment. The objectives of this work were to examine (1) the degradation of PAHs in the contaminated sediment as treated by ozonation in the slurry form, (2) the effects of ozonation upon the soil matrix and the biodegradability of the resultant PAH intermediates, and (3) the feasibility of a combined technique using O3 as a pretreatment followed by biological degradation. The sediment was made into 3% w/w soil slurries and ozonated in a 1.7-L semi-batch, well-stirred reactor equipped with pH control and a cold trap for the gaseous effluent. Samples were collected after different ozonation durations and tested for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), UV absorbance, and toxicity, along with quantitative and qualitative determinations of the parent and daughter intermediates using gas chromatography/flame ionization detection (GC/FID), GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and ion chromatography (IC) techniques. The GC/MS technique identified 16 compounds associated with the humic and solid phases of the sediment. Intermediates identified at different ozonation times suggested that the degradation of PAHs was initiated by an O3 attack resulting in ring cleavage, followed by the intermediates' oxidation reactions with O3 and the concomitant OH radical toward their mineralization. Results suggested that ozonation for 2 hr removed 50-100% of various PAHs in the solid and liquid phases (as well as the aqueous and gaseous media resulting from the treatment process) of the sediment sample and that organic and inorganic constituents of the sediment were also altered by ozonation. Measurements and comparisons of BOD, COD, UV absorbance, and toxicity of the samples further suggested that ozonation improved the bioavailability and biodegradability of the contaminants, despite the increased toxicity of the treatment effluent. An integrated chemical-biological system appeared to be feasible for treating recalcitrant compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA. hong@civil.utah.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "P K Andrew", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Geologic Sediments"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15152665", "10.1080/10473289.2002.10470751"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
