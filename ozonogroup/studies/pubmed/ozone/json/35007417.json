Ozonation of EfOM adds to molecular complexity by introducing polar and potentially mobile ozonation byproducts (OBPs). Currently, nontargeted direct infusion (DI) ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (e.g. FT-ICR-MS) is used to study OBPs but requires sample extraction, limiting the accessible polarity range of OBPs. To better understand the impact of ozonation on EfOM and the formation of polar OBPs, nonextracted effluent was analyzed by direct injection onto a reversed-phase liquid chromatography system (RP-LC) online hyphenated with an FT-ICR-MS. Over four times more OBPs were detected in nonextracted EfOM compared to effluent extracted with solid phase extraction and measured with DI-FT-ICR-MS (13817 vs 3075). Over 1500 highly oxygenated OBPs were detected exclusively in early eluting fractions of nonextracted EfOM, indicating polar OBPs. Oxygenation of these newly discovered OBPs is higher than previously found, with an average molecular DBE-O value of -3.3 and O/C ratio of 0.84 in the earliest eluting OBP fractions. These polar OBPs are consistently lost during extraction but may play an important role in understanding the environmental impact of ozonated EfOM. Moreover, 316 molecular formulas classified as nonreactive to ozone in DI-FT-ICR-MS can be identified with LC-FT-ICR-MS as isomers with varying degrees of reactivity, providing for the first time experimental evidence of differential reactivity of complex organic matter isomers with ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4508-0190"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Jennings", "ForeName": "Elaine", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kremser", "ForeName": "Arina", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9844-144X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Limei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1606-0764"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Analytical Chemistry, University of Leipzig, 04103, Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Reemtsma", "ForeName": "Thorsten", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5313-6014"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ProVIS-Centre for Chemical Microscopy, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Lechtenfeld", "ForeName": "Oliver J", "Initials": "OJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35007417", "10.1021/acs.est.1c04310"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
