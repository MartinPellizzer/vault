SE had significantly more fast-reacting dissolved organic matter (DOM) moieties than GW and SW. Therefore, O<sub>3</sub> decomposed much faster in SE than in GW and SW. At specific ozone doses of 0.5-1.5\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the application of O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and E-peroxone process (by adding external H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stocks or in-situ generating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from cathodic O<sub>2</sub> reduction during ozonation) similarly enhanced the OH yield from O<sub>3</sub> decomposition by \u223c5-12% and 5-7% in GW and SW, respectively, compared to conventional ozonation. In contrast, due to the slower reaction kinetics of O<sub>3</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than O<sub>3</sub> with fast-reacting DOM moieties, the addition or electro-generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> hardly increased the OH yield (<4% increases) in SE. Corresponding to the changes in the OH yields, the abatement efficiencies of ozone-resistant pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen and clofibric acid) increased evidently in GW (up to \u223c14-18% at a specific ozone dose of 1.5\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC), moderately in SW (up to 6-10% at 0.5\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC), and negligibly in SE during the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and E-peroxone treatment compared to conventional ozonation. These results indicate that similar to the conventional O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, the E-peroxone process can more pronouncedly enhance O<sub>3</sub> transformation to OH, and thus increase the abatement efficiency of ozone-resistant pharmaceuticals in water matrices exerting relatively high ozone stability (e.g., groundwater and surface water with low DOM contents). Therefore, by installing electrodes in existing ozone reactors, the E-peroxone process may provide a convenient way to enhance pharmaceutical abatement in drinking water applications, where groundwater and surface water with low DOM contents are used as the source waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
