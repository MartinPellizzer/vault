We analyzed the association between the ambient carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particular matter 10 (PM10), and air quality index (AQI) with cord blood levels of endothelin-1, vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM), and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM).
