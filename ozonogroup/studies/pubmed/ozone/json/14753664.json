The use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and other novel technologies for research in the area of air sampling and analysis requires systems/devices for reliable standard gas generation and sampling. In this paper we describe a new gas standard generating system for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-VOCs that was designed, built, and tested to facilitate fundamental and applications research with SPME. The system provided for the generation of a wide range of VOC/semi-VOC concentrations and mixing various standard gases, estimation of detection limits, testing the effects of sampling time, air temperature and relative humidity, testing the effects of air velocity and ozone on sampling/extractions. The system can be also used for calibrations of analytical instrumentation, quality control and quality assurance checks, and cross-validations of SPME with/and other sampling techniques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ont., N2L 3G1 Canada. koziel@tamu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koziel", "ForeName": "Jacek A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martos", "ForeName": "Perry A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pawliszyn", "ForeName": "Janusz", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14753664", "10.1016/j.chroma.2003.10.079", "S0021-9673(03)01956-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
