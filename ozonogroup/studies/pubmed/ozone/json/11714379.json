All samples were analyzed for residues by GLC and HPLC. Ozonation and HPA treatment were effective in degrading mancozeb in solution. Rate of mancozeb degradation was dependent on pH, with the fastest rate at pH 7.0. Ethylenethiourea (ETU) residue concentrations in the mancozeb solutions were monitored over 60 min. Under controlled conditions, the ETU residue concentrations increased during the 15 min reaction time and then decreased for all three pH values. At 3 ppm of ozone treatment, no ETU residues were detected at all three pH ranges after 15 min of reaction time. Degradation of ETU by HPA was greatest at pH 4.6, and no ETU residues remained after 5 min at either 5 or 50 ppm. The results showed that ozone and HPA gave excellent degradation of pesticide residues depending on pH and temperature. These experiments indicated the potential for the removal of pesticide residues on fruit and in processed products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Institute for Environmental Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cash", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zabik", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12427-38-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Maneb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24FOJ4N18S", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenethiourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I6KPI2E1HD", "NameOfSubstance": "Peracetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R0HY55EB9E", "NameOfSubstance": "mancozeb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X1FSB1OZPT", "NameOfSubstance": "Zineb"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenethiourea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Maneb"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peracetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Zineb"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11714379", "10.1021/jf0106650", "jf0106650"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
