The loss of M2 muscarinic receptors function occurs in asthmatics and it contributes to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and it is not a chronic feature of asthma, instead it characterizes asthma exacerbation. The loss of M2 muscarinic receptor function in children and adults happens during antigen bronchoprovocation or during exposition of asthmatics to ozone. After inhalation, ipratropium bromide (IB) can be found in a small quantity in circulation and it links less readily to muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscles as related to its absorption after intravenous application. In the stepwise approach of asthma inhaled anticholinergics is recommended if the symptoms of the disease cannot be adequately controlled by a regular inhalation of antiinflammatory drugs with beta2-agonist and oral steroids. The improvement of the airway inspiratory capacity is more elevated than the improvement of FEV1 after inhalation of IB. IB has similar effect as salbutamol and it is recommended to control a stable chronic obstructive disease. During our numerous investigations and up-to-date experience in the usage of 5-7 microg/kg/body mass of IB repeated every 4-6 hours in combination with salbutamol, we did not notice adverse effects of the drug in infants. IB is recommended for hospital treatment of children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stojkovi\u0107-Andjelkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Andjelka", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Obradovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Slobodan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vuleti\u0107", "ForeName": "Biljana", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radlovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Vladimir", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Serbia", "MedlineTA": "Srp Arh Celok Lek", "NlmUniqueID": "0027440", "ISSNLinking": "0370-8179"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinergic Antagonists"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinergic Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}], "NumberOfReferences": "24"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20607989", "10.2298/sarh1006379s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
