Different air quality parameters have hitherto been examined which add to the burden of pollen allergy sufferers. Parameters such as NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> are supposed to have additional impact, not only on health in general (increase in asthma, allergy sensitization frequency), but also on pollen grains (increase of allergenicity). However, it remains unknown if those air quality parameters increase symptom severity during the pollen season. We selected the birch, grass, and ragweed pollen seasons as different time periods throughout the year and analyzed the relationship of symptom data to pollen, air quality, and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity) for the metropolis of Vienna (Austria). A linear regression model was computed based on different symptom data, and both pollen and air quality data were tested simultaneously. Ozone was positively and significantly associated with symptom scores in all three seasons, whereas this was only rarely the case with other pollutants. Therefore, only ozone was selected for further analysis in a model including meteorological parameters. In this model, effect estimates of ozone were attenuated but remained significant for the grass pollen season. The lack of significance in the other seasons may be attributed to the less numerous symptom data entries and the shorter duration of the pollen seasons for birch and ragweed. All other air quality parameters usually showed lower concentrations during the pollen seasons and displayed little variation. This might explain the lack of a clear signal. Our results suggest that today's allergic population is already affected by air quality (rising O<sub>3</sub> levels). Air quality should be considered as well in pollen information and pollen allergy studies in general because of its increasing importance in the light of global warming."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
