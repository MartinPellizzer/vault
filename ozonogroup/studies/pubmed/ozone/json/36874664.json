Healing of the extraction wound has rarely received any importance during regular dental extractions, despite being an inherent element of the process of tooth extraction itself. This study aimed to analyze the analgesic and antibacterial efficacy of topical-ozonized olive oil compared to regular drugs administered post-operatively to patients who have undergone tooth extraction as well as evaluate the healing effects of the former on the extraction site. Methodology A total of 200 patients in need of exodontia were randomly divided into two groups, with group A (case group) receiving ozonized olive oil as a topical application for three days and group B (control group) receiving standard post-operative treatment (antibiotics and analgesics). On day five, patients in both groups were assessed for wound healing using the Landry, Turnbull, and Howley Index and for pain using the visual analog scale (VAS). Results On days two and three, the P-value for differences in pain (VAS score) between the two groups was 0.409, but on day five, it was 0.180. According to the Landry, Turnbull, and Howley index, the P-value for differences in wound healing between the groups on day five was 0.025. When comparing the two groups, there was no discernible difference in the amount of discomfort perceived after surgery. While both groups saw improvement in wound healing and pain, the case group coped better than the control group in terms of wound healing. Conclusions This study demonstrated that ozonized olive oil may be used as a safe and effective alternative to conventional painkillers and antibiotics and can speed up wound healing after exodontia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Satapathy et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, New Horizon Dental College and Research Institute, Bilaspur, IND."}], "LastName": "Satapathy", "ForeName": "Ayush", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, New Horizon Dental College and Research Institute, Bilaspur, IND."}], "LastName": "Balani", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, New Horizon Dental College and Research Institute, Bilaspur, IND."}], "LastName": "Kharsan", "ForeName": "Vinay", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, New Horizon Dental College and Research Institute, Bilaspur, IND."}], "LastName": "Karan", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, New Horizon Dental College and Research Institute, Bilaspur, IND."}], "LastName": "Mazhar", "ForeName": "Heena", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, New Horizon Dental College and Research Institute, Bilaspur, IND."}], "LastName": "Awasthy", "ForeName": "Arunima", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Efficiency of gaseous ozone in reducing the development of dry socket following surgical third molar extraction.
