We investigate O<sub>3</sub> impacts from smoke in 18 western US cities during July-September, 2013-2017, with ground-based monitoring data from air quality system sites, using satellite-based hazard mapping system (HMS) fire and smoke product to identify overhead smoke. We present four key findings. First, O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcm in diameter) are elevated at nearly all sites on days influenced by smoke, with the greatest mean enhancement occurring during multiday smoke events; nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) are not consistently elevated across all sites. Second, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exhibit a nonlinear relationship such that O<sub>3</sub> increases with PM<sub>2.5</sub> at low to moderate 24 h PM<sub>2.5</sub>, peaks around 30-50 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>, and declines at higher PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Third, the rate of increase of morning O<sub>3</sub> is higher and NO/NO<sub>2</sub> ratios are lower on smoke-influenced days, which could result from additional atmospheric oxidants in smoke. Fourth, while the HMS product is a useful tool for identifying smoke, O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are elevated on days before and after HMS-identified smoke events implying that a significant fraction of smoke events is not detected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington 98195 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2324-1590"], "LastName": "Buysse", "ForeName": "Claire E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Science , University of Alabama in Huntsville , Huntsville , Alabama 35899 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaulfus", "ForeName": "Aaron", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Science , University of Alabama in Huntsville , Huntsville , Alabama 35899 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Udaysankar", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington 98195 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics , University of Washington-Bothell , Bothell , Washington 98011 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1965-9051"], "LastName": "Jaffe", "ForeName": "Daniel A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31597429", "10.1021/acs.est.9b05241"]}}]}
