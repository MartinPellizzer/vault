The results showed that ozone mainly oxidized strong hydrophobic, high relative molecular mass (<i>M</i><sub>r</sub>) compounds and the high <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> was transferred to medium and small <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> hydrophilic fractions. Ozone could control fouling effectively, demonstrating that hydrophobic organic matter with higher <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> contributed to membrane fouling. PAC adsorbed organics with small <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> and alleviated membrane fouling, showing that organics with small <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> contributed also to membrane fouling. The ozone and PAC combination controlled membrane fouling and also enhanced the removal of organics, demonstrating the synergistic effect of such a combination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Yangtze River Water Environment, Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Bing-Zhi", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Hao-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Meng-Liu", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965629", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201710052"]}}]}
