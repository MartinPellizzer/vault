The purified glutathione reductase was resolved into six isoforms by chromatofocusing. The isoform eluting with an isoelectric point of 4.9 accounted for 18% of the total activity. The five isoforms with isoelectric points between 4.1 and 4.8 accounted for 82% of the activity. Purified glutathione reductase from isolated, intact chloroplasts also resolved into six isoforms after chromatofocusing. The isoform eluting at pH 4.9 constituted a minor fraction of the total activity. By comparing the chromatofocusing profile of the seedling extract with that of the chloroplast extract, we inferred that the least acidic isoform was extraplastidic and that the five isoforms eluting from pH 4.1 to 4.8 were plastidic. Both the plastidic (five isoforms were pooled) and extraplastidic glutathione reductases had a native molecular mass of 114 kD. The plastidic glutathione reductase is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 55 kD. Both glutathione reductases had optimum activity at pH 7.8. The K(m) for the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) was 56.0 and 33.8 mum for plastidic and extraplastidic glutathione reductase, respectively, at 25 degrees C. The K(m) for NADPH was 4.8 and 4.0 mum for plastidic and extraplastidic isoforms, respectively. Antiserum raised against the plastidic glutathione reductase recognized a 55-kD polypeptide from purified antigen on western blots. In addition to the 55-kD polypeptide, another 36-kD polypeptide appeared on western blots of leaf crude extracts and the purified extraplastidic isoform. The lower molecular mass polypeptide might represent GSSG-independent enzyme activity observed on activity-staining gels of crude extracts or a protein that has an epitope similar to that in glutathione reductase. Fumigation with 75 nL L(-1) ozone for 4 h on 2 consecutive days had no significant effect on glutathione reductase activity in peas (Pisum sativum L.). However, immunoblotting showed a greater level of glutathione reductase protein in extracts from ozone-fumigated plants compared with that in control plants at the time when the target concentration was first reached, approximately 40 min from the start of the fumigation, and 4 h on the first day of fumigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology and Weed Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madamanchi", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "J V", "Initials": "JV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alscher", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cramer", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hess", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1977 May;59(5):1011-2", "ArticleIdList": ["16659940"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1963 Jan;86:173-91", "ArticleIdList": ["13932735"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Nov;94(3):1402-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16667845"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1986 Jan;80(1):27-33", "ArticleIdList": ["16664597"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Biochem. 1985 Jun 3;149(2):411-9", "ArticleIdList": ["3996414"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1990 Nov 1;282(2):233-8", "ArticleIdList": ["2241146"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1986 Oct;82(2):351-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16665034"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1987 Sep;85(1):100-3", "ArticleIdList": ["16665639"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Feb;86(2):619-22", "ArticleIdList": ["16665956"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Sep;97(1):88-93", "ArticleIdList": ["16668420"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Nov;76(3):615-21", "ArticleIdList": ["16663894"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Apr;95(4):1026-35", "ArticleIdList": ["16668087"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16652936", "PMC1075528", "10.1104/pp.100.1.138"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
