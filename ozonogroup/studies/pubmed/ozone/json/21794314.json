Of the 5 studies in disk herniation, only 3 were clinical trials and none used random allocation. Study participants were generally patients with symptomatic small discal hernias. There was wide variability in the dose of ozone injected as well as in the controls used for comparison. All outcome measures were subjective and there was no blinded evaluation of the results. The study in Raynaud's syndrome included only 4 patients. Adverse effects were not evaluated in detail.", "The use of ozone therapy in musculoskeletal diseases is based on poor quality studies.
