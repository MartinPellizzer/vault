The catalysts were characterized, and the density functional theory (DFT) simulation of ozone adsorption on Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-X were carried out to investigate the influence of adsorption energy on catalytic performance. The results showed that the removal efficiency (RE) of each VOC component was similarly improved by Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-X catalysts, and the greatest increase in VOCs' removal efficiency was obtained (7.8% for toluene, 86.2% for acetone, and 82.5% for ethyl acetate) at a special input energy (SIE) of 700\u00a0J\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> with Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-La catalyst. Characterization results demonstrated that Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-La catalyst had the highest content of low valence Mn elements and the greatest O<sub>ads</sub>/O<sub>latt</sub> ratio, as well as the lowest reduction temperature. Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-La catalyst also presented superior catalytic effect in improving carbon balance (CB) and CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity ( [Formula: see text] ). The CB and [Formula: see text] were increased by 47.7% and 12.61% respectively with Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-La at a SIE of 400\u00a0J\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> compared with that when only \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was applied. The DFT simulation results of ozone adsorption on Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-X catalysts indicated that the adsorption energy of catalyst crystal was related to the catalytic performance of the catalyst. The Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-La/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst, which had the highest absolute value of adsorption energy, presented the best performance in improving VOCs' RE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
