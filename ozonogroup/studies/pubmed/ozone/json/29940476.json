Our study population included all Canadian-born residents aged 20-40 years who lived in the province of Ontario, Canada from 2001 to 2013. Incident MS was ascertained from a validated registry. We assigned estimates of annual concentrations of these pollutants to the residential postal codes of subjects for each year during the 13 years of follow-up. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each pollutant separately using random-effects Cox proportional hazards models. We conducted various sensitivity analyses, such as lagging exposure up to 5 years and adjusting for access to neurological care, annual average temperature, and population density.", "Between 2001 and 2013, we identified 6203 incident cases of MS. The adjusted HR of incident MS was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86-1.07) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 0.91(95% CI: 0.81-1.02) for NO<sub>2</sub>, and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.98-1.23) for O<sub>3</sub>. These results were robust to various sensitivity analyses conducted.", "In this large population-based cohort, we did not observe significant associations between MS incidence and long-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> in adults in Ontario, 2001-2013."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2018.
