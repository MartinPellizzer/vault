In the times of a respiratory disease pandemic, members of the dental profession, due to having a direct contact with the patients' oral cavity, body fluids and airborne pathogens, are exposed to a great occupational hazard of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The authors carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase, and Web of Science) with the following keywords: \"COVID-19,\" \"2019-nCoV,\" \"coronavirus,\" \"SARS-CoV-2,\" \"dental COVID-19,\" \"dentistry COVID-19,\" \"occupational hazards dentistry,\" \"ventilation,\" \"air disinfection,\" \"airborne transmission,\" \"hydrogen peroxide disinfection,\" \"UV disinfection,\" \"ozone disinfection,\" \"plasma disinfection,\" and \"TiO<sub>2</sub> disinfection.\" They included publications focused on COVID-19 features, occupational hazards for dental staff during COVID-19 pandemic, and methods of air disinfection. They found that due to the work environment conditions, if appropriate measures of infection control are not being implemented, dental offices and dental staff can become a dangerous source of COVID-19 transmission. That is why the work safety protocols in dentistry have to be revised and additional methods of decontamination implemented. The authors specifically advise on the utilization of wildly accepted methods like ultraviolet germicidal irradiation with additional disinfection systems, which have not been introduced in dentistry yet, like vaporized hydrogen peroxide, non-thermal plasma and air filters with photocatalytic disinfection properties. Due to its toxicity, ozone is not the first-choice method for air decontamination of enclosed clinical settings.
