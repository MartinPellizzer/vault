Compared with independent O<sub>3</sub> (35.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.20%), mineralization of ciprofloxacin (CIP) under the Mn-CeO<sub>x</sub>@\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (MCAO) process was elevated to 76.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.30%. The synergetic corporation among multivalence redox pairs of Mn (III)/Mn (IV), Ce (III)/Ce (IV) promoted the protonation of the surface hydroxyl group (S-OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>), and subsequently the dominant reactive oxygen species in the MCAO process, OH and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, were generated rapidly. However, the mineralization of CIP decreased in MCAO/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> system due to the formation of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, which reacted with CIP more slowly (8.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>) than OH (4.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>). In MCAO/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> mixture saline conditions, mineralization of CIP was improved at low Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration (0.5\u00a0wt%) due to the generation of Cl, while inhibited with excessive Cl<sup>-</sup> (\u22651.5\u00a0wt%) owing to the formation of residual chlorides (Cl<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and ClO<sup>-</sup>). Meanwhile, the MCAO process possessed promising capability to remediate hypersaline wastewater containing dyes, phenol and pesticides, as well as actual salinity-rich wastewater. Based on the above, the present study would provide new insights into hypersaline organic wastewater treatment by the MCAO process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
