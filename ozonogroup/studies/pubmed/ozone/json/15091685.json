Seedlings of two bean cultivars were exposed to incremental ozone concentrations (120, 180 and 270 microg m(-3) for 8-h day(-1)) for five days and primary leaves were subsequently inoculated with conidia suspended in water or in an inorganic phosphate solution (Pi), and with mycelium. Ozone injury increased with increasing ozone concentration and was much higher in the ozone-sensitive cultivar 'Pros' than in the ozone-insensitive 'Groffy'. Ozone only increased the number of lesions on leaves of Pros after inoculation with either of the conidial suspensions. The Pi-stimulated infection in Groffy was reduced by the lower ozone concentrations. Ozone decreased lesion expansion after inoculation with mycelium. In a chronic fumigation experiment, plants of the two cultivars were exposed to 90 microg m(-3) (7-h day(-1)) and the primary and the oldest tree trifoliate leaves were inoculated after five and seven weeks of exposure. Ozone enhanced the senescence-related injury only in Pros. The number of lesions was not influenced by ozone for either cultivar, conidial suspension or inoculation date. Lesion expansion after inoculation with mycelium was generally reduced in exposed plants. Thus, contrasting effects of ozone on the susceptibility of bean leaves to B. cinerea were observed depending on the cultivar, the conidial suspension, the disease parameter and the ozone exposure pattern. In extrapolating the laboratory results to the field, it is suggested that episodic and chronic exposures to ambient ozone are of minor importance in increasing the susceptibility of bean leaves to B. cinerea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Plant Protection (IPO-DLO), P.O.
