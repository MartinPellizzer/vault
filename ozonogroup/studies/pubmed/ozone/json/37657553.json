This study aims to explore the effectiveness of incorporating the tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> vertical column density (VCD) from OMI and TROPOMI (hereafter referred to as OMI and TROPOMI, respectively, for conciseness) for deriving surface NO<sub>2</sub> and to apply the resulting data to revisit the spatiotemporal variations in surface NO<sub>2</sub> for Beijing over the 2005-2020 period during which there were significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions. In the OMI versus TROPOMI performance comparison, the cross-validation R<sup>2</sup> values were 0.73 and 0.72, respectively, at 1\u00a0km resolution and 0.69 for both at 100\u00a0m resolution. The comparisons between satellite data sources indicate that even though TROPOMI has a finer resolution it does not improve upon OMI for deriving surface NO<sub>2</sub> at 1\u00a0km resolution, especially for analyzing long-term trends. In light of the comparison results, we used a hybrid approach based on machine learning to derive the spatiotemporal distribution of surface NO<sub>2</sub> during 2005-2020 based on OMI. We had novel, independent passive sampling data collected weekly from July to September of 2008 for hindcasting validation and found a spatiotemporal R<sup>2</sup> of 0.46 (RMSE\u00a0=\u00a07.0\u00a0ppb). Regarding the long-term trend of surface NO<sub>2</sub>, the level in 2008 was obviously lower than that in 2007 and 2009, as expected, which was attributed to pollution restrictions during the Olympic Games. The NO<sub>2</sub> level started to steadily decline from 2015 and fell below 2008's level after 2017. Based on OMI, a long-term and fine-resolution surface NO<sub>2</sub> dataset was developed for Beijing to support future environmental management questions and epidemiological research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
