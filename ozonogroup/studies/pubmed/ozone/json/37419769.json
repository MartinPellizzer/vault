Community pharmacists' assertiveness might be associated with pharmacist-initiated prescribing changes to improve medication safety.", "Our objective was to examine which types of assertiveness-related self-expression are associated with community pharmacist-initiated prescribing changes while adjusting for possible confounding factors.", "We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Japan between May and October 2022 in 10 prefectures. Community pharmacists belonging to a large pharmacy chain were recruited. The outcome variable was the frequency of community pharmacist-initiated prescription changes over 1 month. Community pharmacists' assertiveness was assessed using the Interprofessional Assertiveness Scale (IAS) and 3 sub-domains (nonassertive, assertive, and aggressive self-expression). Participants were classified into 1 of 2 categories based on medians. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared by group with univariate analysis. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to investigate the association between pharmacist-initiated prescription changes as an ordinal variable and pharmacists' assertiveness.", "Of 3346 community pharmacists invited, 963 were included in the analysis. Participants with high assertive self-expression scores had a significantly higher frequency of pharmacist-initiated prescription changes. There was no association between nonassertive or aggressive self-expression and pharmacist-initiated prescription changes. After adjustments, high assertive self-expression remained associated with a high frequency of community pharmacist-initiated prescription changes (odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.74; p\u00a0=\u00a00.032).", "Higher assertive self-expression among community pharmacists is associated with higher frequency of pharmacist-initiated prescription changes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
