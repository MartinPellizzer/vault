Studies over the past decades have linked respiratory drug use (consumption or sales) with changes in air pollution conditions.", "Twenty-one studies were analyzed to discuss whether increased levels of air pollution are associated with the use of medications for respiratory diseases.", "Epidemiological studies agree that variation in the drug use is related to air pollution exposure. In panel studies, although asthmatics are more sensitive to air pollution effects, the increase in drug use was comparable and similar to non-asthmatics. Ecological studies confirm a significant association in respiratory drug sales depending on the selected lags (that is the time elapsing between air pollution measurement and the resulting drug use). The results of a meta-analysis of two ecological studies showed an increase in risk for increase in daily mean concentration of some pollutant (10 \u00b5g m(-3) ). For Black Smoke RR=1.007 (95% CI 1.004-1.011) for lag 1, and RR=1.008 (95% CI 1.005-1.010) for lag 8. For Nitrogen dioxide, RR=1.008 (95% CI 1.005-1.012) for lag 8 and for Sulfur dioxide, RR=1.005 (95% CI 1.001-1.010) for lag 9.", "The analysis of drug use provides useful data for the evaluation of risks which derive from exposure to air pollution. More studies are needed to measure the effects of air pollution on respiratory medication use. Lags of up to 14 days have to be considered and the pollutants to be considered should include particulate matter and ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Nutrition and Health Sciences, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Calabria, Arcavacata di Rende, Italy. federica.menichini@unical.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Menichini", "ForeName": "Federica", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mudu", "ForeName": "Pierpaolo", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "9208369", "ISSNLinking": "1053-8569"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Respiratory System Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20927798", "10.1002/pds.2033"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
