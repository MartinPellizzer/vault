This study evaluated health burden and cost associated with the short-term and long-term exposure of major air pollutants (fine particulate matter [PM<sub>2.5</sub>] and ozone [O<sub>3</sub>]) during 2013-2018. We developed a database of gridded daily and annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposure in China at 15\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0km resolution. Then, we estimated the age- and cause-specific premature deaths and quantified related health damage with an age-adjusted value of statistical life (VSL) measure. The health cost estimated in this study captured direct cost, indirect cost and intangible cost of the premature death attributable to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. We found that the national premature deaths attributable to long-term and short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased by 15% and 59%, whereas the national premature deaths attributable to long-term and short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> increased by 36% and 94%. Despite a 15% reduction of attributable deaths, the health cost attributable to long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> did not change significantly as a result of GDP growth and population aging. On the other hand, the long-term O<sub>3</sub> related health cost in 2018 doubled that in 2013. Our study suggests that while premature deaths fell as a result of China's clean air actions, the health costs of air pollution remained high. The growing trends of O<sub>3</sub> highlighted the needs for strategies to reduce both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> emissions, for the sake of public health and social well-being in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
