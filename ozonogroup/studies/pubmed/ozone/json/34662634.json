The treatment process is composed of coagulation with aluminum hydroxide, flocculation, anthracite-sand filtration, and chlorination. Samples were also collected from pilot-scale biological filters consisting of anthracite-sand or granular activated carbon (GAC) media operated with or without pre-ozonation and at a range of different empty-bed contact times (EBCTs). Particles in 10\u00a0L water samples collected in duplicate using a fully enclosed sampling apparatus were separated using sieves with 500\u00a0\u03bcm, 300\u00a0\u03bcm, 125\u00a0\u03bcm, and 45\u00a0\u03bcm openings followed by filtration through 10\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate filters. Particles were counted using stereomicroscopy and characterized using \u03bc-Raman spectroscopy. Full-scale conventional treatment removed 52\u00a0% of anthropogenic particles when comparing raw (42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018 particles/L) and finished water (20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 particles/L). Coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation accounted for the highest removal (70\u00a0%) of any individual unit process. Overall removal was reduced to 52\u00a0%, the difference being attributed to airborne particle deposition that occurred while water was detained in a clearwell (exposed to atmosphere via ventilation) that was used to achieve the required contact time for disinfection. The majority of the particles (>80\u00a0%) were identified as fibers 10-45\u00a0\u03bcm; microplastics were predominantly composed of polyester while the non-plastic anthropogenic particles were primarily cellulose. None of the pilot filter configurations examined resulted in significantly fewer microplastics when compared to full-scale conventional filtration. This study illustrates that the removal efficiency of conventional treatment may be limited when considering microfibers <45\u00a0\u03bcm in size."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
