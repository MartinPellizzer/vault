Acid Red 27 decomposition rate followed the first-order reaction with complete dye discoloration in 20 min of ozone reaction. The dye decay rate increases as ozone dosage increases. Using Mn, Zn and Ni as transition metal catalysts during the ozone oxidation process, Mn displayed the greatest catalytic effect with significant increase in the rate of decomposition. The rate of decomposition decreases with increase in temperature and beyond 40 degrees C, increase in decomposition rate was followed by a corresponding increase in temperature. The FT-IR spectra in the range of 1,000-1,800 cm(-1) revealed specific band variations after the ozone oxidation process, portraying structural changes traceable to cleavage of bonds in the benzene ring, the sulphite salt group, and the C-N located beside the -N = N- bond. From the (1)H-NMR spectra, the breaking down of the benzene ring showed the disappearance of the 10 H peaks at 7-8 ppm, which later emerged with a new peak at 6.16 ppm. In a parallel batch test of azo dye Acid Red 27 adsorption onto activated carbon, a low adsorption capacity was observed in the adsorption test carried out after three minutes of ozone injection while the adsorption process without ozone injection yielded a high adsorption capacity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Ewha Women's University, Seoul, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beak", "ForeName": "Mi H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ijagbemi", "ForeName": "Christianah O", "Initials": "CO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong S", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "915-67-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Amaranth Dye"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amaranth Dye"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19337926", "10.1080/10934520902784708", "910061803"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
