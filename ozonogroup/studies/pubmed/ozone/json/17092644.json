The observed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics was justified through a combined direct ozone and indirect radical oxidation approach for the ozonation process. The BHA decay rates increased with the increase of the solution pH, but decreased as the NaCl concentration increased because of the consumption of ozone by chloride. A kinetic model was therefore derived for predicting BHA degradation at various initial pH levels and NaCl concentrations. For the O(3)/H(2)O(2) and O(3)/H(2)O(2)/Cl(-) processes, the rate of BHA removal was investigated at hydrogen peroxide concentration ranged from 0.5 to 5mM at pH 7. Different optimal H(2)O(2) dosages and decay rates were found for both processes due to the participation of reactions among O(3), H(2)O(2), OH* and Cl(-) as discussed in the paper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Research Centre for Environmental Technology and Management, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Horn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China. cewchu@polyu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25013-16-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Butylated Hydroxyanisole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Butylated Hydroxyanisole"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17092644", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.10.017", "S0304-3894(06)01211-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
