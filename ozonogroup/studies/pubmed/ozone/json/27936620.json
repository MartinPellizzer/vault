The concept is based on (i) the removal/formation of selected indicator substances and their transformation products (TPs), (ii) the assessment of ecotoxicity via in vitro tests, and (iii) the removal of pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria. It includes substances passing biological wastewater treatment plants regulated or proposed to be regulated in the European Water Framework Directive, TPs formed in biological processes or during ozonation, agonistic/antagonistic endocrine activities, mutagenic/genotoxic activities, cytotoxic activities, further activities like neurotoxicity as well as antibiotics resistance genes, and taxonomic gene markers for pathogens. At a pilot plant, ozonation of conventionally treated wastewater resulted in the removal of micropollutants and pathogens and the reduction of estrogenic effects, whereas the in vitro mutagenicity increased. Subsequent post-treatment of the ozonated water by granular activated carbon (GAC) significantly reduced the mutagenic effects as well as the concentrations of remaining micropollutants, whereas this was not the case for biofiltration. The results demonstrate the suitability of the evaluation concept to assess processes of advanced wastewater treatment including ozonation and GAC by considering chemical, ecotoxicological, and microbiological parameters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) , Am Mainzer Tor 1, D-56068 Koblenz, Germany."}], "LastName": "Ternes", "ForeName": "Thomas A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) , Am Mainzer Tor 1, D-56068 Koblenz, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley , 406 O'Brien Hall, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Prasse", "ForeName": "Carsten", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) , Am Mainzer Tor 1, D-56068 Koblenz, Germany."}], "LastName": "Eversloh", "ForeName": "Christian L\u00fctke", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute IWAR, Department Wastewater Technology and Water Reuse, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt , Franziska-Braun-Stra\u00dfe 7, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany."}], "LastName": "Knopp", "ForeName": "Gregor", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute IWAR, Department Wastewater Technology and Water Reuse, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt , Franziska-Braun-Stra\u00dfe 7, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany."}], "LastName": "Cornel", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Aquatic Ecotoxicology, Goethe University Frankfurt , 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schulte-Oehlmann", "ForeName": "Ulrike", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)-Campus North, Institute of Functional Interfaces (IFG) , Bioengineering and Biosystems Department, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)-Campus North, Institute of Functional Interfaces (IFG) , Bioengineering and Biosystems Department, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zweckverband Landeswasserversorgung , 89129 Langenau, Germany."}], "LastName": "Seitz", "ForeName": "Wolfram", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ECT Oekotoxikologie GmbH , 65439 Fl\u00f6rsheim, Germany."}], "LastName": "Coors", "ForeName": "Anja", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Aquatic Ecotoxicology, Goethe University Frankfurt , 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany."}], "LastName": "Oehlmann", "ForeName": "J\u00f6rg", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecotoxicology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27936620", "10.1021/acs.est.6b04855"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
