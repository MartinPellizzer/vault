This is paradoxical because emissions of O3 precursors (hydrocarbons, CO, and nitrogen oxides [NOx]) are lower on weekends. Day-of-week emissions activity data were collected and analyzed to investigate the hypothesized causes of the \"weekend O3 effect.\" Emission activity data were collected for various mobile, area, and point sources throughout the SoCAB, including on-road vehicles, lawn and garden equipment, barbecues, fireplaces, solvent use, and point sources with continuous emission monitoring data. The results of this study indicate significant differences between weekday and weekend emission activity patterns and emissions. Their combined effect results in a 12-18% decrease in reactive organic gases (ROGs) and a 35-41% decrease in NOx emissions on Saturdays and Sundays, respectively, relative to weekdays in summer 2000. These changes in emissions result in an increase of more than 30% in the ROG/NOx ratio on weekends compared with weekdays, which, along with lower NOx emissions, leads to increased O3 production on weekends."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sonoma Technology, Inc., Petaluma, California 94954, USA. lyle@sonomatech.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chinkin", "ForeName": "Lyle R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coe", "ForeName": "Dana L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Funk", "ForeName": "Tami H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hafner", "ForeName": "Hilary R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roberts", "ForeName": "Paul T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryan", "ForeName": "Patrick A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawson", "ForeName": "Douglas R", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12880071", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466223"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
