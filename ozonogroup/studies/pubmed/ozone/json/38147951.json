OH plays a critical role in the formation of secondary pollutants like ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) via various oxidation reactions. Despite the abundance of recent HONO studies, research on national HONO emissions in China remains relatively limited. Therefore, this study employed a \"wetting-drying\" model and bottom-up approach to develop a high-resolution gridded inventory of HONO emissions for mainland China using multiple data. We used the Monte Carlo method to estimate the uncertainty in HONO emissions. In addition, the primary sources of HONO emissions were identified and their spatiotemporal distribution and main influencing factors were studied. The results indicated that the total HONO emissions in mainland China in 2016 were 0.77\u00a0Tg\u00a0N (R<sub>50</sub>: 0.28-1.42\u00a0Tg\u00a0N), with soil (0.42\u00a0Tg\u00a0N) and fertilization (0.26\u00a0Tg\u00a0N) as the primary sources, jointly contributing to over 87% of the total. Notably, the North China Plain (NCP) had the highest HONO emission density (3.51\u00a0kg\u00a0N/ha/yr). Seasonal HONO emissions followed the order: summer (0.38\u00a0kg\u00a0N/ha)\u00a0>\u00a0spring (0.19\u00a0kg\u00a0N/ha)\u00a0>\u00a0autumn (0.17\u00a0kg\u00a0N/ha)\u00a0>\u00a0winter (0.06\u00a0kg\u00a0N/ha). Moreover, HONO emissions were strongly correlated with fertilization, cropland, temperature, and precipitation. This study provides vital scientific groundwork for the atmospheric nitrogen cycle and the formation of secondary pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
