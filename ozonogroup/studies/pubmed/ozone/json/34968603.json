In this study, we developed a solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) method for the analysis of 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP), 5'-uridine monophosphate (UMP), 5'-cytidine monophosphate (CMP) and 5'-guanosine monophosphate (GMP). The method achieved limits of detection (LODs) of 0.1-1.0\u00a0ng/L, and recoveries of 85-95% for the four tested nucleotides. The occurrence and concentrations of the four nucleotides in water from eight representative drinking water treatment and distribution systems in China were determined using this method. All four nucleotides were detectable in water treatment plant (WTP) influent and effluent, at concentrations of up to 30\u00a0ng/L and with occurrence frequency of around 90%. The concentrations of identified nucleotides increased 3-10 times after 10\u00a0km of water age in the water distribution system. Biological filters and coagulation increased the concentrations of nucleotides, conversely, active carbon, ozonation, and ultrafiltration membrane removed nucleotides in water. The effects of active carbon and coagulation were further confirmed using laboratory-controlled experiment. In addition, monochlorinated nucleotides were identified as the chlorination products of nucleotides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
