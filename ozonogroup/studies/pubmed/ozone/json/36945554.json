Urban areas juxtapose large numbers of residences and workplaces with near-road environments, exacerbating traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure. TRAP is the primary source of variability in intraurban air quality, but continuous regulatory monitoring stations lack the spatial resolution to detect fine-scale pollutant patterns that recent studies using long-term, resource-intensive mobile measurements have established as persistent and associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events. This work evaluates a low-cost, fixed-site approach to characterizinglong-term, hyperlocal exposure to oxides of nitrogen (including NO <sub>2</sub> , a common surrogate for TRAP) as part of Green Heart Louisville, a prospective cohort study examining linkages between urban vegetation, local air quality, and cardiovascular health. We used a fixed 60-site network of Ogawa passive samplers in a 12 km <sup>2</sup> section of Louisville, KY, to measure two-week integrated NO <sub>2</sub> , NO <sub>x</sub> (NO + NO <sub>2</sub> ), and O <sub>3</sub> mixing ratios nominally every two months between May 2018-March 2021. Seasonal NO <sub>x</sub> averages were 2.5-fold higher during winter than in summer, and annual average NO (calculated by difference in NO <sub>x</sub> and NO <sub>2</sub> ) and NO <sub>2</sub> ranged from 4-21 ppb and 5-12 ppb, respectively. NO increased 3-to-5-fold within 150 m of highways or major arterial roads and 2-to-3-fold near parking lots. While both NO and NO <sub>2</sub> were elevated in near-road environments, the corresponding O <sub>3</sub> was depressed, consistent with titration by NO. We developed land-use regression models for annual average NO, NO <sub>2</sub> , and NO <sub>x</sub> using parameters of proximity (distance to nearest road type, restaurant, traffic signal), cumulative occurrence (length of roads, number of restaurants and traffic lights, all in buffers of up to 500 m in 50-m increments), and greenness (normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI)). Adjusted spatial variability explained by the models were 70% (p<0.05), 67% (p<0.05), and 75% (p<0.01) for NO, NO <sub>2</sub> , and NO <sub>x</sub> , respectively. Common predictors were distances to the nearest restaurant and road as well as total length of roads within 350 m. Only one greenness metric was significant: mean NDVI within 50 m was negatively associated (p=0.02) with NO <sub>2</sub> . We plan to use these hyperlocal models to estimate residential-level exposures of the clinical study participants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prathibha", "ForeName": "Pradeep", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yeager", "ForeName": "Raymond", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhatnagar", "ForeName": "Aruni", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Turner", "ForeName": "Jay", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Preprint"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "medRxiv", "NlmUniqueID": "101767986"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "57"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36945554", "PMC10029020", "10.1101/2023.03.03.23286765", "2023.03.03.23286765"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
