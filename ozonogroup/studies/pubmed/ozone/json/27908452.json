In this study, we investigated the reactions of ozone with DON with a special emphasis on the formation of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). In batch ozonation experiments, the formation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was investigated for natural organic matter standards, surface water, and wastewater effluent samples. A good correlation was found between NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation and the O<sub>3</sub> exposure (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.82) during ozonation of both model DON solutions and real water samples. To determine the main precursor of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, solutions composed of tannic acid and model compounds with amine functional groups were ozonated. The NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> yield during ozonation was significantly higher for glycine than for trimethylamine and dimethylamine. Experiments with glycine also showed that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was formed via an intermediate with a second-order rate constant of 7.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> while NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was formed by an electron-transfer mechanism with O<sub>3</sub> as confirmed from a hydroxyl radical (OH) yield of 24.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9%. The NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations, however, were lower than the OH yield (0.03\u00a0mol NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>/mol OH) suggesting other OH-producing reactions that compete with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> formation. This study concludes that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation during ozonation of DON is induced by an oxygen-transfer to nitrogen forming hydroxylamine and oxime, while NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> formation is induced by electron-transfer reactions involving C-centered radicals and imine intermediates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
