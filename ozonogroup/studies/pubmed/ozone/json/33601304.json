However, if this technology is to be widely adopted, reducing the energy consumption associated with ozone generation will be necessary. We used ultra-fine bubbles (UFBs) as ozone carriers to determine if their use could improve the efficiency of ozone treatment and reduce the ozone dose required. We used a spiral, liquid-type UFB generator, which can introduce UFBs directly into a sludge suspension. The death ratio of bacteria in sludge was used as an indicator of sludge reduction. The ozone requirement was reduced by UFBs. The ozone consumption required to achieve a death ratio of 80% was 15\u00a0mg-O<sub>3</sub>/g-MLSS in the sludge treated with ozone supplied by UFBs versus 25 and 45\u00a0mg-O<sub>3</sub>/g-MLSS in sludges treated with ozone supplied as a spiral, liquid-type microbubbles and by a diffuser, respectively. When mixing water ozonated with UFBs with sludge, the depth of the dead cell layer from the surface to the interior of the sludge floc was larger than that of ozonated water lacking UFBs at the same rate of ozone consumption. Ozone in UFBs kills bacteria inside the flocs. However, the fragmentation of sludge flocs by shear forces in the UFB generator made a larger contribution to the acceleration of bacterial death in sludge treated with ozone supplied by UFBs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
