In this study, we systematically mapped out the detailed reaction pathways of O<sub>3</sub> activation on 10 potential active sites of 8 representative configurations of N-DNCs, including the pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, N on edge, and porphyrinic N, based on the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT results indicate that O<sub>3</sub> decomposes into an adsorbed atomic oxygen species (O<sub>ads</sub>) and an <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> on the active sites. The atomic charge and spin population on the O<sub>ads</sub> species indicate that it may not only act as an initiator for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also directly attack the organics on the pyrrolic N. On the N site and C site of the N<sub>4</sub>V<sub>2</sub> system (quadri-pyridinic N with two vacancies) and the pyridinic N site at edge, O<sub>3</sub> could be activated into <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in addition to <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. The N<sub>4</sub>V<sub>2</sub> system was predicted to have the best activity among the N-DNCs studied. Based on the DFT results, machine learning models were utilized to correlate the O<sub>3</sub> activation activity with the local and global properties of the catalyst surfaces. Among the models, XGBoost performed the best, with the condensed dual descriptor being the most important feature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois 62901, United States."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Guangfei", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yiqiu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5968-9357"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Hongbin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6026-6693"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois 62901, United States."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Qingfeng", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Sihan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5592-9883"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Vanadium and Titanium Resources Comprehensive Utilization, Pangang Group Research Institute Company Limited, Panzhihua 617000, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yongbing", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35615937", "10.1021/acs.est.1c08666"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
