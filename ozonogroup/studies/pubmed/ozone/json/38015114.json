In a child-family-oriented approach, the best restorative treatment for a primary tooth could not be the proper one for the child as a whole. Preservation of dental tissues as much as possible, without involving the pulp, is called minimal intervention dentistry (MID) and it is closely related to \"selective caries removal\" and \"bioactive restorative materials\". To preserve the vitality of a tooth as much as possible, many tools are available on the market (i.e. silver diamine fluoride, ozone) and this could play an important role in a \"tailored fit treatment plan\" mindset.", "Minimally invasive direct restorative strategies in paediatric dentistry, is a predictable evidence-based-restorative option for the treatment of vital primary teeth with no need of local anaesthesia and absolute isolation. Beyond the clinical aspect, the clinician expertise is crucial to evaluate the required materials and tools, not only to perform a minimal invasive paediatric dentistry in a safe, efficient and child-friendly way, but for the wellness of all parties involved. In this life-related paradigm new bioactive restorative materials are among the main protagonists."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DDS, MS Ortho, MS Digital Dentistry, Adjunct Professor Postgraduate School of Orthodontics, University of Brescia, Private Practice in Varese, Italy."}], "LastName": "Beretta", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DDS, MS Ortho, Adjunct Professor Postgraduate School of Orthodontics, University of Brescia, Private Practice in Viadana, Italy."}], "LastName": "Federici Canova", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DDS, MS Paediatric Dentistry, Adjunct Professor School of Paediatric Dentistry, University of Cagliari, Private.
