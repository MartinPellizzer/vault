A commercially readily available waterborne silica sol mixed with waterborne acrylate latex was creatively utilized as the binder. A series of coating samples were prepared by spray coating method and evaluated focusing on their adhesion strength and catalytic activity towards ozone decomposition in an air duct at room temperature, by varying MnO<sub>2</sub>/binder mass ratio and number of sprayings. It was found that the adhesion strength of the catalytic coatings on the aluminum honeycomb increased with the increase of binder mass ratio, but the increased binder made the catalyst particles closely packed, resulting in reduced exposure of active sites and decrease of ozone conversion. Accordingly, catalyst slurry with 81.8 wt.% MnO<sub>2</sub> in dry coating and spraying times of two were determined as the optimal process parameters. As-prepared aluminum honeycomb filter with MnO<sub>2</sub> layer of 50\u00a0\u00b5m thickness achieved ozone conversion of 29.3%\u00b11.7% under conditions of air velocity 3.0\u00a0m/sec, relative humidity \u223c50%, room temperature (26\u00b0C) and initial ozone concentration of 200\u00a0ppbV. This filter can be well adaptable to indoor air purification equipment operating at high air velocity with low wind resistance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
