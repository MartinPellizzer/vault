It was clear that the use of TiO2 under 254+185 nm light irradiation significantly enhanced the photodegradation of toluene relative to UV alone, owed to the combined effect of photochemical oxidation in the gas phase and photocatalytic oxidation on TiO2. The photodegradation with 254+185 nm light irradiation was compared with other UV wavelengths (365 nm (black light blue lamp) and 254 nm (germicidal UV lamp)). The highest conversion and mineralization were obtained with the 254+185 nm light. Moreover, high conversions were achieved even at high initial concentrations of toluene. Catalyst deactivation was also prevented with the 254+185 nm light. Regeneration experiments with the deactivated catalyst under different conditions revealed that reactive oxygen species played an important role in preventing catalyst deactivation by decomposing effectively the less reactive carbon deposits on the TiO2 catalyst. Simultaneous elimination of photogenerated excess ozone and residual organic compounds was accomplished by using a MnO2 ozone-decomposition catalyst to form reactive species for destruction of the organic compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Human Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, 255 Shimo-Okubo, Sakura, Saitama 338-8570, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Juyoung", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sekiguchi", "ForeName": "Kazuhiko", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Kazuhiko", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15488929", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.05.037", "S0045-6535(04)00474-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
