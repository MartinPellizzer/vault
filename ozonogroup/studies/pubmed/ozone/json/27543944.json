The plants were exposed to E-O<sub>3</sub> at 1.5 times the ambient ozone concentration (A-O<sub>3</sub>) from the initiation of tillering to final harvest. Pigments, gas exchange rates, chlorophyll a fluorescence, antioxidants contents, antioxidative enzyme activity and lipid oxidation were measured in three replicated plots throughout flag leaf development. Results showed that significant O<sub>3</sub> effects on most variables were only found during the mid-grain filling stage. Across five cultivars, E-O<sub>3</sub> significantly accelerated leaf senescence, as indicated by increased lipid oxidation as well as faster declines in pigment amounts and photosynthetic rates. The lower photosynthetic rates were mainly due to non-stomatal factors, e.g. lower maximum carboxylation capacity and electron transport rates. There were strong interactions between O<sub>3</sub> and cultivar in photosynthetic pigments, light-saturated photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll a fluorescence with O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive (Y19, Y2 and Y15) and O<sub>3</sub>-tolerant (J2, Y16) cultivars being clearly differentiated in their responses to E-O<sub>3</sub>. E-O<sub>3</sub> significantly influenced the antioxidative enzymes but not antioxidant contents. Significant interactions between O<sub>3</sub> and cultivar were found in antioxidative enzymes, such as SOD and CAT, but not in stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>). Therefore, it can be concluded that antioxidative enzymes rather than g<sub>s</sub> or antioxidants are responsible for the differential responses to E-O<sub>3</sub> among cultivars. These findings provide important information for the development of accurate modeling O<sub>3</sub> effects on crops, especially with respect to the developmental stage when O<sub>3</sub> damage to photosynthesis becomes manifest."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
