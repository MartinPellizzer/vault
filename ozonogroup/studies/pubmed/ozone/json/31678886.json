Char-clay composite derived from refinery spent bleaching earth (SBE) is an economical and readily available catalyst that can be used during the ozonation treatment of recalcitrants in wastewater. Four catalysts of SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-650, SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-850, SBE-O<sub>2</sub>-650, and SBE-O<sub>2</sub>-850 were prepared by heating the SBE at 650 and 850\u202f\u00b0C under N<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> conditions. High surface OH sites in the SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-650 and SBE-O<sub>2</sub>-650 relative to the SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-850 and SBE-O<sub>2</sub>-850 resulted in an increase in catalytic activity. Additional carbon (C), that existed in the SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-650 and SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-850, had a positive effect on catalytic activity. The SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-650 exhibited the highest activity among those prepared catalysts. During catalytic ozonation, the SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-650 increased the mineralization rate of benzoic acid by 36% when compared with single ozonation. Molecular ozone was decomposed at the surface active sites on SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-650, generating active \u2022OH, \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, or <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> species. Gas and liquid products having calorific values that are generated during SBE-N<sub>2</sub>-650 preparation can be further utilized. This study introduces a potential use of SBE for the ozonation treatment of recalcitrant wastewaters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
