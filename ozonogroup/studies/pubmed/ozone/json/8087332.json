We ascertained whether preliminary exposure to 0.6 parts per million (ppm) NO2 would affect the lung function response to subsequent exposure to 0.3 ppm O3. Twenty-one healthy young nonsmoking women (18 to 35 yr of age) underwent two sets of exposures on two different days separated by a minimum of 2 wk. On one day, subjects were exposed to air for 2 h followed 3 h later by a 2-h exposure to O3. On the other day, the first exposure was to NO2; order of the days was randomized. During each exposure subjects intermittently exercised, alternating 15 min of rest with 15 min of exercise (Ve approximately 40 L/min). Spirometry was performed before the first exposure and at 1-h intervals until the end of the 2-h (O3) exposure. Plethysmography measurements were made before and after NO2 and O3 exposures. Nonspecific airway reactivity (AR) was determined at least 1 wk prior to the first exposure and following each O3 exposure. AR to methacholine (MCh) was expressed as dose required to decrease FEV1 by 10% (PD10FEV1). Nitrogen dioxide exposure alone did not reduce FEV1 but did significantly enhance O3-induced spirometric changes. No significant effects were observed in plethysmography. On both exposure days, the median PD10FEV1 was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) from control PD10FEV1 (14.3 mg/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7310."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hazucha", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seal", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bromberg", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8087332", "10.1164/ajrccm.150.3.8087332"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
