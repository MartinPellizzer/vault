Ambient air samples, collected using Summa Canisters and DNPH sampling columns at three observation sites in the main urban area, were used to study the composition, photochemical reaction activity, and source apportionment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the period of O<sub>3</sub> pollution. The results showed that the mean volume fraction of TVOCs in the main urban area of Chongqing during the observation period was 45.08\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and the components were ranked by volume fraction in the following order:OVOCs, alkanes, halohydrocarbons, alkenes, aromatics, and alkynes. Formaldehyde, ethylene, and acetone made up the higher volume fraction of VOCs, together accounting for more than 30% of TVOCs. OVOCs and alkenes contributed more to \u00b7 OH loss rate (<i>L</i><sub>i</sub><sup>\u00b7OH</sup>) and ozone formation potential (OFP) and were the key VOCs components for ozone generation. The main active species in the OVOCs component were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein; the main active species in the alkene component were isoprene, ethylene, and <i>n</i>-butene. The ratio of xylene to ethylbenzene in VOCs was low, and they showed a significant correlation, indicating that the VOCs air mass in the main urban area was highly aging and affected by long-distance transmission from other areas. The source apportionment results of the PMF model showed five main sources of VOCs, namely secondary generation (27.67%), vehicle exhaust (26.56%), industrial emission (17.86%), plant (14.51%), and fossil fuel combustion (13.4%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhen-Liang", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Wei-Kai", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Lin-Feng", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Pei-Li", "Initials": "PL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Feng-Wen", "Initials": "FW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Chong-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34309246", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202101119"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
