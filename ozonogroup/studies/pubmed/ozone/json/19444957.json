However, very few studies have documented the effects on postnatal development of O3 during pregnancy. The long-term effects of prenatal O3 exposure in rats (0.5 ppm 12 h/day from embryonic day E5 to E20) were evaluated in the adult nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) regulating respiratory control. Neuronal response was assessed by Fos protein immunolabeling (Fos-IR), and catecholaminergic neuron involvement by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) labeling (TH-IR). Adult offspring were analyzed at baseline and following immobilization stress (one hour, plus two hours' recovery); immunolabeling was observed by confocal microscopy. Prenatal O3 increased the baseline TH gray level per cell (p < 0.001). In contrast, the number of Fos-IR cells, Fos-IR/TH-IR colabeled cells and proportion of TH double-labeled with Fos remained unchanged. After stress, the TH gray level (p < 0.001), number of Fos-IR cells (p < 0.001) and of colabeled Fos-IR/TH-IR cells (p < 0.05) and percentage of colabeled Fos-IR/TH-IR neurons against TH-IR cells (p < 0.05) increased in the control group. In prenatal-O3 rats, immobilization stress abolished these increases and reduced the TH gray level (p < 0.05), indicating that prenatal O3 led to loss of adult NTS reactivity to stress. We conclude that long-lasting sequelae were detected in the offspring beyond the prenatal O3 exposure. Prenatal O3 left a print on the NTS, revealed by stress. Disruption of neuronal plasticity to new challenge might be suggested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, F-69003, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boussouar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Araneda", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamelin", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soulage", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitahama", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalmaz", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Neurosci Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600130", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3940"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oncogene Proteins v-fos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.16.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oncogene Proteins v-fos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Restraint, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Solitary Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19444957", "10.1016/j.neulet.2009.01.027", "S0304-3940(09)00008-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
