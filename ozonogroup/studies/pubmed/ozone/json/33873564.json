Antisense inhibition of these ethylene (C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> ) biosynthetic genes allowed us to examine the relationship between O<sub>3</sub> -induced C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> emission and foliar injury. \u2022\u2002 Thirty-two lines (antisense for ST-ACS4 or ST-ACS5) were screened in the glasshouse for acute O<sub>3</sub> -induced C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> and lesions. Stomatal conductance and ACS transcripts were quantified for selected C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> -altered lines. Six lines were field-tested for chronic O<sub>3</sub> effects. \u2022\u2002 Ten lines produced less, and four lines produced more, acute-O<sub>3</sub> -induced C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> than nontransformed (NT) plants. Ethylene levels did not appear to be correlated with stomatal conductance. ST-ACS4 and -5 transcript were reduced in transgenic plants, except in two C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> over-producing lines. In the field, these C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> over-producing lines displayed stunting and leaf rolling in charcoal-filtered (CF) air and chronic O<sub>3</sub> , and they sustained the most severe O<sub>3</sub> injury. \u2022\u2002 When C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> production was strongly suppressed or enhanced, corresponding reductions or increases in lesion severity were observed, suggesting a critical role for C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> in the lesion formation process during O<sub>3</sub> stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sinn", "ForeName": "Judith P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlagnhaufer", "ForeName": "Carl D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arteca", "ForeName": "Richard N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "Eva J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Arteca RN. 1982.
