This registry has produced reliable epidemiological data from a large non-selected population.", "During the 20-year study period, 3142 ischemic strokes, 341 primary cerebral hemorrhages and 74 subarachnoid hemorrhages were recorded. Age at first stroke rose by five years in men and eight years in women.", "Comparing the descriptive epidemiology data between 1985 to 1989 and the 2000-2004 periods, the following results were noted: age- and sex-standardized incidences of first-ever stroke were stable except for lacunar stroke where the incidence increased significantly (p=0.05), and for cardioembolic stroke where incidence decreased significantly (p=0.01); 28-day case-fatality rates decreased significantly mainly for lacunar stroke (p=0.05) and for primary cerebral hemorrhage (p=0.03). The proportion of subjects with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes increased significantly (p<0.01). Analysis of cohort data issuing from the registry yielded the following findings: hyperglycemia during the acute stage of cerebral infarct was linked with poor prognosis; lower levels of E. apolipoprotein linked to HDL-cholesterol were associated with atherothrombotic infarcts; activation of coagulation factors was linked with atherothrombotic infarct; decreased N-acetyl-aspartate, a marker of the number of neurons, and increased serum lactate, a marker of anaerobic metabolism measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were noted in the cohort of cerebral infarct victims; release of platelet V-glycoprotein was noted in cerebral infarct; the incidence of cerebral infarct rose during autumn and during periods with high levels of atmospheric ozone and was higher in male smokers aged more than 40 years with hypertension. The population-based registry contributed to the assessment of medicoeconomic expenditures and professional practices.", "In Dijon, age- and sex-standardized stroke incidence has remained stable over the past 20 years. Increasing age at first-ever stroke, decreasing case-fatality rate, increasing use of antiplatelet treatments and a reduction in certain prestroke risk factors were noted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Registre dijonnais des AVC, Institut de Veille-Sanitaire, EA4184, universit\u00e9 de Bourges, facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine, B.P. 1519, 21033 Dijon cedex, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bejot", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rouaud", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benatru", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fromont", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Couvreur", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caillier", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gentil", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osseby", "ForeName": "G V", "Initials": "GV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lemesle", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Decavel", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medeiros", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreau", "ForeName": "Th", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giroud", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Les apports du registre dijonnais des accidents vasculaires c\u00e9r\u00e9braux en 20 ans d'activit\u00e9."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Rev Neurol (Paris)", "NlmUniqueID": "2984779R", "ISSNLinking": "0035-3787"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Registries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18358872", "10.1016/j.neurol.2007.06.003", "S0035-3787(07)00026-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
