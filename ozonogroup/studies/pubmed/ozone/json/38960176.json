Using various synoptic weather patterns (SWPs), we quantitatively assessed the variations in the PO, which is relevant to formulating policies aimed at controlling complex pollution in the air. First, based on one-year sampling data from March 2018 to February 2019, the SWPs classification of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) was conducted using the sum-of-squares technique (SS). Five dominant SWPs can be found in the YRD region, including the Aleutian low under SWP1 (occurring 45\u00a0% of the year), a tropical cyclone under SWP2 (21\u00a0%), the tropical cyclone and western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) under SWP3 (15.4\u00a0%), the WPSH under SWP4 (6.9\u00a0%), and a continental high pressure under SWP5 (3.1\u00a0%). The phenomenon of a \"seesaw\" between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, which was influenced by meteorological mechanisms. Second, the multi-linear regression (MLR) model and the partial correlation (PCOR) analysis were employed to quantify the effects of dominant components and meteorological factors on the PO. Meteorological variables could collectively explain only 33.0\u00a0% of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> variations, but 58.0\u00a0% for O<sub>3</sub>. O<sub>3</sub> promoted each other with low concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> but was inhibited by high concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. High relative humidity (RH) was conducive to the generation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> secondary components and enhanced the radiative effects of aerosols and the negative correlation of PO. In addition, attention should be paid to assessing the combined effects of precursor levels, weather, and chemical reactions on the particle-ozone complex pollution. The control of O<sub>3</sub> pollutants should be intensified in summer, while the focus should be on reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollutants in winter. Prevention and control measures need to reflect the differences in weather conditions and pollution characteristics, with a focus on RH and secondary components of PM<sub>2.5</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
