PM-mediated activation of two major activation pathways of coagulation provides a potential mechanism for the observed association between PM and cardiovascular disease. However, it remains unclear which specific characteristics and components of air pollution are responsible.", "In order to investigate those characteristics and components, we semiexperimentally exposed healthy adult volunteers at five different locations with increased contrasts and reduced correlations among PM characteristics. Volunteers were exposed for 5 h, exercising intermittently, 3-7 times at different sites from March to October 2009. On site, we measured PM mass and number concentration, its oxidative potential (OP), content of elemental/organic carbon, trace metals, sulphate, nitrate and gaseous pollutants (ozone, nitrogen oxides). Before and 2 and 18 h after exposure we sampled blood from the participants and measured thrombin generation using the calibrated automated thrombogram.", "We found that thrombin generation increases in the intrinsic (FXII-mediated) blood coagulation pathway in relation to ambient air pollution exposure. The associations with NO2, nitrate and sulphate were consistent and robust, insensitive to adjustment for other pollutants. The associations with tissue factor-mediated thrombogenicity were not very consistent.", "Ex vivo thrombin generation was associated with exposure to NO2, nitrate and sulphate, but not PM mass, PM OP or other measured air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Environmental Health (MGO), National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Strak", "ForeName": "Maciej", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoek", "ForeName": "Gerard", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steenhof", "ForeName": "Maaike", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kilinc", "ForeName": "Evren", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Godri", "ForeName": "Krystal J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gosens", "ForeName": "Ilse", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mudway", "ForeName": "Ian S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Oerle", "ForeName": "Ren\u00e9", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spronk", "ForeName": "Henri M H", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cassee", "ForeName": "Flemming R", "Initials": "FR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "Frank J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harrison", "ForeName": "Roy M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brunekreef", "ForeName": "Bert", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lebret", "ForeName": "Erik", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janssen", "ForeName": "Nicole A H", "Initials": "NA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "G0801056", "Acronym": "MRC_", "Agency": "Medical Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9422759", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Thrombin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23378445", "10.1136/oemed-2012-100992", "oemed-2012-100992"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
