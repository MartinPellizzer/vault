It was observed the performance order for removal of phenol and COD was Mn/HZSM-5 > Fe/HZSM-5 > Cu/HZSM-5 > Ti/HZSM-5 > HZSM-5. The presence of metals on HZSM-5 enhanced the phenol removal capability of HZSM-5. Mn loading on HZSM-5 was optimized due to its high phenol removal capability amongst metal-loaded HZSM-5 catalysts. Experimental results suggested that low amount of Mn loading on HZSM-5 was sufficient for HZSM-5 to act as catalyst and adsorbent. A maximum of 95.8 wt% phenols and 70.2 wt% COD were removed over 2 wt% Mn/HZSM-5 in 120 min. It was supposed that transition metals mainly acted as ozone decomposers due to their multiple oxidation states that enhanced the ozonation of phenol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Reaction Engineering Group, Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310 UTM Skudai, Johor Darul Takzim, Malaysia. noraishah@fkkksa.utm.my"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amin", "ForeName": "Nor Aishah Saidina", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Javaid", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "339NCG44TV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21866764", "10.2166/wst.2011.313"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
