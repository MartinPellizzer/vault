Forty patients with stable psoriasis vulgaris were enrolled in the study, whose lesions were symmetrical and involvement areas were <30% body surface. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Patients with left lesions served as a test group were treated daily for ozonated oil twice, and patients with right lesions served as a control group were treated daily for compound flumetasone ointment twice. The patients in the 2 groups were treated for 4 weeks. The clinical efficacy and safety were observed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after the treatment.\u2029 Results: After 1 week treatment, the effective rates of the test group and the control group were 60.58% and 72.28%, respectively, with significant difference between them (P<0.05). At 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the treatment, the efficacy in the test group was similar to that in the control group. The effective rates in the test group and the control group were 69.84% and 70.25% after 2 weeks, respectively, 70.88% and 71.23% after 4 weeks, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P<0.05). In addition, the reflectance confocal microscope results in both the test group and the control group after 4 weeks showed that the epidermis was approximately normal. There were few inflammatory cells infiltration in the dermal papilla, and the inflammatory cells infiltration was significantly reduced after treatment.\u2029 Conclusion: Ozonated oil treatment for stable psoriasis is safe and effective, and its efficacy is equivalent to the effect of glucocorticoid topical preparations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jianyun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban", "NlmUniqueID": "101230586", "ISSNLinking": "1672-7347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXC9231JVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcitriol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LR3CD8SX89", "NameOfSubstance": "Flumethasone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcitriol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Administration Schedule"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Flumethasone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29559602", "10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2018.02.012"]}}]}
