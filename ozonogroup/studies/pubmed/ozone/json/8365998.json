A single study in humans has also shown that mucociliary transport increases during acute ozone exposure. Because different responses have shown a different time course of recovery after exposure, it was important to examine mucociliary transport at a different time after the cessation of ozone exposure. We exposed 15 healthy male and female nonsmoking subjects, on different occasions, to clean air and 0.4 ppm ozone for 1 h while they exercised continuously. Pulmonary function was measured immediately before and after exposure and 90 min and 24 h after exposure. Between 2 and 5 h after each exposure, retention of inhaled 5-microns mass median aerodynamic diameter 99mTc-labeled Fe2O3 particles was measured. Each subject returned the next day for a final particle retention measurement. Despite significant changes in pulmonary function, there was no difference in mean whole lung retention time of particles between clean air [77.9 +/- 0.8 (SE) min] and ozone (78.0 +/- 0.8 min) exposures, indicating that mucociliary transport is unaffected by ozone exposure when it is measured 2 h after exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Branch, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerrity", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bennett", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kehrl", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeWitt", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mucociliary Clearance"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8365998", "10.1152/jappl.1993.74.6.2984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
