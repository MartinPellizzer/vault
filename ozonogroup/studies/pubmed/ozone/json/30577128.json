Previously we found intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and isoprene emission were affected by the combination of O<sub>3</sub> and drought, but the molecular mechanisms controlling these phenotypes are still open questions. In this study, we investigated the stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>) and transcriptome changes in an O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive hybrid poplar exposed to two O<sub>3</sub> levels [charcoal-filtered ambient air (CF) and non-filtered ambient air plus 40\u202fppb (NF40)] and two water conditions [well-watered (W) and moderate drought (D)]. NF40 reduced the g<sub>s</sub> more under D than W. We identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from pairwise comparisons and found the poplar's molecular response to drought was counteracted by elevated O<sub>3</sub>. From nine clusters obtained through K-means clustering, 12 core transcription factors were identified. DEGs involved in isoprene biosynthesis and phytohormones signal pathways indicate the molecular response and stomatal closure of poplar under O<sub>3</sub> and/or drought might be through MEP/DOXP and ABA-dependent pathways. In addition, 102 Helitrons capturing DEGs were involved in response to O<sub>3</sub> and/or drought and related with ABA-dependent pathway. This integrated analysis provides multi-dimensional insights to understand the molecular response to the combination of O<sub>3</sub> and drought."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
