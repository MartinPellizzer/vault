Thus, it is essential to unveil the missing OH reactivity for developing an effective ozone mitigation strategy. In this study, we conducted simultaneous observations of total OH reactivity and 54 reactive trace species in a suburban area as part of the Air QUAlity Study (AQUAS)-Tsukuba campaign for the summer of 2017 to gain in-depth insight into total OH reactivity in an area that experienced relatively high contributions of secondary pollutants. The campaign identified on average 35.3% of missing OH reactivity among total OH reactivity (12.9\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>). In general, ozone-production potential estimation categorized ozone formation in this area as volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited conditions, and missing OH reactivity may increase ozone production potential 40% on average if considered. Our results suggest the importance of photochemical processes of both AVOCs and BVOCs for the production of missing OH reactivity and that we may underestimate the importance of reducing precursors in approach to suppressing ozone production if we ignore the contribution of their photochemical products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
