The trees were exposed to two levels of ozone: charcoal filtered air and non-filtered air to which 30 nl I<sup>-1</sup> of ozone was added in three consecutive years from 1988 to 1990, daily from May to September (8 hours a day). Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration and chlorophyll fluorescence were studied on selected days. Significant decreases in net photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence (F<sub>N</sub> /F<sub>M</sub> ) were found during periods with co-occurrence of high ozone concentrations And high light intensities, indicating interactions between effects of ozone and photoinhibition. After termination of fumigation enhanced rates of photosynthesis were seen in the trees which had been exposed to ozone. A significant decrease in F<sub>N</sub> /F<sub>M</sub> was found for twigs from ozone treated trees when exposed to severe desiccation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Ecology, Botanical Institute, University of Copenhagen, \u00d8uter Farimagsgade 2D, 1353 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mikkelsen", "ForeName": "T N", "Initials": "TN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Ecology, Botanical Institute, University of Copenhagen, \u00d8uter Farimagsgade 2D, 1353 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ro-Poulsen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Adams WW III, Diaz M, Winter K. 1989.
