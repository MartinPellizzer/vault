We collected air pollutant data including particulate matter \u22642.5\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter \u226410\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) from China National Environmental Monitoring Centre during the same period. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models to determine the associations.", "A 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> was associated with a significant increase in hospital outpatient visits for mental disorders on the current day. When stratified by age, sex and season, the effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were robust among different subgroups at lag05 days. PM<sub>10</sub> showed positive associations in males, in cold season, and in depression patients. SO<sub>2</sub> showed positive associations in males, in cold season, and in anxiety patients. O<sub>3</sub> showed positive associations in females, in warm season, and in depression patients. Nearly one sixth hospital outpatient visits for mental disorders can be attributable to NO<sub>2</sub>.", "Short-term increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations was significantly associated with exacerbation of mental disorders in China as indicated by increases in hospital outpatient visits. NO<sub>2</sub> had more serious health threat than other pollutants in terms of mental disorders. Our findings strongly suggest a need for more strict emission control regulations to protect mental health from air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
