The continuous record dated from 1936 to 2007, covers the periods prior to and during the major atmospheric releases of organic chlorine species that affected the stratospheric ozone levels. Concentrations and yearly fluxes of perchlorate and chloride showed a significant correlation for the 1940-1959 period, suggesting a predominant tropospheric formation by lightning. While concentration of chloride remained unchanged from 1940s until 2009, elevated levels of perchlorate were observed after 1979. A lack of significant increases in either sulfate or chloride between 1980 and 2001 suggests that the effect of volcanic activities on the perchlorate at the study site during this period could be insignificant. Therefore, the elevated perchlorate in the ice could most likely be attributed to anthropogenic activities that influenced perchlorate sources and formation mechanisms after 1979. Our results show that anthropogenic contribution could be responsible for 66% of perchlorate found in the ice. Although with some differences in trends and amounts, deposition rate found in this study is similar to those observed at Devon Island (Nunavut, Canada), Eclipse Icefield (Yukon, Canada) and Summit Station (Greenland). Methyl chloroform, a chlorinated solvent largely used after 1976, peaked in the atmosphere in 1990 and has a much shorter atmospheric life than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). This study proposes methyl chloroform (CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>) as the significant anthropogenic source of perchlorate in the Canadian High Arctic between 1980 and 2000, with HCFC-141b (Cl<sub>2</sub>FC-CH<sub>3</sub>), a relatively short-lived CFC probably responsible for a slower decrease in perchlorate deposition after the late 1990s. The presence of aerosols in the stratosphere appears to suppress perchlorate production after 1974. As both methyl chloroform and HCFC-141b had no new significant emissions after 2003, deposition of perchlorate in High Arctic is expected to remain at pre-1980 levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2340-3614"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, 125 Resources Road, Toronto, Ontario M9P 3V6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Furdui", "ForeName": "Vasile I", "Initials": "VI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geological Survey Canada, LMS, Natural Resources Canada , Ottawa, K1A 0E8, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Ottawa , Ottawa, K1N 6N5, Canada."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jiancheng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, 125 Resources Road, Toronto, Ontario M9P 3V6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Furdui", "ForeName": "Andreea", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Perchlorates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nunavut"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perchlorates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yukon Territory"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29271196", "10.1021/acs.est.7b03132"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
