Numerous studies have shown photocatalytic and electrocatalytic oxidation to be very effective for the removal of BPA, particularly in the addition of graphene/graphene oxide (GO)-based nanocatalysts. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation of BPA in aqueous solutions has not been reviewed. Therefore, this review gives a comprehensive understanding of BPA degradation during photo-/electro-catalytic activity in the presence of graphene/GO-based nanocatalysts. Herein, this review evaluated the main photo-/electro-catalytic degradation mechanisms and pathways for BPA removal under various water quality/chemistry conditions (pH, background ions, natural organic matter, promotors, and scavengers), the physicochemical characteristics of various graphene/GO-based nanocatalysts, and various operating conditions (voltage and current). Additionally, the reusability/stability of graphene/GO-based nanocatalysts, hybrid systems combined with ozone/ultrasonic/Fenton oxidation, and prospective research areas are briefly described."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
