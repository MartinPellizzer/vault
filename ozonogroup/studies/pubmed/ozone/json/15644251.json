The formation of bromoorganic DBPs during ozonation generally increased with the increase of temperature, but might also decrease for the waters with somewhat higher values of specific UV absorbance (SUVA). The addition of hydrogen peroxide, ethanol, or ammonium dramatically decreased the formation of bromoorganic DBPs; t-butanol addition significantly increased the formation of bromoorganic DBPs; bicarbonate addition might increase or decrease bromoorganic DBP formation depending on the water source. For all the waters treated with the chemical addition, the level of total organic bromine (TOBr) varied with the same pace as that of ozone exposure (CT), which suggests that TOBr formed during ozonation may be used to estimate the CT, a measure for the achieved degree of disinfection. The results demonstrate that for each water, the correlation between TOBr and CT was less affected by the change of chemical composition of the water than that between BrO(3)(-) and CT; for a given chemical composition and temperature of a water, there generally were well-defined relationships between TOBr and CT, and bromoform and CT just as that between BrO(3)(-) and CT. The possible mechanisms behind the linear functions of TOBr or BrO(3)(-) versus CT were given. Further study is needed to examine whether the trends found in this research can be applicable for the high SUVA waters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. xzhang1@nd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiangru", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Echigo", "ForeName": "Shinya", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Hongxia", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Michael E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Minear", "ForeName": "Roger A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Talley", "ForeName": "Jeffrey W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicarbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MD83SFE959", "NameOfSubstance": "tert-Butyl Alcohol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bicarbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "tert-Butyl Alcohol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15644251", "10.1016/j.watres.2004.10.007", "S0043-1354(04)00508-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
