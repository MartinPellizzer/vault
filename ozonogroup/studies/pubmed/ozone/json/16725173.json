The absolute rate constant was evaluated and first by-products were identified. The reaction was studied in the 2.0-8.0 pH range and was found to be a second-order reaction, first-order relative to each compound concentration. The rate constant, determined by kinetic experiments in presence of an OH radical scavenger (tert-butanol), was independent of pH. The value was evaluated to be equal to 480+/-30 M(-1)s(-1) by two kinetic methods. Mass spectrometry analyses were performed to investigate primary degradation products generated by the reaction of ozone with progesterone. Two by-products were evidenced. According to these results, a degradation pathway of progesterone reacting with ozone was proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Chimie de l'Eau et de l'Environnement, Ecole Superieure d'Ingenieurs de Poitiers, 40 avenue du Recteur Pineau, 86 022 Poitiers, Cedex, France. emmanuelle.barron@etu.univ-poitiers.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barron", "ForeName": "Emmanuelle", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deborde", "ForeName": "Marie", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rabouan", "ForeName": "Sylvie", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mazellier", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Legube", "ForeName": "Bernard", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G7DS2Q64Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Progesterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Progesterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16725173", "10.1016/j.watres.2006.03.034", "S0043-1354(06)00176-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
