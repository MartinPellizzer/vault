Results indicated that UV/H(2)O(2) oxidation could efficiently achieve decolorization and further mineralization. Pseudo first-order decolorization rate constants, k, ranged between 2.9 and 5.4 h(-1) with higher values for lower H(2)O(2) dosage (i.e., 10 mg/l H(2)O(2)) when the decolorization occurred at the reaction pH of 11.9, whereas a faster decolorization was achieved with increase in H(2)O(2) dosage at both pH 6.5 and 2.5, resulting in the values of k as fast as 15.4 and 26.6 h(-1) with 300 mg/l H(2)O(2) at pH 6.5 and 2.5, respectively. Difference in decolorization rates was attributed to the reaction pH rather than to the initial color intensity, resulting from the scavenging of hydroxyl radical by carbonate ion. About 40% of spontaneous mineralization was achieved with addition of 10 mg/l H(2)O(2) at pH 6.5. Efficient decolorization and extension of H(2)O(2) longevity were observed at pH 6.5 conditions. It is recommended that the colored effluents from alkaline TNT hydrolysis be neutralized prior to a decolorization step."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA. hwang.sangchul@epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Sangchul", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bouwer", "ForeName": "Edward J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larson", "ForeName": "Steven L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Jeffrey L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "118-96-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Trinitrotoluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trinitrotoluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15081163", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2003.11.016", "S0304389404000184"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
