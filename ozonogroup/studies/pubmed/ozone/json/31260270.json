Both primary and secondary reaction products, i.e., 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA), have been reported in indoor occupied spaces. However, the abundance of these products indoors is a function of many variables, including the amount of ozone and occupants present as well as indoor removal processes. In this study, we develop a time-dependent kinetic model describing the behavior of ozone/squalene reaction products indoors, including the reaction process and physical adsorption process of products on indoor surfaces. The key parameters in the model were obtained by fitting time-resolved concentrations of 6-MHO, 4-OPA, and ozone in a university classroom on 1 day with multiple class sessions. The model predictions were subsequently tested against observations from four additional measurement days in the same classroom. Model predictions and experimental data agreed well (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.87-0.92) for all test days, including \u223c7 class sessions covering a range of occupants (10-70) and ozone concentrations (0.09-32 ppb), demonstrating the effectiveness of the model. Accounting for surface uptake of 6-MHO and 4-OPA significantly improved model predictions (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.52-0.76 without surface uptake), reflecting the importance of including surface interactions to quantitatively represent product behavior in indoor environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering , Beijing Institute of Technology , Beijing 100081 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8057-4263"], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Jianyin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering , Beijing Institute of Technology , Beijing 100081 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhangcan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indoor Environment Group, Energy Technologies Area , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xiaochen", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology & Hydrology , Edinburgh , Midlothian EH26 0QB , United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Misztal", "ForeName": "Pawel K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7QWM220FJH", "NameOfSubstance": "Squalene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Squalene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Universities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31260270", "10.1021/acs.est.9b02302"]}}]}
