To combat this problem, it is imperative that new antibiotics and treatment modalities be developed, especially those toward which bacteria are less capable of developing resistance. Peptide natural products stand as promising candidates to meet this need as bacterial resistance is typically slow in response to their unique modes of action. They also have additional benefits including favorable modulation of host immune responses and often possess broad-spectrum activity against notoriously treatment resistant bacterial biofilms. Moreover, nature has provided a wealth of peptide-based natural products from a range of sources, including bacteria and fungi, which can be hijacked in order to combat more dangerous clinically relevant infections.This Account highlights recent advances in the total synthesis and development of a range of peptide-based natural product antibiotics and details the medicinal chemistry approaches used to optimize their activity.In the context of antibiotics with potential to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections, this Account covers the synthesis and optimization of the natural products daptomycin, glycocin F, and alamethicin. In particular, the reported synthesis of daptomycin highlights the utility of on-resin ozonolysis for accessing a key kynurenine residue from the canonical amino acid tryptophan. Furthermore, the investigation into glycocin F analogues uncovered a potent lead compound against <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> that bears a non-native thioacetal linkage to a <i>N-</i>acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar, which is otherwise <i>O</i>-linked in its native form.For mycobacterial infections, this Account covers the synthesis and optimization of teixobactin, callyaerin A, lassomycin, and trichoderin A. The synthesis of callyaerin A, in particular, highlighted the importance of a (<i>Z</i>)-2,3-diaminoacrylamide motif for antimicrobial activity against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, while the synthesis of trichoderin A highlighted the importance of (<i>R</i>)-stereoconfiguration in a key 2-amino-6-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-oxodecanoic acid (AHMOD) residue.Lastly, this Account covers lipopeptide antibiotics bearing activity toward Gram-negative bacterial infections, namely, battacin and paenipeptin C. In both cases, optimization of the N-terminal lipid tails led to the identification of analogues with potent activity toward <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences The University of Auckland, 23 Symonds St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Hanna", "ForeName": "Cameron C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences The University of Auckland, 23 Symonds St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, The University of Auckland, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Hermant", "ForeName": "Yann O", "Initials": "YO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2579-4543"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences The University of Auckland, 23 Symonds St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, The University of Auckland, 3A Symonds St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, The University of Auckland, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Harris", "ForeName": "Paul W R", "Initials": "PWR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7086-4096"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences The University of Auckland, 23 Symonds St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, The University of Auckland, 3A Symonds St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, The University of Auckland, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Brimble", "ForeName": "Margaret A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acc Chem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0157313", "ISSNLinking": "0001-4842"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacteriocins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "glycocin F, Lactobacillus plantarum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27061-78-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Alamethicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NWQ5N31VKK", "NameOfSubstance": "Daptomycin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alamethicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriocins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Daptomycin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33750106", "10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00841"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
