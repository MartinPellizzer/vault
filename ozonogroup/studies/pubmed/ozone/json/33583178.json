The objectives were to evaluate the variability in susceptibilities to free chlorine, UV<sub>254</sub>, and ozone among 13 variants of coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) and develop the model allowing for predicting the overall inactivation of heterogeneous CVB5. Our results showed that the susceptibilities differed by up to 3.4-fold, 1.3-fold, and 1.8-fold in free chlorine, UV<sub>254</sub>, and ozone, respectively. CVB5 in genogroup B exhibited significantly lower susceptibility to free chlorine and ozone than genogroup A, where the laboratory strain, Faulkner, belongs. The capsid protein in genogroup B contained a lower number of sulfur-containing amino acids, readily reactive to oxidants. We reformulated the Chick-Watson model by incorporating the probability distributions of inactivation rate constants to capture the heterogeneity. This expanded Chick-Watson model indicated that up to 4.2-fold larger free chlorine CT is required to achieve 6-log inactivation of CVB5 than the prediction by the Faulkner strain. Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate the variation in disinfection susceptibilities for predicting the overall inactivation of a certain type of viruses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6655-7440"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan."}], "LastName": "Torii", "ForeName": "Shotaro", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8235-757X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Marine Environmental Studies (CMES), Ehime University, Bunkyo-cho 3, Matsuyama-shi, Ehime 790-8577, Japan."}], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "Fuminari", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Virology, Toyama Institute of Health, 17-1 Nakataikoyama, Imizu-shi, Toyama 939-0363, Japan."}], "LastName": "Itamochi", "ForeName": "Masae", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Viral Infection I, Department of Infection Control and Immunology, O\u0305mura Satoshi Memorial Institute & Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan."}], "LastName": "Haga", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Viral Infection I, Department of Infection Control and Immunology, O\u0305mura Satoshi Memorial Institute & Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan."}], "LastName": "Katayama", "ForeName": "Kazuhiko", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan."}], "LastName": "Katayama", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus B, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33583178", "10.1021/acs.est.0c07796"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
