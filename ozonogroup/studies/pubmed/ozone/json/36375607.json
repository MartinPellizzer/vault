In this study, we demonstrate that by taking atrazine (ATZ) as a model pollutant, the removal rates of catalytic ozonation were negatively correlated with the interlayer water content of metal-modified montmorillonite (M<sub>x</sub>@MMT), instead of the loadings metals. Among the modified MMT, Zn<sub>0.1</sub>@MMT achieved 83.2% degradation of ATZ within 15\u00a0min, and corresponding removal rates of COD and total organic carbon (TOC) reached 40.3% and 46.5%, respectively. Detailed EPR and quenching experiments identified that hydroxyl radicals (HO\u2022) were the main reactive oxygen species and QTOF/MS/MS analysis helped to propose a possible degradation pathway of ATZ. Moreover, the catalytic performance of Zn<sub>0.1</sub>@MMT under different conditions was also systematically evaluated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
