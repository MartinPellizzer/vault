We demonstrate the power of this method with the study of the ozonolysis of isoprene, CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]C(CH3)-CH[double bond, length as m-dash]CH2, the most abundant, non-methane hydrocarbon emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation. Isoprene is an asymmetric diene, and reacts with O3 at the 1,2 position to produce methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), formaldehyde, and a pair of carbonyl oxides: [CH3CO-CH[double bond, length as m-dash]CH2 + CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]OO] + [CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]O + CH3COO-CH[double bond, length as m-dash]CH2]. Alternatively, O3 could attack at the 3,4 position to produce methacrolein (MACR), formaldehyde, and two carbonyl oxides [CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]C(CH3)-CHO + CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]OO] + [CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]O + CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]C(CH3)-CHOO]. Purified O3 and isoprene were mixed for approximately 10 seconds under dilute (1.5-4% in argon) continuous flow conditions in an alumina tube held at 298 K and 5 Torr. Products exiting the tube were rapidly slowed and cooled within the buffer gas cell by collisions with cryogenic (4-7 K) He. High resolution chirped pulse microwave detection between 12 and 26 GHz was used to achieve highly sensitive (ppb scale), isomer-specific product quantification. We observed a ratio of MACR to MVK of 2.1 \u00b1 0.4 under 1\u2009:\u20091 ozone to isoprene conditions and 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 under 2\u2009:\u20091 ozone to isoprene conditions, a finding which is consistent with previous experimental results. Additionally, we discuss relative quantities of formic acid (HCOOH), an isomer of CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]OO, and formaldehyde (CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]O) under varying experimental conditions, and characterize the spectroscopic parameters of the singly-substituted 13C trans-isoprene and 13C anti-periplanar-methacrolein species. This work has the potential to be extended towards a complete branching ratio analysis, as well towards the ability to isolate, identify, and quantify new reactive intermediates in the ozonolysis of alkenes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA. jessica.porterfield@cfa.harvard.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Porterfield", "ForeName": "Jessica P", "Initials": "JP", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eibenberger", "ForeName": "Sandra", "Initials": "S", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patterson", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCarthy", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29892741", "10.1039/c8cp02055h"]}}]}
