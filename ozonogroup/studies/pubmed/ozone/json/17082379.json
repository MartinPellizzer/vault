One- to five-minute averages of breathing frequency (f(B)) and minute ventilation (Ve) were used to generate plots of cumulative breaths and cumulative exposure volume vs. time and cumulative exposure volume vs. cumulative breaths. Analysis revealed a three-phase response; delay, no response detected; onset, f(B) began to increase; response, f(B) stabilized. Regression analysis was used to identify four parameters: time to onset, number of breaths at onset, cumulative inhaled dose of ozone at onset of O3-induced tachypnea, and the percent change in f(B). The effect of altering O3 concentration, Ve, atropine treatment, and indomethacin treatment were examined. We found that the lower the O3 concentration, the greater the number of breaths at onset of tachypnea at a fixed ventilation, whereas number of breaths at onset of tachypnea remains unchanged when Ve is altered and O3 concentration is fixed. The cumulative inhaled dose of O3 at onset of tachypnea remained constant and showed no relationship with the magnitude of percent change in f(B). Atropine did not affect any of the derived parameters, whereas indomethacin did not affect time to onset, number of breaths at onset, or cumulative inhaled dose of O3 at onset of tachypnea but did attenuate percent change in f(B). The results are discussed in the context of dose response and intrinsic mechanisms of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Anatomy, Physiology, and Cell Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Univ. of California, One Shields Ave., Davis, CA 95616, USA. esschelegle@ucdavis.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schelegle", "ForeName": "Edward S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walby", "ForeName": "William F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "William C", "Initials": "WC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Muscarinic Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscarinic Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17082379", "10.1152/japplphysiol.00141.2006", "00141.2006"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
