Previous studies show that marine-emitted halogens significantly influence O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, mainly through the consumption of O<sub>3</sub> by bromine and iodine atoms. In this study, we investigate the temporal variation at finer time scales (daily and hourly) than previous studies (annual or monthly) to better characterize the influence of marine-emitted halogens on coastal O<sub>3</sub>. In contrast to previous studies that mainly reported a decrease in O<sub>3</sub>, our results show significant temporal variations in halogen-induced O<sub>3</sub> changes. More specifically, the halogen-induced decrease in coastal O<sub>3</sub> in southern China is concentrated on clean days, while an unexpected increase in some regions of up to >10 ppbv could occur on polluted days. On polluted days, the activation of particulate chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) in sea salt aerosol (SSA) is effective due to the high level of dinitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) that is formed from the reactions of O<sub>3</sub> and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). In addition, the wind fields are unfavorable for the transport of marine air masses with large O<sub>3</sub> depletion inland. These two factors together result in the increase in hourly and MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> on polluted days in some regions in the GBA. The locations of O<sub>3</sub> increases are controlled by the distribution of nitryl chloride (ClNO<sub>2</sub>) at sunrise, which is influenced by O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> during the previous night. As a result, the increase in O<sub>3</sub> is a continuation of the O<sub>3</sub> pollution from the previous day, and the whole area is under potential threat of this worsening pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
