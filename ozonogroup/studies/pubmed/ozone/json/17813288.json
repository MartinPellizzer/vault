A modeling study of methanol fuel use in Los Angeles, California, shows that the low chemical reactivity of methanol vapor slows ozone formation and would lead to lower ozone concentrations. Predicted peak ozone levels decreased up to 16 percent, and exposure to levels above the federal standard dropped by up to 22 percent, when pure (M100) methanol fuel use was simulated for the year 2000. Similar results were obtained for 2010. Use of a gasoline-methanol blend (M85) resulted in smaller reductions. Predicted formaldehyde levels and exposure were not increased severely, and in some cases declined, in the simulations of methanol use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "St Pierre", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milford", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17813288", "10.1126/science.247.4939.201", "247/4939/201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
