Microspores, the pollen (male gametophyte) of Hippeastrum hybridum, Philadelphus grandiflorus, and Betula verrucosa and vegetative microspores of the spore-breeding plant Equisetum arvense served as models. It was found that the addition of the chemiluminescent probe lucigenin, which luminesces in the presence of superoxide anionradicals, leads to intensive chemiluminescence of microspores. No emission was observed in the absence of lucigenin and in the presence of the dye luminol as a chemiluminescent probe. The emission decreased significantly if superoxide dismutase, an enzyme of the superoxide anionradical dismutation during which this radical disappeared, was added before the dye addition. The autofluorescence intensity of microspores decreased in the presence of both superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, an enzyme destroying hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides. The most significant effect was noted after the addition of peroxidase, which indicates a greater contribution of peroxides to this type of emission. The fumigation with ozone, which increases the amount of ROS on the cell surface, enhanced the intensity of the chemiluminescence of microspores with lucigenin, but decreased the intensity of the autofluorescence of microspores. Exogenous peroxides (hydrogen peroxide and tert-butylhydroperoxide) stimulated the autofluorescence of pollen and vegetative spores in a concentration-dependent manner. It was shown that the formation of ROS contributes to the luminescence of plant microspores, which reflects their functional state."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Cell Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, Moscow Region, 142290 Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roshchina", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Safronova", "ForeName": "V G", "Initials": "VG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karnaukhov", "ForeName": "V N", "Initials": "VN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Aktivnye formy kisloroda i liuminestsentsiia intaktnykh kletok mikrospor."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Biofizika", "NlmUniqueID": "0372666", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3029"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Equisetum"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrangeaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spores"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12723352"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
