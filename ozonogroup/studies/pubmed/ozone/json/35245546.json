However, their synergistic effects remain unclear and have not yet been well assessed. By applying the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Chemistry-Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (WRF/Chem-MEGAN) model, this study reveals that in the presence of sufficient BVOC emissions, which act as a fuel, SNO emissions act as a fuel additive and promote the chemical reactions of BVOCs and the subsequent production of O<sub>3</sub>. Consequently, the synergistic effects of BVOC and SNO emissions on summertime O<sub>3</sub> production surpassed the sum of their individual effects by as much as 10-20 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> in eastern China in 2014. In order to reduce O<sub>3</sub> concentration to a level corresponding to no natural emissions of BVOC or SNO (i.e., the BASE scenario), the anthropogenic volatile organic compound (AVOC) emissions in the scenario considers BVOC and SNO emissions must be reduced by 1.76 times that of the BASE scenario. This study demonstrates that the synergistic effects of BVOC and SNO emissions can impede ground-level O<sub>3</sub> regulation and can subsequently impose stricter requirements on anthropogenic precursor emission control in China. The results of this study can also inform efforts in other regions that are still combating ground-level O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
