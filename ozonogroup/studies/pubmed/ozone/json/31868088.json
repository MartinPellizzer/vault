The influence of operating conditions such as initial ammonia concentration and flow rate of gas on the reduction of ammonia concentration was investigated in homemade photochemical unit. The conversion of ammonia decreased with increasing initial concentration of ammonia and with increasing flow rate of air (decreasing retention time). The highest conversion of ammonia (97%) was achieved under lower initial concentration of ammonia (30\u2009ppm) and lower flow rate of air (28\u2009m<sup>3</sup>/h). The energy per order was evaluated for the advanced oxidation process too. The energy consumption was about 0.037\u2009kWh/m<sup>3</sup>/order for the 97% ammonia conversion at 30\u2009ppm of initial ammonia concentration and 28\u2009m<sup>3</sup>/h flow rate of air. Based on the results, the advanced oxidation process combining the UV irradiation and ozone was effective for mitigation of ammonia concentration and presents a promising technology for the reduction of odor emissions from livestock buildings. Moreover, the AOPs are suitable for application for high flow rate of air, especially for ammonia abatement from livestock buildings, where very high efficiency is expected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Technology, V\u0160B-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6682-7404"], "LastName": "Ko\u010d\u00ed", "ForeName": "Kamila", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Technology, V\u0160B-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4003-0234"], "LastName": "Reli", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Technology, V\u0160B-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Troppov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Ivana", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Technology, V\u0160B-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Materials Science and Technology, V\u0160B-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5796-3022"], "LastName": "Prost\u011bjovsk\u00fd", "ForeName": "Tom\u00e1\u0161", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dekonta Inc., Stehel\u010deves, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "\u017debr\u00e1k", "ForeName": "Radim", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31868088", "10.1080/10934529.2019.1705105"]}}]}
