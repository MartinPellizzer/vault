At the reaction temperature of 295 K, the Ag/Al(2)O(3) catalysts showed selectivity to CO(x) (ca. 80%) higher than that of the oxide of metals in the first transition series (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) supported on Al(2)O(3), which had selectivities of 28-62%. The catalyst showed gradual deactivation from accumulation of byproduct compounds on the catalyst surface. FTIR studies revealed that the byproduct compounds consisted of easily decomposable species and hardly decomposable species. The rate for benzene oxidation linearly increased with Ag loadings (approximately 15 wt %) and was not improved at higher loading levels. The ratios of ozone decomposition to benzene oxidation and ozone decomposition to CO(x) selectivity were evaluated to be 7.5 and 80%, respectively, and they were independent of benzene conversion. The Ag/Al(2)O(3) catalyst showed steady-state activities at a reaction temperature of 313-373 K, and the conversion increased with the increase in the reaction temperature. The presence of water vapor in the reaction gas inhibited the catalyst deactivation, and steady-state activity was obtained at a reaction temperature of 295 K, while it did not affect the activities for benzene oxidation but improved the CO(2) selectivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Engineering Sciences, Kyushu University, Kasuga, Fukuoka, Japan. einaga@mm.kyushu-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Einaga", "ForeName": "Hisahiro", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogata", "ForeName": "Atsushi", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steam"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Steam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20222728", "10.1021/es903095j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
