However, there are many controversies and contradictions regarding the mechanisms of catalytic ozonation in literature, which has seriously confounded the development of the technology towards industrial applications. Herein, a critical review of literature is conducted to reveal possible underlying causes of the controversies and contradictions, and several common pitfalls in the experimental design and data interpretation are identified, e.g., the fundamentally flawed quenching method popularly used for evaluating the role of reactive oxygen species for pollutant abatement in catalytic ozonation and the neglect of monitoring ozone transfer doses in lab-scale experiments. Based on the identified pitfalls, several measures are suggested to improve the experimental design and data interpretation of catalytic ozonation studies. In addition, recent advances in mechanistic understanding of catalytic ozonation by principle-based modelling approaches are described. Finally, additional works that are needed to shrink the gap between academic research and practical applications and the prospect of catalytic ozonation in future water and wastewater treatment systems are analyzed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
