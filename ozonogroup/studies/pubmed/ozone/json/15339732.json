Seven-year-old trees of Clones 4 and 80 growing outside in open-top chambers were exposed for 3 years to the following treatments: outside control (OC); chamber control (CC); 2 x ambient [CO2] (EC); 2 x ambient [O3] (EO); and 2 x ambient [CO2] + 2 x ambient [O3] (EC+EO). When the results for the two clones were analyzed together, elevated [CO2] increased tree growth and biomass, but had no effect on biomass allocation. Total leaf area increased and leaf abscission was delayed in response to elevated [CO2]. Elevated [O3] decreased dry mass of roots and branches and mean leaf size and induced earlier leaf abscission in the autumn; otherwise, the effects of elevated [O3] were small across the clones. However, there were significant interactions between elevated [CO2] and elevated [O3]. When results for the clones were analyzed separately, stem diameter, volume growth and total biomass of Clone 80 were increased by elevated [CO2] and the stimulatory effects of elevated [CO2] on stem volume growth and total leaf area increased during the 3-year study. Clone 80 was unaffected by elevated [O3]. In Clone 4, elevated [O3] decreased root and branch biomass by 38 and 29%, respectively, whereas this clone showed few responses to elevated [CO2]. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased total leaf area in Clone 80 only, which may partly explain the smaller growth responses to elevated [CO2] of Clone 4 compared with Clone 80. Although we observed responses to elevated [O3], the responses to the EC+EO and EC treatments were similar, indicating that the trees only responded to elevated [O3] under ambient [CO2] conditions, perhaps reflecting a greater quantity of carbohydrates available for detoxification and repair in elevated [CO2]."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riikonen", "ForeName": "Johanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lindsberg", "ForeName": "Minna-Mari", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holopainen", "ForeName": "Toini", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oksanen", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lappi", "ForeName": "Juha", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peltonen", "ForeName": "Petri", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vapaavuori", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15339732", "10.1093/treephys/24.11.1227"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
