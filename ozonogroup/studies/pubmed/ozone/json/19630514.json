Commercial treatments by irradiation or ozone gas of Salmonella spp. artificially inoculated seeds were compared, and these resulted in a 1 log reduction after all treatments. Use of peroxyacetic acid (1%) sanitizer on Salmonella spp. or Escherichia coli O157:H7 inoculated alfalfa seeds consistently resulted in a greater than 1 log reduction. In addition, during these studies debris was noted after the seeds were removed. Based on this observation, an air-mixing wash basin was developed for commercial use. Validation was done by commercial growers using 1% peroxyacetic acid sanitizer to wash seeds in the air-mixing basin, followed by sprouting the seeds. No positive or false-positive pathogen results were reported after the required testing of the sprout water (run-off during sprouting). Use of 1% peroxyacetic acid sanitizer in the air-mixing wash basin does provide the sprout grower an effective means of sanitizing sprout seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety Intervention Technologies Research Unit, Eastern Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, USA. kathleen.rajkowski@ars.usda.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajkowski", "ForeName": "Kathleen T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashurst", "ForeName": "Kean", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Foodborne Pathog Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101120121", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3141"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I6KPI2E1HD", "NameOfSubstance": "Peracetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Medicago sativa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peracetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}], "NumberOfReferences": "15"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19630514", "10.1089/fpd.2009.0267"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
