Fe2O3/Al2O3@SBA-15 was found to be highly effective for the mineralization of ibuprofen aqueous solution with ozone. The characterization studies showed that Al-O-Si was formed by the substitution of Al(3+) for the hydrogen of surface Si-OH groups, not only resulting in high dispersion of Al2O3 and Fe2O3 on SBA-15, but also inducing the greatest amount of surface Lewis acid sites. By studies of in situ attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR), in situ Raman, and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, the chemisorbed ozone was decomposed into surface atomic oxygen species at the Lewis acid sites of Al(3+) while it was converted into surface adsorbed (\u2022)OHads and O2(\u2022-) radicals at the Lewis acid sites of Fe(3+). The combination of both Lewis acid sites of iron and aluminum onto Fe2O3/Al2O3@SBA-15 enhanced the formation of (\u2022)OHads and O2(\u2022-) radicals, leading to highest reactivity. Mechanisms of catalytic ozonation were proposed for the tested catalysts on the basis of all the experimental information."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Bing", "ForeName": "Jishuai", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Yulun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Jiuhui", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "SBA-15"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Suspensions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WK2XYI10QM", "NameOfSubstance": "Ibuprofen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ibuprofen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photoelectron Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suspensions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25564945", "10.1021/es503729h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
