This paper outlined the development history of research on O<sub>3</sub> formation sensitivity based on observational methods, described the principle and applicability of the methodology, summarized the relative application results in China and provided recommendations on the prevention and control of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China based on relevant study results, and finally pointed out the shortcomings and future development prospects in this field in China. The overview study showed that the O<sub>3</sub> formation sensitivity in some urban areas in China in recent years presented a gradual shifting tendency from the VOC-limited regime to the transition regime or the NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime due to the implementation of the O<sub>3</sub> precursors emission reduction policies; O<sub>3</sub> pollution control strategies and precursor control countermeasures should be formulated based on local conditions and the dynamic control capability of O<sub>3</sub> pollution control measures should be improved. There are still some current deficiencies in the study field in China. Therefore, it is recommended that a stereoscopic monitoring network for atmospheric photochemical components should be further constructed and improved; the atmospheric chemical mechanisms should be vigorously developed, and standardized methods for determining the O<sub>3</sub> formation sensitivity should be established in China in the near future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
