The therapeutic approach is often only symptomatic and not etiologic.", "Since 2013, 186 patients (97 males and 89 females, mean age 59.8 years) have undergone microsurgery for lumbar disc hernia or lumbar segmental stenosis. Among these patients, 23 had been previously treated with ozone therapy by the intraforaminal approach and 28 by intraforaminal steroid injections in other hospitals between 12 and 24 months before our clinical evaluation. These patients received 16 applications in an 8-week period (standard therapy).", "During the surgery, many hard adhesions between the soft tissues and bony structures were unexpectedly discovered. In particular, it was noted that the root contracted and had firm adhesions to the dural sac and/or fragmented disc, which were difficult to resolve. These specific pathological patterns were observed only in the patients who received ozone injections by the intraforaminal approach. We did not find any pathological abnormalities in the patients who did not receive any injections or who received intraforaminal steroid injections. Thus, we could exclude that the tissue damage was due to the mechanical action of the needle.", "It is important to assert that ozone therapy procedures can be associated with several major complications. Therefore, performing a revision of the guidelines and protocols for ozone therapy application is indispensable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthopaedic and Traumatology Department, Chieti and Vertebral Surgery Department, \"G. d'Annunzio\" University, Vestini Street, ASL 2 Lanciano Vasto, Chieti, Italy. danielevannimd@libero.it."}], "LastName": "Vanni", "ForeName": "Daniele", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Operative Unit of Neurosurgery, San Salvatore Hospital, L'Aquila University, L'Aquila, Italy."}], "LastName": "Galzio", "ForeName": "Renato", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vertebral Surgery Department, ASL 2 Lanciano Vasto, Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Kazakova", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthopaedic and Traumatology Department, Chieti and Vertebral Surgery Department, \"G. d'Annunzio\" University, Vestini Street, ASL 2 Lanciano Vasto, Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Pantalone", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Floraspe Renzetti Hospital, Lanciano, Italy."}], "LastName": "Sparvieri", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthopaedic and Traumatology Department, Chieti and Vertebral Surgery Department, \"G. d'Annunzio\" University, Vestini Street, ASL 2 Lanciano Vasto, Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Salini", "ForeName": "Vincenzo", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vertebral Surgery Department, ASL 2 Lanciano Vasto, Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Magliani", "ForeName": "Vincenzo", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Acta Neurochir (Wien)", "NlmUniqueID": "0151000", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6268"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Acta Neurochir (Wien). 2016 May;158(5):989-90. doi: 10.1007/s00701-016-2754-z", "PMID": "26928731"}, {"RefSource": "Acta Neurochir (Wien). 2016 May;158(5):991-3. doi: 10.1007/s00701-016-2755-y", "PMID": "26976001"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pathology", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Dura Mater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Spinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Lumbosacral Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsurgery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Spinal Stenosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26293228", "10.1007/s00701-015-2545-y", "10.1007/s00701-015-2545-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
