We propose that this is hypoazidite (N<sub>3</sub>O<sup>-</sup> ), analogous to hypobromite, and that it plays a central role in the azide catalyzed decompostion of ozone. The yellow intermediate is unstable in acid, in which it rapidly decomposes, generating N<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. The rate of reaction was studied at pH 2.0-3.5, with the ionic strength at 0.6 M and temperature at 3-15 \u00b0 C. The intrinsic second-order rate constants were found to be k <sub>HN3</sub> \u2264 \u2248 400 M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup> and k <sub>N3</sub>- = (8.7 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup> (3 \u00b0C, 0.6 M), both in agreement with the only other previous study. The rate constant at 25 \u00b0C was estimated using the following experimentally determined parameters: ln k<sub>N3</sub>- (M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>) = (5.73 \u00b1 0.36) \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup>/T (K) + (28.34 \u00b1 1.27). The value of k<sub>N3</sub>- estimated in this way is (2.5 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup> at 25 \u00b0C and 0.6 M. The enthalpy of reaction (A H) is -48 \u00b1 3 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Atmospheric Sciences , University of Arizona , Tucson , Arizona , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Betterton", "ForeName": "Eric A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Atmospheric Sciences , University of Arizona , Tucson , Arizona , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Craig", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28072375", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463958"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
