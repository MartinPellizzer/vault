As part of the process to develop environmental and health effects criteria for halon substitutes, a cardiac sensitization test was conducted in beagle dogs. Cardiac sensitization to adrenaline is a phenomenon associated with the inhalation of a number of unsubstituted and halogenated hydrocarbons. Adrenaline was administered by intravenous injection before and during inhalation of the test substance. CF3I was administered to dogs at concentrations in air of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 or 1% v/v. At each of 0.4 and 1.0% CF3I, the first dog exposed developed fatal ventricular fibrillation, and no further dogs were exposed at these concentrations. There was no cardiac sensitization at 0.1 or 0.2% CF3I. For the C3F7I experiment, dogs were exposed to concentrations in air of 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4% v/v. At each of 0.1 and 0.4% C3F7I, one dog responded with multifocal ventricular ectopic beats. Thus, CF3I and C3F7I are potent cardiac sensitizers in the adrenaline-challenged dog model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dodd", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vinegar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromochlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flame Retardants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42A379KB0U", "NameOfSubstance": "trifluoroiodomethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "754-34-7", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1,2,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-1-iodopropane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91I5X8AJXS", "NameOfSubstance": "bromochlorodifluoromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YKH834O4BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Epinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromochlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Epinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Flame Retardants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Tachycardia, Ectopic Atrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Fibrillation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9598296", "10.3109/01480549809011643"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
