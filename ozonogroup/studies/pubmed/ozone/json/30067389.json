Exposures to ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm were assessed by weighted averages of daily levels from all monitors within 50 km of the geocoded location of a patient's residence. Patients were followed for 6 days for the development of ARDS according to Berlin Criteria. The association between each exposure and ARDS was determined via multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders.", "ARDS developed in 243 (24%) patients. None of the short-term exposures averaged over the 3 days before presentation was associated with ARDS, except sulfur dioxide, which demonstrated a nonlinear association. Nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter exposure over the 6 weeks before presentation was significantly associated with ARDS (P\u2009<\u20090.05).
