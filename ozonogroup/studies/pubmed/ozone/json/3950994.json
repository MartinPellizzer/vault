When the cells were exposed for 1 h at concentrations up to 6 ppm, the rate of DNA replication, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, declined further during a 3-h period immediately following exposure. At higher ozone concentrations, at which more than 99.9% of the cells were killed, no further decline in DNA replication was seen beyond that immediately following exposure. Cultures exposed for 1 h to 10 mM ethyl methanesulfonate or to 10 J/m2 of ultraviolet (UV) light showed a similar progressive decline in the rate of DNA replication. The inhibition of DNA replication by ozone resembled that seen after exposure of cells to chemical mutagens or radiation and did not resemble the inhibition produced by metabolic poisons. The results may indicate that ozone or its reaction products interact directly with DNA in a way that inhibits replication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rasmussen", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-01835", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9H154DI0UP", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethyl Methanesulfonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X6Q56QN5QC", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyurea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Replication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ethyl Methanesulfonate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyurea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3950994", "10.1080/15287398609530807"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
