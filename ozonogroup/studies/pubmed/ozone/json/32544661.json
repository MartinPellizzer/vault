We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the associations between short-term exposure to air pollutants and FeNO level. We searched PubMed and Web of Science and included a total of 27 articles which focused on associations between ambient air pollutants (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)) exposure and the change of FeNO. Random effect model was used to calculate the percent change of FeNO in association with a 10 or 1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in air pollutants exposure concentrations. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in short-term PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> exposure was associated with a 3.20% (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.11%, 5.29%), 2.25% (95%CI: 1.51%, 2.99%),4.90% (95%CI: 1.98%, 7.81%), and 8.28% (95%CI: 3.61%, 12.59%) change in FeNO, respectively. A 1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in short-term exposure to BC was associated with 3.42% (95%CI: 1.34%, 5.50%) change in FeNO. The association between short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and FeNO level was insignificant (P\uff1e0.05). Future studies are warranted to investigate the effect of multiple pollutants, different sources and composition of air pollutants on airway inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
