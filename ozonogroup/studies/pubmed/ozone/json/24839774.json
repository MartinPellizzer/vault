Moreover, NO increases gamma-globin and fetal hemoglobin levels in human erythroid progenitors.", "In order to find out whether simple physiologic stimulation of NO production by components of hematopoietic microenvironment can increase gamma-globin gene expression, the effects of NO-inducer bradykinin were examined in endothelial cells.", "The study was performed in co-cultures of human erythroid progenitors, TrHBMEC and HUVECs by ozone-based chemiluminescent determination of NO and real-time quantitative RT-PCR.", "In accordance with previous reports, the endogenous factor bradykinin increased endothelial cell production of NO in a dose- and time-dependent manner (0.1-0.6 microM up to 30 minutes).This induction of NO in HUVECs and TrHBMEC by bradykinin was blocked by competitive inhibitors of NO synthase (NOS), demonstrating NOS-dependence. It has been shown that bradykinin significantly reduced endothelial NOS (eNOS) mRNA level and eNOS/beta-actin ratio in HUVEC (by twofold). In addition, bradykinin failed to increase gamma-globin mRNA expression in erythroid progenitors only, as well as in co-culture studies of erythroid progenitors with TrHBMEC and HUVEC after 24 hours of treatment. Furthermore, bradykinin did not induce gamma/beta globin ratio in erythroid progenitors in co-cultures with HUVEC.", "Bradykinin mediated eNOS activation leads to short time and low NO production in endothelial cells, insufficient to induce gamma-globin gene expression. These results emphasized the significance of elevated and extended NO production in augmentation of gamma-globin gene expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Coki\u0107", "ForeName": "Vladan P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suboticki", "ForeName": "Tijana", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beleslin-Coki\u0107", "ForeName": "Bojana", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dikli\u0107", "ForeName": "Miloj", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Milenkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Pavle", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jovci\u0107", "ForeName": "Gordana", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Serbia", "MedlineTA": "Srp Arh Celok Lek", "NlmUniqueID": "0027440", "ISSNLinking": "0370-8179"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Globins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "NOS3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S8TIM42R2W", "NameOfSubstance": "Bradykinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bradykinin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Globins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24839774", "10.2298/sarh1404189c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
