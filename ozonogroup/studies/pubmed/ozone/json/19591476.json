By using broadband vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG), we track heterogeneous ozone reactions in real time. Ozone levels span three orders of magnitude and represent environments ranging from pristine remote continental regions to highly polluted urban centers, ranging from 30 ppb to 3 ppm (from 7 x 10(11) molecules cm(-3) to 7 x 10(13) molecules cm(-3)). We determine reaction rates and reactive uptake coefficients (gamma values). At these tropospherically relevant ozone levels, the heterogeneous reaction rates follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type mechanism. The product formation rates, which we determine as a function of ozone concentrations, are found to be half of the olefin reaction rates. This ratio is consistent with the previously proposed reaction pathway involving the breaking of one C=C double bond containing two olefinic CH moieties to form a product containing only one methyl group and one polar carbonyl moiety. Contact angle histograms show that out of a total of 60 measurements, there are about 25 more measurements with contact angles up to ten degrees below the mean recorded prior to reaction when ozone levels resemble remote continental conditions (50 ppb) than when ozone levels resemble urban conditions (1 ppm). The implication of these results are that the methyl formation pathway in heterogeneous ozonolysis may be less favorable than the carboxylic acid- and secondary ozonide-production pathway for ozone-limited conditions (i.e., in the remote continental troposphere or during urban nighttime) as opposed to ozone-rich (i.e., polluted urban atmosphere) conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd.
