Ozonation contributed to \u223c20% decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration at a dosage of 0.7\u202fmg of O<sub>3</sub>/mg of DOC, but no further reduction in DOC level was observed with an increased dose of 1.0\u202fmg of O<sub>3</sub>/mg of DOC. When chlorine or preformed monochloramine was used as a disinfectant, UBAC process led to \u223c40% reduction in the sum of detected DBP formation potential (FP) due to the removal of precursors at a feasible empty bed contact time of 15\u202fmin. The integrated effect of ozonation and UBAC biofiltration decreased the sum of DBP FP by \u223c50% including halonitromethanes (THNMs), N-nitrosamines (NAs), and bromate, which increased in the effluent of ozonation. Chloramination produced less DBPs by weight as well as DBPs-associated additive toxic potencies than chlorination. The reduction in additive toxic potencies was generally lower than the removal efficiency of DBP FP after chlor(am)ination of treated waters by O<sub>3</sub>/UBAC, indicating that the removal of DBPs-associated additive toxic potencies should be focused to better understand on the residual risk to public health in controlling DBP precursors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
