The results showed that the net photosynthetic rate (<i>P</i><sub>n</sub>), apparent electron transport rate (ETR), excitation energy capture efficiency of PS\u2161 reaction center (<i>F</i>'<sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i>'<sub>m</sub>), coefficient of photochemical quenching (qP), the maximum of carboxylation efficiency (<i>V</i><sub>cmax</sub>) and the maximum rate of electron transport (<i>J</i><sub>max</sub>) were significantly decreased with the increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentration. However, intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (<i>c</i><sub>i</sub>) was significantly increased and stomatal conductance (<i>G</i><sub>s</sub>) remained unchanged. There was significant difference in biomass at the end of growing season. However, in a certain extent, nitrogen deposition improved photosynthetic capacity and biomass of <i>P. cathayana</i>. The interaction of O<sub>3</sub> and nitrogen deposition was not significant in terms of plant photosynthetic characteristics. The current results provided scientific basis for the protection of <i>P. cathayana</i> in response to the global O<sub>3</sub> concentration and nitrogen deposition increase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun Academy of Forestry, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xing-Ling", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964803", "10.13227/j.hjkx.2016.09.048"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
