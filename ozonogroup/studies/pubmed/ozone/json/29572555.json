In order to protect sensitive plants from O<sub>3</sub> pollution, many kinds of protectants including synthetic ones, were assessed in previous studies. Although they have certain protective effects, some of them are not environment-friendly. In the present study, leaf water extracts of aromatic plants [Plectranthus hadiensis var. tomentosus (PHT), Pelargonium hortorum (PHB), Tagetes patula (TP)] were compared for mitigating the damages caused by O<sub>3</sub> (150\u00a0ppb for 3 days, 8\u00a0h day<sup>-1</sup>) on snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris 'Jiangjunyoudou'). Our results showed that O<sub>3</sub> fumigation impaired plasma membrane, decreased chlorophyll content, increased contents of malondialdehyde and superoxide anion, inhibited photosynthesis, and caused visible injury. Leaf water extracts of PHT, PHB or TP ameliorated the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub>. Among them, extract of PHT showed the greatest potential to alleviate the O<sub>3</sub>-caused injury, followed by PHB and TP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Northeast Agricultural University, Changjiang Road 600, Harbin, 150030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Northeast Agricultural University, Changjiang Road 600, Harbin, 150030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "M X", "Initials": "MX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Northeast Agricultural University, Changjiang Road 600, Harbin, 150030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sui", "ForeName": "J X", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Northeast Agricultural University, Changjiang Road 600, Harbin, 150030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Y Q", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Northeast Agricultural University, Changjiang Road 600, Harbin, 150030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Northeast Agricultural University, Changjiang Road 600, Harbin, 150030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Northeast Agricultural University, Changjiang Road 600, Harbin, 150030, China. caszhanglu@hotmail.com."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5537-0445"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31401895", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "UNPYSCT-2017023", "Agency": "University Nursing Program for Young Scholar with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phaseolus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29572555", "10.1007/s00128-018-2331-7", "10.1007/s00128-018-2331-7"]}}]}
