This study presents a novel automated analytical system for monitoring changes in the electron donating capacity (EDC) and UV absorbance of DOM during ozonation. In a first step, a quantitative photometric EDC assay was developed based on electron-transfer reactions from phenolic moieties in DOM to an added chemical oxidant, the radical cation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS<sup>\u00b7</sup><sup>+</sup>). The assay is highly sensitive (limit of quantification \u223c0.5 mg<sub>DOC</sub>\u00b7L<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>) and EDC values of model DOM isolates determined by this assay were in good agreement with values determined previously by mediated electrochemical oxidation (slope\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.98). In a second step, the photometric EDC measurement method was transferred onto an automated fluidic system coupled to a photometer (EDC analyzer). The EDC analyzer was then used to monitor changes in EDC and UV absorbance of secondary wastewater effluent treated with ozone. While both parameters exhibited a dose-dependent decrease, a more pronounced decrease in EDC as compared to UV absorbance was observed at specific ozone doses up to 0.4 mg<sub>O</sub><sub>3</sub>\u00b7g<sub>DOC</sub><sup>-1</sup>. The concentration of 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol, a phenolic micropollutant with a high ozone reactivity, decreased proportionally to the EDC decrease. In contrast, abatement of less ozone-reactive micropollutants and bromate formation started only after a pronounced initial decrease in EDC. The on-line EDC analyzer presented herein will enable a comprehensive assessment of the combination of EDC and UV absorbance as control parameters for full-scale ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
