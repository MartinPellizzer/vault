Results showed that 30 compounds of 3 classes were detected from 67 kinds of VOCs in all the samples collected. The concentrations of carbonyl compounds, halogenated hydrocarbons and benzenes detected were in the ranges of 0.04-61.27, 0.02-35.61 and 0.07-2.33 microg x L(-1) respectively. Comparing the changes of different VOCs in three drinking water treatment plants, conventional chlorination process could effectively remove benzenes but meanwhile produced trihalomethanes (THMs). Additional advanced treatment ozonation-biological activated carbon process could decrease the formation of THMs during pre-chlorination but produced new risky contaminants like carbonyl compounds. The changes of VOCs in tap water were also investigated. It was found that carbonyl compounds produced by ozonation could be further transformed to THMs with residual chlorine. However, the health risks of all detected compounds in tap water were at a low level, except that the carcinogenic risk of crotonaldehydes (9.3 x 10(-5)-2.2 x 10(-4)) was slightly higher than the US EPA threshold (10(-6)-10(-4))."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xi-Chao", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Zi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zi-Jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Ke-Wen", "Initials": "KW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24640902"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
