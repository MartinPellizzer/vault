Nowadays, heterogeneous photocatalysis coupled oxidant activation techniques are intensively studied due to their dual advantages of high mineralization and high oxidation efficiency in pollutant degradation. This paved a new way for the development of solar-driven oxidation technologies. Previous reviews focused on the advances in one specific coupling technique, such as photocatalytic persulfate activation and photocatalytic ozonation, but lack a consolidated understanding of the synergy between photocatalytic oxidation and oxidant activation. The synergy involves the migration of photogenerated carriers, radical reaction, and the increase in oxidation rate and mineralization. This review systematically summarizes the fundamentals of activation mechanism, advanced characterization techniques and synergistic effects of coupling techniques for water decontamination. Besides, specific cases that lead researchers astray in revealing mechanisms and assessing synergy are critically discussed. Finally, the prospects and challenges are put forward to further deepen the research on heterogeneous photocatalytic activation of oxidants. This work provides a consolidated view of the existing heterogeneous photocatalysis coupled oxidant activation techniques and inspires researchers to develop more promising solar-driven technologies for water decontamination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
