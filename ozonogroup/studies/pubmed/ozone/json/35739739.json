Regulations on morphologies and Cu doping, as well as ozone promotion were conducted to optimize active oxygen of MnO<sub>2</sub> catalysts, contributing to excellent catalytic behaviors. Cu doping MnO<sub>2</sub> with hollow urchin-like morphology attained a stable 100% DCM conversion with O<sub>3</sub>/DCM molar ratio of 10 at 120\u00a0\u00b0C. The ozone utilization rate, final products, and byproducts distribution were discussed. Abundant crystal defects, low-valance Mn/Cu, O<sub>ads</sub>, and weak acidity, as well as better low temperature reducibility contributed to its superior performance. During DCM catalytic ozonation, DCM oxidation exhibited competitive effect on O<sub>3</sub> decomposition due to the occupation of intermediates (CH<sub>2</sub>ClO<sub>3</sub>\u00b7, O-CH<sub>2</sub>Cl, and O-CH<sub>2</sub> -O) over active sites that should belong to O<sub>3</sub> originally. Nevertheless, O<sub>3</sub> decomposition exhibited synergistic effects on DCM oxidation with promotion on active oxygen. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the positive effect on oxygen vacancy formation and O<sub>3</sub>/DCM adsorption from Cu doping. The possible mechanism for DCM catalytic ozonation included four parts, including O<sub>3</sub>/DCM adsorption, O<sub>3</sub> activation, DCM oxidation, and electron replenishment.
