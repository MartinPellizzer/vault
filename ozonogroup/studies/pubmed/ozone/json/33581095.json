However, little is known about date palm sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub>. Therefore, to identify their resistance mechanisms against elevated O<sub>3</sub>, physiological parameters (leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf pigments) and biomass growth responses to realistic O<sub>3</sub> exposure were tested in an isoprene-emitting date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Nabut Saif) by a Free-Air Controlled Exposure (FACE) facility with three levels of O<sub>3</sub> (ambient [AA, 45\u00a0ppb as 24-h average], 1.5 x AA and 2 x AA). We found a reduction of photosynthesis only at 2 x AA although some foliar traits known as early indicators of O<sub>3</sub> stress responded already at 1.5 x AA, such as increased dark respiration, reduced leaf pigment content, reduced maximum quantum yield of PSII, inactivation of the oxygen evolving complex of PSII and reduced performance index PI<sub>TOT</sub>. As a result, O<sub>3</sub> did not affect most of the growth parameters although significant declines of root biomass occurred only at 2 x AA. The major mechanism in date palm for reducing the severity of O<sub>3</sub> impacts was a restriction of stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake due to low stomatal conductance and O<sub>3</sub>-induced stomatal closure. In addition, an increased respiration in elevated O<sub>3</sub> may indicate an enhanced capacity of catabolizing metabolites for detoxification and repair. Interestingly, date palm produced low amounts of monoterpenes, whose emission was stimulated in 2 x AA, although isoprene emission declined at both 1.5 and 2 x AA. Our results warrant more research on a biological significance of terpenoids in plant resistance against O<sub>3</sub> stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
