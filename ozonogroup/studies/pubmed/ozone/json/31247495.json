The results revealed enhanced removal of tris (2-carboxylethyl) phosphine (TCEP), sucralose, and meprobamate during the O<sub>3</sub>/GAC treatment experiments compared to the sum of their removal during isolated ozonation and GAC adsorption experiments. The long-term O<sub>3</sub>/GAC experiment showed the promotive effect of GAC substantially decreased after 20\u202fh of O<sub>3</sub> exposure. This decreased performance correlates with changes to GAC surface properties caused by O<sub>3</sub>. After 6\u202fh of operation, O<sub>3</sub> initially led to an increase in Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area on the GAC improving the elimination level of investigated MPs (except N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR)). However, after 20\u202fh of exposure, O<sub>3</sub> ultimately caused structural damages to the GAC surface, decreased the BET surface area in the final stages of the experiment, and a 4-fold increase in O<sub>1s</sub>:C<sub>1s</sub> ratio on the GAC surface was observed due to an increase in surface acidic functional groups caused by O<sub>3</sub> treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
