Here we address the question whether the gaseous products or the ultrafine particles from the ozone-initiated chemistry of limonene, a common and abundant indoor pollutant, cause acute airway effects. The effects on the airways by d-limonene, a ca. 16s old ozone/d-limonene mixture, and clean air were evaluated by a mice bioassay, from which sensory irritation of the upper airways, airflow limitation, and pulmonary irritation can be obtained. A denuder was inserted to separate the ultrafine particles from the gaseous products prior to the exposure chamber. Reduction of mean respiratory frequency (>30%) and 230% increase of time of brake were observed without denuder, during 30min exposure, to the ozonolyzed d-limonene mixture, which are indicative of prominent sensory effects. The initial concentrations (ppm) were 40 d-limonene and 4 ozone. The exposure concentrations (ppm) were about 35 d-limonene and 0.05 ozone. Formaldehyde and residual d-limonene, the salient sensory irritants, accounted for up to three-fourth of the sensory irritation. The upper airway effects reversed to baseline upon cessation of exposure. An effect on the conducting airways was also significant, which did not reverse completely upon cessation. Airway effects were absent with the denuder inserted, which did not alter the size distribution of ultrafine particles ( approximately 10mg/m(3)), significantly. The result was statistically indistinguishable from clean dry air. It is concluded that ultrafine particles that are generated from ozone-initiated d-limonene chemistry and denuded are not causative of sensory effects in the airways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre for the Working Environment, DK-2100 Copenhagen \u00d8, Denmark. pwo@nrcwe.dk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolkoff", "ForeName": "Peder", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clausen", "ForeName": "Per A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larsen", "ForeName": "Kjeld", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hammer", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larsen", "ForeName": "S\u00f8ren Thor", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nielsen", "ForeName": "Gunnar D", "Initials": "GD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18723085", "10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.07.018", "S0378-4274(08)01197-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
