Four models were developed for the instantaneous O<sub>3</sub> demand, first-order rate constant for the secondary O<sub>3</sub> decay, O<sub>3</sub> exposure (\u222b[O<sub>3</sub>]dt), and OH exposure ((\u222b[OH]dt)), as functions of five independent variables, namely the O<sub>3</sub> dose, concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, alkalinity, and temperature. The models were derived by polynomial regression analysis of experimental data obtained by controlling variables in natural water samples from a single source water (Maegok water in Korea), and they exhibited high accuracies for regression (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.99 for the three O<sub>3</sub> models, and R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.96 for the OH exposure model). The three O<sub>3</sub> models exhibited excellent internal validity for Maegok water samples of different conditions (that were not used for the model development). They also showed acceptable external validity for seven natural water samples collected from different sources (not Maegok water); the IOD model showed somewhat poor external validity. However, the OH exposure model showed relatively poor internal and external validity. The models for oxidant exposures were successfully used to predict the abatement of micropollutants by ozonation; the model predictions showed high accuracy for Maegok water, but not for the other natural waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
