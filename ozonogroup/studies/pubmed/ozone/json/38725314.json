While metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent an attractive platform for HCO, the metal nodes in the unmodified MOFs exhibit low catalytic activity. Herein, we present a perfluorinated Fe-MOF catalyst by substituting H atoms on the metalated ligands with F atoms (termed 4F-MIL-88B) to induce structure evolution. The Lewis acidity of 4F-MIL-88B was enhanced via the formation of Fe nodes, tailoring the electron distribution on the catalyst surface. As a result of catalyst modification, the rate constant for degradation of the target compounds examined increased by \u223c700% compared with that observed for the unmodified catalyst. Experimental evidence and theoretical calculations showed that the modulated polarity and the enhanced electron transfer between the catalyst and ozone molecules contributed to the adsorption and transformation of O<sub>3</sub> to <sup>\u2022</sup>OH on the catalyst surface. Overall, the results of this study highlight the significance of tailoring the metalated ligands to develop highly efficient and stable MOF catalysts for HCO and provide an in-depth mechanistic understanding of their structure-function evolution, which is expected to facilitate the applications of nanomaterial-based processes in water purification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Xiangtong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5087-3972"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for City Cluster Environmental Safety and Green Development of the Ministry of Education, School of Ecology, Environment and Resources, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jinxing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Shikha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5411-3233"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UNSW Centre for Transformational Environmental Technologies (CTET), Yixing, Jiangsu Province 214206, P.R.
