While oceanic iodine emissions decrease at lower sea surface temperatures, the primary contributors to atmospheric iodine can vary from oceanic sources in the summer to other sources in winter. However, the specific sources and their respective contributions have remained unexplored. Fortunately, the atomic ratio of <sup>129</sup>I to <sup>127</sup>I significantly differs between nuclear activity and fossil fuels like coal and petroleum, which formed millions to billions of years ago. This distinction makes <sup>129</sup>I a valuable tool for identifying iodine sources. In our study, we analyzed iodine isotopes and incorporated additional indicators such as element content in PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that in winter inland areas, fuel oil, alongside coal combustion, is a significant source of atmospheric iodine. This research enhances our comprehension of the impact of human activities on iodine levels in the environment. This understanding is crucial not only for addressing iodine deficiency-related health concerns but also for comprehending stratospheric ozone depletion, a phenomenon closely associated with atmospheric iodine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0074-7190"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an AMS Center, State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of AMS Technology and Application, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Yukun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4217-5066"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hongmei", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4851-4858"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an AMS Center, State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of AMS Technology and Application, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Xiaolin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9641-5734"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an AMS Center, State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of AMS Technology and Application, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS, Xi'an 710061, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an Institute for Innovative Earth Environment Research, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Weijian", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an AMS Center, State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of AMS Technology and Application, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Luyuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an AMS Center, State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Shaanxi Key Laboratory of AMS Technology and Application, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fossil Fuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fossil Fuels"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37906162", "10.1021/acs.est.3c05075"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
