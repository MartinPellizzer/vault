Ethylenediurea (EDU) could be a tool to assess ozone damage to vegetation on field scale, but its physiological mode of action remains unclear. This study investigated mechanisms underlying the ozone-protection effect of EDU in controlled chamber experiments. Ozone sensitive and tolerant rice genotypes were exposed to ozone (108\u00a0ppb, 7\u00a0hr\u00a0day<sup>-1</sup> ) and control conditions. EDU alleviated ozone effects on plant morphology, foliar symptoms, lipid peroxidation, and photosynthetic parameters in sensitive genotypes. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing revealed that thousands of genes responded to ozone in a sensitive variety, but almost none responded to EDU. Significant interactions between ozone and EDU application occurred mostly in ozone responsive genes, in which up-regulation was mitigated by EDU application. Further experiments documented ozone degrading properties of EDU, as well as EDU deposits on leaf surfaces possibly related to surface protection. EDU application did not mitigate the reaction of plants to other abiotic stresses, including iron toxicity, zinc deficiency, and salinity. This study provided evidence that EDU is a surface protectant that specifically mitigates ozone stress without interfering directly with the plants' stress response systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashrafuzzaman", "ForeName": "Md", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "Zahidul", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Basharat", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "Boby", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hochholdinger", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Abreu Neto", "ForeName": "Joao Braga", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McGillen", "ForeName": "Max R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nees Institute for Biodiversity of Plants, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ensikat", "ForeName": "Hans-J\u00fcrgen", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stockbridge School of Agriculture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manning", "ForeName": "William J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2474-6558"], "LastName": "Frei", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54924-46-8", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene diurea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salt Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30107647", "10.1111/pce.13423"]}}]}
