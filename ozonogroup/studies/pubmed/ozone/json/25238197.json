The methods used involve seeding and growth on a substrate. Nanorods with various aspect ratios (1-5) and diameters (15-65 nm) are grown. Obtaining highly oriented rods is determined by the way the substrate is mounted within the chemical bath. Furthermore, a preheat and centrifugation step is essential for the optimization of the growth solution. In the best samples, we obtain ZnO nanorods that are almost entirely oriented in the (002) direction; this is desirable since electron mobility of ZnO is highest along this crystallographic axis. When used as the buffer layer of inverted organic photovoltaics (I-OPVs), these one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures offer: (a) direct paths for charge transport and (b) high interfacial area for electron collection. The morphological, structural, and optical properties of ZnO nanorods are studied using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, the surface chemical features of ZnO films are studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. Using as-grown ZnO, inverted OPVs are fabricated and characterized. For improving device performance, the ZnO nanorods are subjected to UV-ozone irradiation. UV-ozone treated ZnO nanorods show: (i) improvement in optical transmission, (ii) increased wetting of active organic components, and (iii) increased concentration of Zn-O surface bonds. These observations correlate well with improved device performance. The devices fabricated using these optimized buffer layers have an efficiency of \u223c3.2% and a fill factor of 0.50; this is comparable to the best I-OPVs reported that use a P3HT-PCBM active layer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Engineering and \u2021Materials Research Center, Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore, Karnataka 560012, India."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Arun D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karalatti", "ForeName": "Suresh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Tiju", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramamurthy", "ForeName": "Praveen C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25238197", "10.1021/am503955k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
