However, when a subsequent thin film is formed on the solidified Ag-paste electrode, there is a fear that the bonding force between the Ag-paste electrode and the subsequent thin film is weakened and peeled off due to the low surface energy of the Agpaste electrode. It is necessary to increase the surface energy of the Ag-paste electrode surface since it ultimately directly affects the yield of the device or product. In this study, the UV/ozone treatment process was introduced to increase the Ag-paste surface energy, thereby making the surface hydrophilic. Additionally, it was confirmed that the UV/ozone treatment process affected only the surface of the Ag-paste electrode by extracting the contact resistance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Faculty of Applied Energy System, Major of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Seongwan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Faculty of Applied Energy System, Major of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yunsook", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Faculty of Applied Energy System, Major of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Sheik Abdur", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Faculty of Applied Energy System, Major of Electronic Engineering, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Woo Young", "Initials": "WY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33714337", "10.1166/jnn.2021.19415"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
