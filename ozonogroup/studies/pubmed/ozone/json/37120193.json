The impact of some emerging non-thermal technologies in food safety and sensory properties has been evaluated. The main technologies applied in the studies are ultrasound, high pressure, supercritical carbon dioxide, ultraviolet, pulsed electric field, cold plasma, ozone and pulsed light. Since there is no single technique that presents high potential for all the evaluated requirements (food safety, sensory, nutritional and the feasibility of implementation in the industry), the search for new technologies to overcome the limitations is fundamental. The high pressure seems to be the most promising technology regarding all the aspects mentioned. Some of the outstanding results are 5 log reduction of E. coli, Listeria and Salmonella, 98.2% of polyphenol oxidase inactivation and 96% PME reduction. However its cost can be a limitation for industrial implementation. The combination of pulsed light and ultrasound could overcome this limitation and provide higher quality fruit juices. The combination was able to achieve 5.8-6.4 log cycles reduction of S. Cerevisiae, and pulsed light is able to obtain PME inactivation around 90%, 61.0 % more antioxidants, 38.8% more phenolics and 68.2% more vitamin C comparing to conventional processing, and similar sensory scores after 45\u00a0days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C comparing to fresh fruit juice. This review aims to update the information related to the application of non-thermal technologies in the fruit juice processing through systematic and updated data to assist in industrial implementation strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
