Catalysts play vital role in AOPs, and Ce-based catalysts have exhibited excellent performance. Recently, the development and application of Ce-based catalysts in various AOPs have been reported. Our study conducts the first review in this rapid growing field. This paper clarifies the variety and properties of Ce-based catalysts. Their applications in different AOP systems (catalytic ozonation, photodegradation, Fenton-like reactions, sulfate radical-based AOPs, and catalytic sonochemistry) are discussed. Different Ce-based catalysts suit different reaction systems and produce different active radicals. Finally, future research directions of Ce-based catalysts in AOP systems are suggested."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
