The biotransformation of HFO-1234ze was investigated after inhalation exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to air containing 2000; 10,000; or 50,000 ppm (n=5/concentration) HFO-1234ze. Male B6C3F1 mice were only exposed to 50,000 ppm HFO-1234ze. All inhalation exposures were conducted for 6 h in a dynamic exposure chamber. After the end of the exposures, animals were individually housed in metabolic cages and urines were collected at 6 or 12 h intervals for 48 h. For metabolite identification, urine samples were analyzed by (1)H-coupled and (1)H-decoupled (19)F-NMR and by LC/MS-MS or GC/MS. Metabolites were identified by (19)F-NMR chemical shifts, signal multiplicity, (1)H-(19)F coupling constants and by comparison with synthetic reference compounds. In urine samples of rats exposed to 50,000 ppm HFO-1234ze, the predominant metabolite was S-(3,3,3-trifluoro-trans-propenyl)-mercaptolactic acid and accounted for 66% of all integrated (19)F-NMR signals in urines. No (19)F-NMR signals were found in spectra of rat urine samples collected after inhalation exposure to 2000 or 10,000 ppm HFO-1234ze likely due to insufficient sensitivity. S-(3,3,3-Trifluoro-trans-propenyl)-l-cysteine, N-acetyl-S-(3,3,3-trifluoro-trans-propenyl)-l-cysteine and 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid were also present as metabolites in urine samples of rats and mice. A presumed amino acid conjugate of 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid was the major metabolite of HFO-1234ze in urine samples of mice exposed to 50,000 ppm and related to 18% of total integrated (19)F-NMR signals. Quantification of three metabolites in urines of rats and mice was performed, using LC/MS-MS and GC/MS. The quantified amounts of the metabolites excreted with urine in both mice and rats, suggest only a low extent (<1% of dose received) of biotransformation of HFO-1234ze and 95% of all metabolites were excreted within 18 h after the end of the exposures (t(1/2) app. 6 h). The obtained results suggest that HFO-1234ze is likely subjected to an addition-elimination reaction with glutathione and to a CYP 450 mediated epoxidation at low rates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Toxikologie, Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Versbacher Str. 9, 97078 W\u00fcrzburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schuster", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bertermann", "ForeName": "R\u00fcdiger", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rusch", "ForeName": "George M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dekant", "ForeName": "Wolfgang", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1,1,3-tetrafluoropropene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Subcellular Fractions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19573548", "10.1016/j.taap.2009.06.018", "S0041-008X(09)00267-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
