For long-term exposures to the former in the outdoor environment a six-month average limit value of 80 micrograms/m3 is recommended for the wintertime. When \"new\" residential areas are planned or when the limit value is used as an air quality standard for the nonindustrial indoor environment, the adequate six-months' average limit value for the winter would be 50 micrograms/m3. For short-term exposures to nitrogen dioxide outdoors a limit value of 320 micrograms/m3 (1-h average) is recommended, not to be exceeded more than 12 h per year, each time during a maximum of 2 h. This value should apply only to \"old\" residential areas in which nitrogen dioxide pollution cannot be reduced without large economical and practical consequences. The value 190 micrograms/m3 (1-h average), not to be exceeded more than 12 h per year, should apply to most residential areas, to recreational areas, and to all nonindustrial indoor environments. For short-term exposures to photochemical oxidants, as represented by ozone in nonindustrial outdoor environments, the acceptable short-term limit value should be 120 micrograms/m3 (1-h average), not to be exceeded more than 12 h per year. An additional 1-h outdoor ceiling value of 200 micrograms/m3 is recommended, not to be exceeded. For the nonindustrial indoor environment a 1-h ceiling value of 100 micrograms/m3 is recommended, not to be exceeded."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lindvall", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Finland", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Work Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7511540", "ISSNLinking": "0355-3140"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maximum Allowable Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microclimate"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}], "NumberOfReferences": "59"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3911380", "2268"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
