Firstly, the optimal preparation parameters of the two intermediates were determined, then the morphology and mineralogy microstructure of the derived Co/Fe-LDO and Co/Al- LDO ozone catalysts were systematically studied. Finally, the reaction kinetics of the two ozone catalysts for the deep degradation of aniline wastewater in catalysts/ozone systems were established. The results showed that the optimal preparation conditions were set as pH\u00a012, temperature 60\u00a0\u00b0C, cobalt\u2011iron ratio 3:1 for Co/Fe-LDH intermediate, and pH\u00a012, temperature 70\u00a0\u00b0C, cobalt\u2011aluminum ratio 3:1 for Co/Al-LDH intermediate. During calcination treatment, the dehydration and recrystallization effect impelled LDH intermediate to form LDO catalyst. The derived ozone catalysts Co/Fe-LDO and Co/Al-LDO possess layered structure, and Co species was mainly based on Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as the main mineral phase of the two ozone catalysts. The addition of catalyst can realize the deep ozonation catalysis of aniline wastewater. The kinetic models established on the aniline oxidized by ozone or catalyst/ozone systems were both fitted the first-order reactions, and the reaction activation energy for COD<sub>Cr</sub> and TOC degradation were significantly reduced in catalyst/ozone system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
