Immediately after 2-h chamber exposures, regional ventilation and particle dosimetry were measured by gamma camera imaging. The vertical distributions of a radiolabeled gas (133Xe) and aerosol (3.5-microns-diam insoluble 99mTc-tagged Fe2O3 particles) were quantitated for upper, middle, and lower lung regions; distribution data were corrected for regional differences in lung volume and tissue attenuation. Indexes of mechanical function, inspiratory capacity, and mid-maximal expiratory flow rates were significantly reduced after O3, but functional residual capacity remained unchanged. Exposure to O3 significantly enhanced the fraction of respired aerosol retained by the lung and altered the distribution pattern of deposited aerosol by increasing particle deposition to the middle lung region (P < 0.05). Aerosol penetration indexes, i.e., ratio of particle deposition in central lung regions to that in peripheral lung regions, and particle retention 24 h postinhalation (an index of aerosol deposition within alveoli and slowly clearing bronchioles) indicated that particle filtration efficiency had increased for tracheobronchial and parenchymal lung regions. For seven of the nine subjects, regional ventilation after O3 was reduced by 14% to the lung base and enhanced by 8 and 6% to the upper and middle lung regions, respectively; these changes were significant (P < 0.02) compared with ventilation after filtered air.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Foster", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silver", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Groth", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01-HL-31429-09", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xenon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-26-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Technetium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Cameras"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Volume Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maximal Midexpiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radionuclide Imaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technetium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xenon Radioisotopes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8307843", "10.1152/jappl.1993.75.5.1938"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
