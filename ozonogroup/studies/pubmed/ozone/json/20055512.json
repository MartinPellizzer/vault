These species occur at low concentration but have been determined to have high cytotoxicity and mutagenicity and therefore may represent a human health hazard. In this study, we have investigated the chemistry involved in the mineralization of HNMs to nonhazardous inorganic products through the application of advanced oxidation and reduction processes. We have combined measured absolute reaction rate constants for the reactions of chloronitromethane, bromonitromethane, and dichloronitromethane with the hydroxyl radical and the hydrated electron with a kinetic computer model in an attempt to elucidate the reaction pathways of these HNMs. The results are compared to measurements of stable products resulting from steady-state (60)Co gamma-irradiations of the same compounds. The model predicted the decomposition of the parent compounds and ingrowth of chloride and bromide ions with excellent accuracy, but the prediction of the total nitrate ion concentration was slightly in error, reflecting the complexity of nitrogen oxide species reactions in irradiated solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aqueous Separations and Radiochemistry Group, Idaho National Laboratory, PO Box 1625, Idaho Falls, Idaho 83415, USA. bruce.mincher@inl.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mincher", "ForeName": "Bruce J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mezyk", "ForeName": "Stephen P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cooper", "ForeName": "William J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cole", "ForeName": "S Kirkham", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fox", "ForeName": "Robert V", "Initials": "RV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gardinali", "ForeName": "Piero R", "Initials": "PR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitro Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "chloronitromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "dichloronitromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EG63P9EUR0", "NameOfSubstance": "bromonitromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L99N5N533T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitro Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20055512", "10.1021/jp907305g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
