These bioactive compounds can cause acute poisoning, and some of them may promote cancer through chronic exposure. Direct ingestion of and contact with contaminated water is one of the many exposure routes to cyanotoxins. The aim of this article was to review the incidence of 13 cancers during a 10-year period in Serbia and to assess whether there is a correlation between the cancer incidences and cyanobacterial bloom occurrence in reservoirs for drinking water supply. The types of cancers were chosen and subjected to epidemiological analyses utilizing previously published data. Based on the epidemiological and statistical analysis, the group of districts in which the incidences of cancers are significant, and may be considered as critical, include Ni\u0161avski, Topli\u010dki, and \u0160umadijski district. A significantly higher incidence of ten cancers was observed in the three critical districts as compared to the remaining 14 districts in Central Serbia. These elevated incidences of cancer include: brain cancer, heart, mediastinum and pleura cancer, ovary cancer, testicular cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, retroperitoneum and peritoneum cancer, leukemia, malignant melanoma of skin, and primary liver cancer. In addition, the mean incidence of five chosen cancers was the highest in the three critical regions, then in the rest of Central Serbia, while the lowest values were recorded in Vojvodina. Persistent and recurrent cyanobacterial blooms occur during summer months in reservoirs supplying water to waterworks in the three critical districts. People in Central Serbia mainly use surface water as water supply (but not all the water bodies are blooming) while in Vojvodina region (control region in this study) only groundwater is used. Among the 14 \"noncritical\" districts, reservoirs used for drinking water supply have been affected by recurrent cyanobacterial blooms in two districts (Rasinski and Zaje\u010darski), but the waterworks in these districts have been performing ozonation for more than 30\u00a0years. We propose that the established statistical differences of cancer incidences in Serbia could be related to drinking water quality, which is affected by cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water reservoirs in certain districts. However, more detailed research is needed regarding cyanobacterial secondary metabolites as risk factors in tumor promotion and cancerogenesis in general."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Sciences , University of Novi Sad , Novi Sad , Serbia."}], "LastName": "Svir\u010dev", "ForeName": "Zorica", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Drobac", "ForeName": "Damjana", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tokodi", "ForeName": "Nada", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu\u017eanin", "ForeName": "Zorana", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Munjas", "ForeName": "Ana Marija", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nikolin", "ForeName": "Branislava", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vuleta", "ForeName": "Du\u0161an", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meriluoto", "ForeName": "Jussi", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health C Environ Carcinog Ecotoxicol Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "9317093", "ISSNLinking": "1059-0501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Serbia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25436472", "10.1080/10590501.2014.967053"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
