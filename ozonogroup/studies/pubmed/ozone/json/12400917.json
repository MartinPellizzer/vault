The adsorbent was a combination of graphitic carbon and a Carboxen-type carbon molecular sieve. The method detection limits (MDLs) for 11 samples were typically 0.5 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) and lower except for bromomethane and chloromethane, both of which exhibited breakthrough. Thirty-day sample storage on the sorbents resulted in less than a 20% change for most compounds, and water management was required for humid samples to avoid major anomalous decreases in response during analyses. The adsorbent-based system, a system using canister-based monitoring, and a semi-continuous automated GC/MS (autoGC) monitoring system with a Tenax GR/Carbotrap B/Carbosieve S-III adsorbent preconcentrator were compared using spiked ozone concentrations as a variable. In this comparison, the target compounds included a number of n-aldehydes as well as those listed in TO-14A. The effects of ozone on the TO-14A compounds were relatively minor with the exception of negative artifacts noted for styrene and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. However, a small, systematic decrease in response was evident for a number of aromatic VOCs and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane when ozone was increased from 50 to 300 ppbv. Method averages for multiple runs under the same conditions were typically within +0.25 ppbv of their mean for most compounds. For n-aldehydes, strong positive artifacts using the autoGC preconcentrator and strong negative artifacts for the canister-based and carbon sorbent approaches caused major disagreement among methods. These artifacts were mostly eliminated by using MnO2 ozone scrubbers, although loss of the n-aldehydes for all methods occurred after a single sample collection of 1 h duration, apparently due to the interaction of the n-aldehydes and products of the O3, MnO2 reaction on the scrubber."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Exposure Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA.
