Dye solutions with concentrations of 10\u00a0ppm for both methylene blue and methyl orange dyes were used. The influence of ozoneation on the performance of photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO nanoparticles for the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions was investigated. To evaluate their efficacy for the removal of methylene blue and methyl orange dyes from aqueous solutions, the photocatalysts were exposed to UV light for 90\u00a0min, with ozone supplied either intermittently or continuously by an SDBD cold plasma reactor. The photocatalysts utilized in this study were characterized using SEM and XRD techniques. The degree of color degradation was determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO nanoparticles exhibit different degrees of photocatalytic activity for the two dyes. The addition of ozone was found to enhance both the color degradation and mineralization rates of the pollutants, with intermittent ozonation proving more effective than continuous ozonation. The most significant color degradation results were obtained using TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with intermittent ozonation for methylene blue dye (97\u00a0%) and ZnO nanoparticles with intermittent ozonation for methyl orange dye (40\u00a0%). Overall, this study provides evidence that photocatalytic ozonation represents a promising technique for water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Optoelectronics Research Center, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nabizadeh", "ForeName": "Reyhaneh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amrollahi", "ForeName": "Rezvaneh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghafary", "ForeName": "Bijan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Optoelectronics Research Center, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Norouzian Alam", "ForeName": "Shahab", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}, "CoiStatement": "We declare that we have no known competing financial or personal relationship that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Taie M., et al.
