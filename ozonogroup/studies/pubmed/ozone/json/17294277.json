The data were obtained from two urban monitoring sites. At both monitoring sites, ambient levels of ozone, NOx, and SO2 were measured. Simultaneously with levels of PM(10) measured at Alsasua (using a laser particle counter), PM(10) levels were also determined at Pamplona (using a beta attenuation monitor). Mean annual PM(10) concentrations in Pamplona and Alsasua reached 30 and 28 microg m(-3), respectively. These concentrations are typical for urban background sites in Northern Spain. By using meteorological information and back trajectories, it was found that the number of exceedances of the daily PM(10) limit as well as the PM(10) temporal variation was highly influenced by air masses from North Africa. Although North African transport was observed on only 9% of the days, it contributed the highest observed PM(10) levels. Transport from the Atlantic Ocean was observed on 68% of the days; transport from Europe on 13%; low transport and local influences on 7%; and transport from the Mediterranean region on 3% of the days. The mean O3 concentrations were 45 and 55 microg m(-3) in Pamplona and Alsasua, respectively, which were above the values reported for the main Spanish cities. The mean NO and NO2 levels were very similar in both sites (12 and 26 microg m(-3), respectively). Mean SO2 levels were 8 microg m(-3) in Pamplona and 5 microg m(-3) in Alsasua. Hourly levels of PM(10), NO and NO2 showed similar variations with the typically two coincident maximums during traffic rush hours demonstrating a major anthropogenic origin of PM(10), in spite of the sporadic dust outbreaks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Soil Science, University of Navarra, Irunlarrea s/n, Pamplona 31080, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zabalza", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogulei", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elustondo", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santamar\u00eda", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alastuey", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Querol", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hopke", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "N Engl J Med. 1993 Dec 9;329(24):1753-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8179653"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2003 May 20;307(1-3):141-65", "ArticleIdList": ["12711431"]}, {"Citation": "Rev Esp Salud Publica. 1999 Mar-Apr;73(2):253-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10410608"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2005 May;59(8):1125-36", "ArticleIdList": ["15833486"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2004 Dec 1;334-335:359-76", "ArticleIdList": ["15504522"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2003 Jul;53(7):789-801", "ArticleIdList": ["12880068"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17294277", "10.1007/s10661-007-9605-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
