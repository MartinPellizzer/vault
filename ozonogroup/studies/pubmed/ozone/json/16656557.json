White Gold). The inhibition appeared to occur at both substrate and electron-transport chain levels. The inhibition increased with the length of exposure to ozone, however, the phosphorylative system was more sensitive to ozone than the respiratory system. With mitochondria from detached leaves after being treated with ozone at 1 ppm for 1 hour, uncoupling of phosphorylation was demonstrated without any detectable change in the rate of respiration in the early stage of ozone effect. Inhibition of phosphorylation by ozone was also demonstrated in isolated mitochondria without apparent change in optical density of the mitochondrial suspension at 520 mmu. Therefore, mitochondrial swelling appears not to be a necessary first step for ozone-induced uncoupling of phosphorylation. The evidence suggests that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria may be a primary effect of ozone in tobacco leaves.Sucrose and glucose, when fed to the detached tobacco leaves before ozone treatment, tended to raise the phosphorylative activity of mitochondria. Mannitol and lactose were less effective."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Canada Department of Agriculture, Research Branch, Research Station, Delhi, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1955 Sep;58(1):52-67", "ArticleIdList": ["13259676"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1958 Nov;33(6):416-20", "ArticleIdList": ["16655160"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1955 Jul;57(1):187-94", "ArticleIdList": ["13239199"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1960 Mar;35(2):205-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16655329"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1952 Sep 20;170(4325):497-9", "ArticleIdList": ["12993213"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1957 Aug 16;126(3268):303-4", "ArticleIdList": ["13454820"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1967", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1967", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1967", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16656557", "PMC1086604", "10.1104/pp.42.5.691"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
