We hypothesized that an acute reduction in [Hb] and haematocrit (Hct) would increase brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). In 11 healthy males (28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years; 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0kg\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> ), FMD (Duplex ultrasound), arterial blood gases, Hct and [Hb], blood viscosity, and NO metabolites (ozone-based chemiluminescence) were measured before and after isovolumic haemodilution, where \u223c20% of whole blood was removed and replaced with 5% human serum albumin. Haemodilution reduced Hct by 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and whole blood viscosity by 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Plasma nitrite (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), S-nitrosothiols (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and total red blood cell NO (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) were collectively reduced by \u223c15-40%. Brachial artery FMD increased by \u223c160% from 3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 to 9.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Statistical covariation for the shear stress stimulus did not alter FMD, indicating that the increase in FMD was not directly related to alterations in whole blood viscosity and the shear stimulus. Collectively, these findings indicate that haemoglobin scavenging of NO appears to be an important factor in the regulation of FMD under normal conditions through constraint of endothelium-dependent NO-mediated vasodilatation in healthy humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Authors.
