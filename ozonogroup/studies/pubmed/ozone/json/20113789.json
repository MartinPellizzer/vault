Past work has employed middle infrared erbium lasers. The present study examined whether near infrared 940 and 980 nm diode lasers (Biolase Ezlase and Sirona Sirolaser, respectively) could induce cavitations in aqueous media.", "Laser energy was delivered into a capillary tube using a 200 microm fiber, and the formation of cavitations observed with a microscope. In the first part of the study, a range of laser parameters were trialled to establish conditions which form cavitations within 5 seconds of the commencement of laser irradiation. The second part of the study compared cavitation in distilled water, aerated tap water, degassed distilled water, ozonated water, 3 and 6% hydrogen peroxide using panel setting of 2.5 W/25 Hz for the Sirolaser, and 4 W/10 Hz for the Ezlase.", "Both diode laser systems could induce cavitation in water-base media by the formation and implosion of water vapour. Laser power played a more important role than pulse frequency or pulse interval. Optimal laser-initiated cavitation occurred when weak (3%) peroxide solutions were used as the target irrigant, rather than water.", "This phenomenon has potential for enhancing debridement in endodontics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2010 American Association of Endodontists.
