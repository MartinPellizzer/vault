Secondary effluent was filtered through different pore-size filters and ozonated at various ozone doses. Degradation of both ozone-reactive and ozone-refractory contaminants improved following ozonation of effluent filtered with smaller pore size filters, indicating that particles in this range may adversely affect ozonation. The inhibitory effect of particles was attributed to their reaction with ozone, reducing available ozone and HO(\u2022) radicals. In addition, increasing filtration level decreased the effluent's (instantaneous) ozone demand and increased removal of effluent UV absorbance (UVA254), further establishing that ozone reacts with effluent particles, in competition with dissolved matter. Moreover, ozone was shown to react with particles even during the first seconds of the process, suggesting a high rate of some ozone-particle reactions, comparable to ozone reaction with highly reactive dissolved organic matter moieties. Particle image analysis revealed that particle formation/aggregation and particle disintegration occurs simultaneously during wastewater (WW) ozonation. Our study implies that particles could affect the efficiency of WW ozonation, by increasing the effluent's ozone demand and decreasing contaminant degradation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel."}], "LastName": "Zucker", "ForeName": "Ines", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lester", "ForeName": "Yaal", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Avisar", "ForeName": "Dror", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "H\u00fcbner", "ForeName": "Uwe", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jekel", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weinberger", "ForeName": "Yigal", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mamane", "ForeName": "Hadas", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25471841", "10.1021/es504314t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
