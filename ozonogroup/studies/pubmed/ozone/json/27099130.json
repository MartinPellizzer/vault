More recently free oxygen radical production following ESW application has been considered to be crucial in shock wave-induced renal damage. It has been shown that ozone therapy (OT) has ameliorative and preventive effects against various pathological conditions due to increased nitro-oxidative stress. In current study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of OT against ESW-induced renal injury.", "Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated, ESW, and ESW\u2009+\u2009OT groups. All groups except sham-operated group were subjected to ESW procedure. ESW\u2009+\u2009OT group received 1\u2009mg/kg/day of oxygen/ozone mixture intraperitoneally at 2\u2009h before ESW, and OT was continued once a day for consecutive three days. The animals were killed at the 4th day, and kidney tissue and blood samples were harvested for biochemical and histopathologic analysis.", "Serum ALT and AST levels, serum neopterin, tissue nitrite/nitrate levels, and tissue oxidative stress parameters were increased in the ESW group and almost came close to control values in the treatment group (p\u2009<\u20090.05, ESW vs. ESW\u2009+\u2009OT). Histopathological injury scores were significantly lower in treatment group than the ESW group (p\u2009<\u20090.05, ESW vs. ESW\u2009+\u2009OT). Immunohistochemical iNOS staining scores in ESW group were higher than those of sham-operated group (p\u2009<\u20090.05, ESW vs. sham-operated), iNOS staining scores in OT group were significantly lower than the ESW group (p\u2009<\u20090.05, ESW\u2009+\u2009OT vs. ESW).", "OT ameliorates nitro-oxidative stress and reduces the severity of pathological changes in the experimental ESW-induced
