These systems are necessary for determining the dose-response relationship of toxicants under a variety of exposure conditions. The objective of this project was to develop a system, employing feedback control, to expose small laboratory animals to precise concentrations of ozone. This system needed the capability of maintaining exposures at selected levels between 0.2 to 3.0 ppm over specified periods ranging between 1 and 8 h in order to evaluate health risks associated with ozone. The overall goals of this study were (1) to develop a system capable of automatically controlling the ozone exposure levels so the steady-state error remained less than 1% and (2) to optimize the system's response time. By employing a tuned control algorithm, gas monitors, data acquisition, and a custom computer software program, these two goals were realized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia 26505, USA. wdm9@cdc.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKinney", "ForeName": "Walter", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frazer", "ForeName": "Dave", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18236221", "10.1080/08958370701758544", "790160639"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
