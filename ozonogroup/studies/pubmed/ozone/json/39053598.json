In this study, ICOB treatment significantly enhanced the removal of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and color by 39\u00a0%, 45\u00a0%, and 52\u00a0%, respectively, outperforming biodegradation. Catalytic ozonation effectively breaking down unsaturated organic substances and high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter into smaller, more biodegradable molecules. Compared with biodegradation, the ICOB system significantly increased the abundances of Pseudomonas, Sphingopyxis, and Brevundimonas by\u00a0\u223c\u00a096\u00a0%, \u223c67\u00a0%, and\u00a0\u223c\u00a085\u00a0%, respectively. These microorganisms, possessing genes for degrading phenol, aromatic compounds, polycyclic aromatics, and sulfur metabolism, further enhanced the mineralization of intermediates. Consequently, the ICOB system outperformed biodegradation and catalytic ozonation treatments, exhibiting chemical oxygen demand removal rate of\u00a0\u223c\u00a058\u00a0% and toxicity reduction of\u00a0\u223c\u00a047\u00a0%. Overall, the ICOB treatment showcases promise for practical engineering applications in coking wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
