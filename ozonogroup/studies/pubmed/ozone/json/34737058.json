All samples were grounded and a cavity prepared followed by random allocation of samples into different disinfection groups i.e., methylene blue photosensitizer (MBP), Silver diamine fluoride (SDF), Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>); curcumin photosensitizer (CP) and chlorhexidine (CHX) (n\u00a0=\u00a015). All samples were restored with resin modified glass ionomer (RMGIC) incrementally. Ten specimens from each group were placed in universal testing machine (UTM) to calculate bond failure and failure type. Five samples from each group were evaluated for microleakage scores. SBS and microleakage scores was examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Post-hoc test. For all tests p-value, less than 0.5 was considered statistically significant.", "The highest SBS was observed in CAD disinfected with CP bonded to RMGIC (16.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.10\u00a0MPa). Similarly, the lowest bond values were demonstrated by CAD disinfected with MBP (9.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0MPa) bonded to RMGIC respectively. CAD disinfected with CHX (Control) bonded to RMGIC demonstrated the lowest microleakage scores and showed a significant difference compared to other experimental groups (p< 0.05).", "Curcumin along with O<sub>3</sub> has the potential to be used as a disinfectant in CAD as it improves SBS to RMGIC. CHX demonstrates low microleakage scores with decrease of bond integrity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
