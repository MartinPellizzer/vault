These metallic compound gases should reveal reactivity with respect to ozone and gas to particle conversion could be obtained in a gas to particle conversion device (GPD) through metal oxides by oxidation. The particles converted were separated from non-reactive gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide in ambient air by a gas exchange device (GED) and the particles in argon, otherwise ICP cannot be maintained, were directly introduced and measured by ICP-MS. Since the technique detects the metallic compound gas directly without any sampling methods, it is expected to be applied to real-time monitoring. This article highlights the research progress and novelty on GPD-GED-ICP-MS for the direct analysis of ultra-trace metallic compound gas. It was also noted that the direct analysis of gaseous Hg at the concentration level of a few ng m<sup>-3</sup> in ambient air mentioned in this article was world-first achieved by GPD-GED-ICP-MS. The research progress for multi-element analysis in suspended particulate matter by GED-ICP-MS was also mentioned since the GED was always used for GPD-GED-ICP-MS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inorganic Standards Group, Research Institute for Material and Chemical Measurement, National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohata", "ForeName": "Masaki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "J-Science Lab Co., Ltd."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishiguchi", "ForeName": "Kohei", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Anal Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8511078", "ISSNLinking": "0910-6340"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29887553", "10.2116/analsci.18SBR01"]}}]}
