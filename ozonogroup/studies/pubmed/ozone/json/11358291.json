While the results obtained during hypochlorite oxidation were not satisfactory (only 35% reduction of colour was achieved at a dose of 6 g dm(-3)), ozonation enabled colour to be reduced by up to 90% (ozone dose 0.5 g dm(-3)). A high decolourisation degree was however accompanied by a low removal (10% efficiency) of chemical oxygen demand (COD). Trials of electrochemical oxidation proved this process much more efficient. Under the conditions of an acidic pH in 40 min of electrolysis a 79% elimination of COD was achieved at the Ti/Pt-Ir anode, which proved the best of seven different tested materials. Simultaneously 90% colour was removed. Indirect oxidation, by means of chlorine-deriving compounds, was the predominating process leading to the pollutants depletion. The best treatment results were obtained with the Fenton process, which under the optimal pH equal to 3 and hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulphide dose of 600 and 550 mg dm(-3), respectively, resulted in a final effluent being colourless and with the residual COD equal to 100 mg dm(-3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Sciences Department, University of Venice, Italy. lidia@unive.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szpyrkowicz", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Juzzolino", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaul", "ForeName": "S N", "Initials": "SN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenton's reagent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "712K4CDC10", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypochlorous Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypochlorous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11358291", "10.1016/s0043-1354(00)00487-5", "S0043-1354(00)00487-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
