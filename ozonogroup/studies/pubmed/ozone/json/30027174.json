Participants' maxillary anterior teeth were treated with ozone (produced via a healOzone X4 device; Curozone) for 60 seconds in Group 1, or with 38% H2O2 for 20 minutes in Group 2. Tooth shades were evaluated by means of a colorimeter (CR-400, Minolta) measuring Vita classic shades in addition to L*a*b* shade values before and following bleaching in each group. A visual analog scale was used to evaluate tooth sensitivity before and after bleaching. Statistically significant differences were identified at P < .05.", "Teeth obtained lighter shades (increased L* and reduced a* and b* values) following bleaching in both groups (P < .001). Both groups revealed comparable bleaching outcomes (P > .05). However, bleaching with ozone did not result in tooth sensitivity, whilst using H2O2 was accompanied with significantly increased bleaching sensitivity (P < .001).", "Similar bleaching outcomes and lighter tooth shades (both for Vita shades and L*a*b* values) were obtained following in-office bleaching with either 60 seconds of ozone or 20 minutes of 38% H2O2. Notwithstanding, tooth sensitivity was significantly increased following bleaching with H2O2 in comparison to ozone. Ozone obviously does reduce the regularly clinically observed inconveniences of bleaching by means of H2O2; thus, ozone would seem worth considering for patients asking for in-office tooth bleaching."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Omiri", "ForeName": "Mahmoud K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lamfon", "ForeName": "Hanadi A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al Nazeh", "ForeName": "Abdullah A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kielbassa", "ForeName": "Andrej M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Quintessence Int", "NlmUniqueID": "0342677", "ISSNLinking": "0033-6572"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30027174", "10.3290/j.qi.a40783", "841147"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
