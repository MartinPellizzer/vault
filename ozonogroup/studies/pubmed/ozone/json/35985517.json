Our results showed that ozonation with gas at both 10 and 100\u00a0ppm concentrations increased the expression of PARP-1 in the fruit during storage. Furthermore, the ozonation process initially increased the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH in the fruit, which corresponds to a higher ATP level. The storage of the fruit in an ozone atmosphere also contributed to increased activity of the NAD<sup>+</sup> kinase, leading to increased levels of NADP<sup>+</sup> . In turn, the higher activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase caused the ozonated fruit to show a higher level of NADPH. However, as the storage period extended and thus with increasing expression of PARP-1 in the ozonated fruit, the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> decreased. In general, the ozonated fruit, which had a higher level of NADPH, showed a higher content of reduced glutathione, which in turn contributed to an increase in the antioxidant activity of the fruit and, ultimately, to a lower accumulation of reactive oxygen species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
