FC(O)O radicals and Cl atoms were generated by laser flash photodissociation of FC(O)OO(O)CF at 193 nm in mixtures with Cl2 and He or SF6 over the total pressure range 8-645 Torr. The measured FC(O)O radical and F atom yields in the photolysis are 0.33 +/- 0.06 and 0.67 +/- 0.06. The reaction lies in the falloff range approaching the high-pressure limit. The extrapolations toward the limiting low- and high-pressure ranges were carried out using a reduced falloff curves formalism, which includes a recent implementation for the strong-collision broadening factors. The resulting values for the low-pressure rate coefficients are (2.2 +/- 0.4) x 10(-28)[He], (4.9 +/- 0.9) x 10(-28)[SF6], (1.9 +/- 0.3) x 10(-28)[Cl2] and (5.9 +/- 1.1) x 10(-28)[FC(O)OO(O)CF] cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1). The derived high-pressure rate coefficient is (4.4 +/- 0.8) x 10(-11) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1). For the reaction Cl + FC(O)OCl --> Cl2 + FC(O)O a rate coefficient of (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-11) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1) was determined. The high-pressure rate coefficient was theoretically interpreted using SACM/CT calculations on an ab initio electronic potential computed at the G3S level of theory. Standard heat of formation values of -99.9 and -102.5 kcal mol(-1) were computed at the G3//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory for cis-FC(O)OCl and trans-FC(O)OCl, respectively. The computed electronic barrier for the conversion between the trans and cis conformers is 8.9 kcal mol(-1). On the basis of the present results, the above reactions are expected to have a negligible impact on stratospheric ozone levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicoqu\u00edmicas Te\u00f3ricas y Aplicadas (INIFTA), Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, CONICET, CICPBA, Casilla de Correo 16, Sucursal 4, (1900) La Plata, Argentina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Badenes", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Croce", "ForeName": "Adela E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cobos", "ForeName": "Carlos J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16509643", "10.1021/jp054591x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
