The sources and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation sensitivity of VOCs during severe ozone pollution episodes were analyzed using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and the photochemical box model coupled with master chemical mechanism (PBM-MCM), respectively. The results revealed that the average volume fractions of total volatile organic compounds were (21.57\u00b13.13)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, with higher volume fractions in winter and spring compared to those in summer and autumn. Among these, alkanes (49.9%) and alkenes (16.4%) accounted for the highest proportion. The PMF analysis results showed that fuel combustion (27.8%), vehicle emission (19.9%), solvent use (15.7%), industrial halogenated hydrocarbon emission (12.1%), chemical enterprise emission (10.5%), natural sources (7.8%), and diesel vehicle emission (6.2%) were the main sources of VOC emissions. Anthropogenic VOCs emitted by solvent use, fuel combustion, and chemical enterprises contributed significantly (60.9% in total) to generating O<sub>3</sub>, which indicates that these three types of anthropogenic sources should be controlled first when it comes to preventing and controlling ozone pollution. Further, the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) and empirical kinetic method approach (EKMA) revealed that O<sub>3</sub> formation was in a VOCs-limited regime during the observation period in Huanggang, China. Furthermore, O<sub>3</sub> formation was more sensitive to <i>m</i>-xylene, <i>p</i>-xylene, ethylene, 1-butene, and toluene; therefore, reducing these VOCs should be prioritized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environment Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Shi-Ze", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environment Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Meng-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eco-Environment Monitoring Centre of Hubei Province, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environment Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Yan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environment Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Hui-Ting", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environment Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Hai-Rong", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37827759", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202211001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
