This study identified and examined the characteristics of chemical compounds emitted in intensive poultry farming (laying hens, broilers) and their toxicity, which led to recommending methods of deodorization. Emphasis was placed on the law relative to air purification in poultry farms. Various methods of air treatment in poultry farms have been described: the modification of animal diet to improve nutrient retention and decrease the amount of their excrement; chemical oxidation technologies (ozonation, photocatalysis, Fenton reaction); various types/brands of biofilters, bioscrubbers and membrane reactors. Numerous studies show that biofilters can reduce ammonia emissions by 51%, hydrogen sulfide by 80%, odors by 67%, while scrubbers brings down ammonia emissions by 77% and odors by 42%, and the application of UV light lowers ammonia emissions by 28%, hydrogen sulfide by 55%, odors by 69% and VOCs by 52%. The paper presents both the solutions currently used in poultry farming and those which are currently in the research and development phase and, as innovative solutions, could be implemented in the near future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
