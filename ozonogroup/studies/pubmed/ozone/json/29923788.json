The effect of different factors, such as ozone concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and initial pH, on the removal rate was studied in detail. The combination of UV with ozone/ H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the MPs degradation. For example, atrazine removal increased from 12.6% to 66.9%. Increasing the concentration of ozone and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can enhance the degradation efficiency of MPs, while excess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays a role as a scavenger for <sup>\u2022</sup>OH. In addition, the optimizing conditions of degradation of MPs by an ozone-based AOP were investigated in this study. The optimal dosages of ozone for atrazine (ATZ), alachlor (ALA), carbamazepine (CBZ), 17-\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and pentachlorophenol (PCP), were in the range of 0.6-0.75, while for ATZ a much higher dosage (5.4\u2005mg/l) is needed. The optimal dosages of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration were at 0.75, 0.2, 0.47, 0.75 and 0.63\u2005mM, and pH were at 10, 10, 7, 10 and 10, and reaction time at 38.5, 33.5 43, 6 and 6 min, respectively. Ozone-based AOP and in particular combination of UV with ozone and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is efficient to degrade atrazine, alachlor, carbamazepine, 17-\u03b1-ethinylestradiol and pentachlorophenol, and is attractive for future application of real wastewater treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ze", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Seyedahmad", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Kortrijk, Belgium."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RUPT, Department of Applied Physics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wardenier", "ForeName": "Niels", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verheust", "ForeName": "Yannick", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2337-1667"], "LastName": "Chys", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5773-7773"], "LastName": "Hulle", "ForeName": "Stijn Van", "Initials": "SV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29923788", "10.1080/09593330.2018.1491630"]}}]}
