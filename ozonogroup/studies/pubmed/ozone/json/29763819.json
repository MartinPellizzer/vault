We conducted a longitudinal panel study to measure personal exposure to ozone using real-time personal ozone monitors. Corresponding ambient ozone concentrations and possible influencing factors (meteorological conditions and activity patterns) were also collected. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze personal-ambient ozone concentration associations and possible influencing factors. Ambient ozone concentrations were around two to three times higher than personal ozone (43.1\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> on average) and their correlations were weak with small slopes (0.35) and marginal R square (R<sub>M</sub><sup>2</sup>) values (0.24). Larger R<sub>M</sub><sup>2</sup> values were found under high temperature (>29.5\u202f\u00b0C), low humidity (<62.1%), good ventilation conditions (>4\u202fh) and for individuals spent longer time outdoors (>0.6\u202fh). In final model, personal ozone exposure was positively associated with ambient concentrations and ventilation conditions, but inversely correlated with ambient temperature and humidity. The models explained >50% of personal ozone concentration variabilities. Our results highlight that ambient ozone concentration alone is not a suitable surrogate for individual exposure assessment. Meteorological conditions (temperature and humidity) and activity patterns (windows opening and outdoor activities) that affecting personal ozone exposure should be taken into account."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
