Although a large quantity of information exists about N2O emissions from various ecosystems, this study was initiated to demonstrate the features of N2O emissions from sea-based waste disposal sites in Osaka City in relation to CH4 emissions. Average N2O emissions at an active landfill (S-Site) were several times higher than those at a closed landfill (N-Site). Average CH4 emissions were also much greater at the S-Site. Regarding the nature of N2O emissions, remarkable emissions often were observed with aerobic waste layers at the N-Site, suggesting almost inversely related N2O emissions with CH4 production at the N-Site. However, at the S-Site a few exceptionally high N2O emissions were noted in cases of high CH4 emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Engineering, Osaka City Institute of Public Health and Environmental Sciences, Osaka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsujimoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masuda", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukuyama", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Air Waste", "NlmUniqueID": "9433394", "ISSNLinking": "1073-161X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15736347", "10.1080/10473289.1994.10467327"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
