Urban Scanner comprises custom vehicle-mounted sensors for air pollution, meteorology, and built environment data collection (low-cost sensors, wind anemometer, 360 deg camera, LIDAR, GPS) as well as a server to store, process, and map all gathered geo-referenced sensory information. Two levels of sensor calibration were implemented, both in a chamber and in the field, against reference instrumentation. Chamber tests and a set of mathematical tools were developed to correct for sensor noise (wavelet denoising), misalignment (linear and nonlinear), and hysteresis removal. Models based on chamber testing were further refined based on field co-location. While field co-location captures natural changes in air pollution and meteorology, chamber tests allow for simulating fast transitions in these variables, like the transitions experienced by a mobile sensor in an urban environment. The best suite of models achieved an R<sup>2</sup> higher than 0.9 between sensor output and reference station observations and an RMSE of 2.88\u00a0ppb for nitrogen dioxide and 4.03\u00a0ppb for ozone. A mobile sampling campaign was conducted in the city of Toronto, Canada, to further test Urban Scanner. We observe that the platform adequately captures spatial and temporal variability in urban air pollution, leading to the development of land-use regression models with high explanatory power."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
