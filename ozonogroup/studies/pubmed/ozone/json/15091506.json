Lit exposed to ozone and ethylenediurea (EDU) in open-top chambers. Plants not treated with EDU showed foliar bronzing due to ozone, while EDU-treated plants were not affected. EDU application modified the reaction of biochemical parameters to ozone. Soluble protein content was elevated by EDU. Peroxidase activity increased with ozone exposure in untreated plants only, while ascorbate-dependent peroxidase activity was lower in EDU treated plants. Catalase activity decreased in EDU-untreated plants. The ratio of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid was significantly increased in EDU treated plants. These results suggest that EDU might induce ascorbic acid synthesis and therefore provide the plant with a very potent antioxidant. Or the content of hydrogen peroxide was reduced due to other unknown processes and caused a delay in foliar senescence, regardless of whether these processes were ozone-induced or due to natural aging processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Plant Ecology, University of Giessen, Heinrich-Buff-Ring 38, D-35392 Giessen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brunsch\u00f6n-Harti", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fangmeier", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00e4ger", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091506", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)00084-q", "0269-7491(94)00084-Q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
