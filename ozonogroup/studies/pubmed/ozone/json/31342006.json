Biomarkers of organophosphate (OP) pesticide exposure (dialkyl phosphates [DAPs]) and asthma exacerbation (leukotriene E4 [LTE4]) were analyzed in samples. Corresponding 24-hour average particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcg (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and maximum 8-hour ozone concentration data for the study period were available from local monitoring stations. We evaluated the independent and multi-pollutant associations between LTE4 and exposure to ambient air pollutants and DAPs using generalized estimating equations. For multi-domain and multi-pollutant models, we created categorized pollution combination levels and estimated the relative health impact of exposure to pollutant mixtures.", "In single-pollutant models, an interquartile range increase in exposures to DAPs was associated with increase in LTE4 levels (\u03b2: 4.1 [0.6-7.6] pg/mg). PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone were also associated with increase in LTE4, though confidence intervals contained the null value. Increase in LTE4 levels was consistently associated with increase in median-dichotomized multi-pollutant combination exposures; the highest effect estimates were observed with joint highest (vs. the lowest) category of the three-pollutant exposure (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, ozone, and OP; \u03b2: 53.5, 95% confidence interval = 24.2, 82.8 pg/mg).", "Concurrent short-term exposure to criteria air pollutants and OPs in an agricultural community was associated with an increase in a marker of asthma morbidity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benka-Coker", "ForeName": "Wande O", "Initials": "WO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Washington."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loftus", "ForeName": "Christine", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Washington."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karr", "ForeName": "Catherine", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magzamen", "ForeName": "Sheryl", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K22 ES023815", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P30 ES007033", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R21 ES017906", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101719527", "ISSNLinking": "2474-7882"}, "CoiStatement": "Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of the article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bloom B, Simpson J.
