The original bioavailability and biosafety of L-PBS was very low. In order to enhance the total bioavailable dissolved organic nitrogen (TB-DON) and total bioavailable dissolved organic phosphorus (TB-DOP), optimum catalytic ozonation of L-PBS conditions were determined using Box-behnken design models (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and intersection tests. The optimal values for ozone concentration, pH value, active catalyst concentration and reaction time were 2.63\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, 6.48, 1.43\u00a0g\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> and 40\u00a0min, respectively. Catalytic ozonation can effectively decompose and transform 68.07% of L-PBS into S-PBS to improve content organic bioavailability, with a molecular weight distribution of 0-1\u00a0kDa (13.53%), 1-5\u00a0kDa (16.62%), 5-10\u00a0kDa (11.16%), 10-30\u00a0kDa (11.73%), 30-100\u00a0kDa (15.04%). Catalytic ozonation of L-PBS can reduce protein levels from 85.28% to 47.18%, but increases the proportion of fulvic and humic components from 10.22% to 32.67% and 4.51%-20.15%, respectively. Because catalytic ozonation changes the internal components and molecular weights of L-PBS, both saw increases in TB-DON and TB-DOP from 3.33% to 41.12% and 2.43%-37.88%, respectively, with a large number of TB-DON and TB-DOP derived from hydrophilic organic components during catalytic ozonation. These important internal mechanisms changed by catalytic ozonation can effectively reduce the ecotoxicity (IR, from 76.5% to 33.1%) and phytotoxicity (GI, enhanced from 35.4% to 70.3%) of L-PBS. Therefore, catalytic ozonation combined with membrane separation is a choice technology in improving the nutrition of biogas slurry and reduce its ecological risk."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
