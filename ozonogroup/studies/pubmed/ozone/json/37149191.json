However, such inland water recycling facilities are challenged with treatment approaches where reverse osmosis (RO) membrane concentrate disposal is a barrier to implementation of potable reuse. To evaluate alternative treatment processes, testing of two side-by-side pilot systems using multi-stage ozone and biological filtration without RO was conducted to compare indirect potable reuse (IPR) to direct potable reuse (DPR). Two water sources were investigated-influent from Lake Lanier for the IPR pilot, and a blend of 25\u00a0% reclaimed water mixed with lake water (75\u00a0%) for the DPR pilot. To assess the nature of organic matter removed during potable reuse, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy/PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) analyses were examined as a fingerprinting tool. The objectives were to determine (a) if a DPR scenario, when preceded by advanced wastewater treatment, could achieve drinking water quality comparable to IPR and (b) if water quality monitoring using EEM/PARAFAC methods could predict results for DPR and IPR water quality, comparable to parameters obtained in a supplementary study that required more expensive, time-consuming, and complicated analytical techniques. Sample scores representing relative concentrations of fluorescing organic matter derived from the EEM-PARAFAC model decreased in the order of reclaimed water > lake water > DPR pilot > IPR pilot, demonstrating that EEM/PARAFAC could distinguish between DPR and IPR water quality. An assessment of a comprehensive list of individual organic compounds (reported separately) validated that blend ratios of 25\u00a0% reclaimed water, or higher mixed with lake water (75\u00a0%) did not meet primary and secondary drinking water standards. Likewise, in this study, EEM/PARAFAC analysis demonstrated the 25\u00a0% blend did not provide drinking water quality indicating this simple, inexpensive method could be used for potable reuse monitoring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
