The FPI provides high spectral resolution and high-throughput capabilities that enable observation in pressure-broadened wings of strong O(3) lines while minimizing the impact of undesirable signal contributions (i.e., from the terrestrial surface and interfering species). A retrieval technique has been implemented and is demonstrated for a tropical atmosphere possessing enhanced tropospheric ozone amounts. An error analysis assessing the impact on retrieved O(3) amounts from the most significant uncertainties associated with this particular measurement has been performed, and findings for a tropical atmosphere are presented. Results show the proposed instrumentation to enable a good measurement of absolute ozone amounts and an even better determination of relative changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larar", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drayson", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18285930", "10.1364/ao.37.004732", "43479"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
