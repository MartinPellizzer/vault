Herein, a continuous ozonation system based on a micro-packed bed reactor (\u03bcPBR) was used to improve the dissolution rate of ozone and achieved a rapid and efficient degradation of refractory organic pollutants. The effects of liquid flow rate, gas flow rate, initial pH, initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration and initial phenol concentration on the phenol and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies were also investigated. Experimental results showed that phenol and COD removal efficiencies under optimal conditions achieved 100.0% and 86.4%, respectively. Compared with large-scale reactors, the apparent reaction rate constant in \u03bcPBR increased by 1-2 orders of magnitude. In addition, some typical organic pollutants (including phenols, antibiotics and dyes) were treated by ozonation in \u03bcPBR. The removal efficiencies of these organic pollutants and COD achieved 100.0% and 70.2%-80.5% within 71\u00a0s, respectively. In this continuous treatment system, 100% of the unreacted ozone was converted to oxygen, which promoted the healthy development of aquatic ecosystems. Thus, this continuous system based on \u03bcPBR is a promising method in rapid and efficient treating refractory organic pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
