To better understand the effects of UV in this range, early signaling events induced by monochromatic UV light were investigated using the chicken B cell line DT40 and mutants lacking protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). Among MAP kinase family proteins, P38 MAP kinase (P38) was selectively and immediately activated by 280 nm UV light in cultured DT40 cells. Activation of P38 was completely inhibited in cells deficient in Lyn and Btk. Introduction of wild-type Btk, but not kinase-inactive Btk, restored the P38 activation. In contrast, P38 activation was not affected in Syk-deficient cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn was induced by 280 nm UV light, and pretreatment of cells with orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), enhanced both Lyn phosphorylation and P38 activation. These results show that Lyn and Btk are upstream regulators of the P38 signaling pathway activated by 280 nm UV light and that the triggering event likely involves inactivation of PTP. Furthermore, cell death induced by 280 nm UV irradiation were augmented by Btk depletion or a specific inhibitor for P38, and partially blocked in Lyn-deficient cells, suggesting that the Lyn-Btk-P38 pathway promotes cell survival while other Lyn pathways stimulate cell death."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomolecular Science, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kabuyama", "ForeName": "Yukihito", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Homma", "ForeName": "Miwako K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurosaki", "ForeName": "Tomohiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Homma", "ForeName": "Yoshimi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Syk Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.2", "NameOfSubstance": "lyn protein-tyrosine kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.2", "NameOfSubstance": "src-Family Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OU13V1EYWQ", "NameOfSubstance": "SB 203580"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Syk Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "src-Family Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11856326", "10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02698.x", "2698"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
