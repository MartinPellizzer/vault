Some wavelengths of UV light can produce high concentration of O<sub>3</sub>. UV irradiation combined with O<sub>3</sub> may have great potential for nitration of allergens in the presence of NO<sub>2</sub> in the air. In this study, the effects of UV irradiation on the nitration of three major indoor allergens including group \u2160 allergens of house dust mite (Der p 1 and Der f 1) and group \u2160 allergen of dog (Can f 1) in the presence of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were investigated by analysis of the protein quantity, tyrosine, peptides, and nitration degree. The results showed that UV irradiation induced a significant increase in the quantity of 3-nitrotyrosine in the allergens from 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0ng to 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0ng. After 12\u00a0h of UV-O<sub>3</sub> co-exposure, the total nitration degrees of the three allergens ranged from 0.1% to 0.5%, which were significantly higher than those after only O<sub>3</sub> exposure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The analysis of peptides revealed that the nitration of tyrosine was site-specific. The tyrosine Y<sub>231</sub>, which was adjacent to aspartic acid, posed the highest nitration degree of 41.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.0% in Der p 1. The nitration degree of tyrosine Y<sub>162</sub> was the highest (1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1%) in Der f 1. Overall, this study demonstrated that UV irradiation enhanced the O<sub>3</sub>-related nitration of allergens in the air, which provides an experimental basis for the impact of daily disinfection behavior on allergens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
