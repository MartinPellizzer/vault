Both O<sub>3</sub> and aerosol particles are short-lived climate forcers and impact the radiative balance of the planet, and their sources and sinks are chemically complex. However, the biosphere also acts as a deposition sink for organic and inorganic compounds, including O<sub>3</sub>, aerosols, and their precursors. Wet and dry deposition provides a key lever on the lifetime of trace gases and particles in the atmosphere and thus on their potential to influence the radiative balance of the planet. The fluxes of reactive trace gases and particles are part of an atmospheric biogeochemical cycle that includes feedbacks through drought and other climate components.Recent advances in measurement techniques have enabled new field observations of trace gas and particle fluxes. Our method development has focused on the leaf, branch, and forest level, although satellite measurements coupled to modeling also provide promising new approaches to constraining trace gas fluxes. Leaf chamber measurements of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions highlight leaf-to-leaf and plant-to-plant variability in both photosynthesis and emissions of individual VOCs, in addition to differences in emissions across different isomers of monoterpenes. Isomers obviously have different chemical properties (e.g., reaction rates with OH radicals, SOA yield) and thus hold different potentials as precursors for short-lived climate forcers.The biosphere acts as both sources and sinks of the oxidation products of monoterpenes and other biogenic VOCs. Developments in chemical ionization mass spectrometry have recently enabled measurements of volatile organic acids, which demonstrate a strong temperature-dependent ecosystem source, as well as a source from in-canopy chemistry. In-canopy chemistry also influences particle fluxes, although deposition should dominate their net exchange. Our field observations of chemically resolved particle fluxes demonstrate the simultaneous, competing processes driving forest exchange. To separate out these competing processes, we use black carbon as an inert tracer for particle deposition. Our recent measurements demonstrate the importance of wet deposition in controlling particle lifetime in the atmosphere. Overall, new measurement techniques have enabled both field and laboratory observations to improve our understanding of biosphere-atmosphere interactions and their influence on climate processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6470-9970"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Farmer", "ForeName": "Delphine K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Riches", "ForeName": "Mj", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acc Chem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0157313", "ISSNLinking": "0001-4842"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32687308", "10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
