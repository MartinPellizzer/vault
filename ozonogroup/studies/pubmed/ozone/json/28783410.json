Bamboo-based activated carbon (AC) was dipped in acid and oxidized in a mixture of potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid. Oxidation treatment considerably improved the physicochemical properties of AC, including purity, pore structure and surface nature, significantly enhancing BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> adsorption capacity. AC with many oxygenated groups and a high mesopore volume exhibited a particularly favorable tendency for BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> adsorption. Its adsorption of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is best fitted using Langmuir isotherm, and forms a monolayer. A kinetic investigation revealed that the adsorption of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by the ACs involved chemical sorption and was controlled by intra-particle diffusion. The competitive effects of natural organic matter (NOM) on AC were evaluated, and found to reduce the capacity of carbon to adsorb BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Residual dissolved ozone reacted with AC, reducing its capacity to absorb BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Proper dosing and staging of the ozonation processes can balance the ozone treatment efficiency, BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation, and the subsequent removal of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Science and Engineering , Tunghai University , Taichung , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ho-Wen", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Science and Engineering , Tunghai University , Taichung , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chuang", "ForeName": "Yen Hsun", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Safety, Health, and Environmental Engineering , Hungkuang University , Taichung , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "Cheng-Feng", "Initials": "CF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Safety, Health, and Environmental Engineering , Hungkuang University , Taichung , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Winn-Jung", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sasa"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28783410", "10.1080/10934529.2017.1340750"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
