This work reports the size-segregated concentrations of total Cr(VI) in particulate matter (PM) in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, and provides new insights into the gas-solid reactions of atmospheric Cr. A study of total Cr(VI) in the particulate matter, via a microwave-assisted digestion technique, was conducted using a 5-stage Sioutas Cascade impactor that captures airborne particles in size ranges: >2.5\u00a0\u03bcm, 1.0-2.5\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.50-1.0\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.25-0.50\u00a0\u03bcm, and <0.25\u00a0\u03bcm. The total Cr(VI) concentration in the size fraction <0.25\u00a0\u03bcm was the highest with a maximum value of 9.7\u00a0ng/m<sup>3</sup>. This high concentration may pose a greater risk because smaller airborne particles can penetrate deeper into the lower respiratory tract of the lungs. Total suspended particles Cr(VI) exceeded the 8.0\u00a0ng/m<sup>3</sup> Reference Concentration (RfC) by 22 times. The overall total Cr(VI) concentration in summer was significantly higher than in fall (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which could be due to factors, including higher temperatures, ozone, and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in summer and a higher VOC concentration in fall. The results indicate that the interaction between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) through gas-solid reaction can control the speciation of atmospheric Cr."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
