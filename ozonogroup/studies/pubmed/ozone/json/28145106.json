Order-of-magnitude increases in fertilizer use are seen as a critical step in attaining food security. This increase represents an unprecedented input of nitrogen (N) to African ecosystems and will likely be accompanied by increased soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a precursor to tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Emissions of NO from soils occur primarily during denitrification and nitrification, and N input rates are a key determinant of emission rates. We established experimental maize plots in western Kenya to allow us to quantify the response function relating NO flux to N input rate during the main 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. NO emissions followed a sigmoid response to fertilizer inputs and have emission factors under 1% for the roughly two-month measurement period in each year, although linear and step relationships could not be excluded in 2011. At fertilization rates above 100\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup> , NO emissions increased without a concomitant increase in yields. We used the geos-chem chemical transport model to evaluate local impacts of increased NO emissions on tropospheric ozone concentrations. Mean 4-hour afternoon tropospheric ozone concentrations in Western Kenya increased by up to roughly 2.63\u00a0ppbv under fertilization rates of 150\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup> or higher. Using AOT40, a metric for assessing crop damage from ozone, we find that the increased ozone concentrations result in an increase in AOT40 exposure of approximately 110\u00a0ppbh for inputs of 150\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup> during the March-April-May crop growing season, compared with unfertilized simulations, with negligible impacts on crop productivity. Our results suggest that it may be possible to manage Kenyan agricultural systems for high yields while avoiding substantial impacts on air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Earth Institute of Columbia University, 61 Route 9W, Lamont Hall, PO Box\u00a01000, Palisades, NY, 10964, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7246-642X"], "LastName": "Hickman", "ForeName": "Jonathan E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geological & Mining Engineering & Sciences, Michigan Technological University, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI, 49931, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Now at the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University, 195 Prospect St., New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yaoxian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geological & Mining Engineering & Sciences, Michigan Technological University, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI, 49931, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Michigan Technological University, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI, 49931, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shiliang", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Millennium Village Project, Milimani Block 10/35, Busia Road, PO\u00a0Box\u00a02389-40100, Kisumu, Kenya."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diru", "ForeName": "Willy", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, 2801 Sharon Turnpike, PO Box\u00a0AB, Millbrook, NY, 12545, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center and Brooklyn College Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, 85 St. Nicholas Terrace, 5th Floor, New York, NY, 10031, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Groffman", "ForeName": "Peter M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Maryland, 2108 Plant Sciences Building, College Park, MD, 20742, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tully", "ForeName": "Katherine L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Earth Institute of Columbia University, 61 Route 9W, Lamont Hall, PO Box\u00a01000, Palisades, NY, 10964, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Now at the University of Florida, P.O.
