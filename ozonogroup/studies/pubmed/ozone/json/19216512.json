These complexes were fully characterized by absorption, (1)H, (2)H, and (19)F NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectroscopy. The characteristic absorption peak of compound I at approximately 650 nm was found to be a good marker for estimation of the electron donor effect from the axial ligand. The axial ligand effect did not change the porphyrin pi-cation radical state, the a(2u) state of the TMP complexes, or the a(1u) radical state of both the TMTMP complexes and compound I. The ferryl iron and porphyrin pi-cation radical spins were effectively transferred into the axial ligands for the a(2u) complexes but not for the a(1u) complexes. Most importantly, the reactivity of the oxoiron(IV) porphyrin pi-cation radical complex was drastically increased by the imidazole and phenolate axial ligands. The reaction rate for cyclooctene epoxidation was increased 100- to 400-fold with axial coordination of imidazoles and phenolate. A similar increase was also observed for the oxidation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene,N,N-dimethyl-p-nitroaniline and hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest extreme enhancement of the reactivity of compound I by the axial ligand in heme enzymes. The functional role of axial ligands on the compound I in heme enzymes is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Science and Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, and Department of Functional Molecular Science, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Myodaiji, Okazaki 444-8787, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurahashi", "ForeName": "Takuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujii", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inorg Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0366543", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1669"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Porphyrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "porphyrin pi cation radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14127-53-8", "NameOfSubstance": "ferryl iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7GBN705NH1", "NameOfSubstance": "imidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7YNJ3PO35Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Imidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Porphyrins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19216512", "10.1021/ic802123m", "10.1021/ic802123m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
