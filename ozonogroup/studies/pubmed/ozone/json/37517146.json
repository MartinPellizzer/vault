However, owing to large spatial heterogeneity and discrete measurements, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from estuaries are considerably uncertain. Microbial processes are disputed in terms of the dominant N<sub>2</sub>O production under severe human disturbance. Herein, combining real-time and high-resolution measurements with bioinformatics analysis, we accurately mapped the consecutive two-dimensional N<sub>2</sub>O distribution in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China, and revealed its underlying microbial mechanisms. Both the horizontal and vertical distributions of N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations varied greatly at fine scales. Supersaturated N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations (9.1 to 132.2\u00a0nmol/L) in the surface water decreased along the estuarine salinity gradient, with several emission hotspots scattering upstream. The vertical N<sub>2</sub>O distribution showed marked differences from complete mixing upstream to incomplete mixing downstream, with constant or changeable concentrations with increasing depth. Furthermore, spatially varied denitrifying and nitrifying microorganisms controlled the N<sub>2</sub>O production and distribution in the PRE, with denitrification playing the dominant role. The nirK-type and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria were the primary producers of N<sub>2</sub>O in the water and sediment columns, respectively. In addition, substrate concentration (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and DOC) regulated N<sub>2</sub>O production by affecting key microbial processes, while physical influences (water-mass mixing and salt wedges) reshaped N<sub>2</sub>O distribution. With these information, a conceptual model of estuarine N<sub>2</sub>O production and distribution was constructed to generalize the possible biochemical processes under environmental constraints, which could provide insights into the N<sub>2</sub>O biogeochemical cycle and emission mitigation from a mechanistic perspective."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
