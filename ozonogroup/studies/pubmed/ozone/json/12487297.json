The segregated hydrofluoroethers belong to a class of fluorochemicals currently being proposed as replacements for traditional fluorochemicals (CFCs and PFCs) that are currently being used in several industries, in particular, the semiconductor industry. These traditional compounds have been implicated as ozone-depleting or potent \"greenhouse gases\". The segregated hydrofluoroethers have useful physical and chemical properties, but do not contribute to ozone depletion and have lower \"global warming potential\" (GWP) indices. Although the physical properties of these materials (low H2O solubility and high vapor pressure) suggest there would be a very low level of risk to aquatic systems, a thorough analysis had not been previously performed. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of HFE-7500 in Japan were determined with the Higashino model, a Gausian puff and plume model that used an approximation of environmental releases to the atmosphere as input to the model. Allowable concentrations to protect aquatic life, wildlife, and humans from noncancer effects were determined as detailed in USEPA's final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes Systems. Potential risk to ecological receptors and humans was determined by calculating hazard quotients and margins of safety. The results of the risk assessment indicate that HFE-7500 poses no significant risk to either aquatic or terrestrial wildlife species or humans living in the Japanese environment. The least margin of safety for any ecological receptor was 100,000, and a margin of safety greater than 100,000,000 for most receptors indicated that HFE-7500 poses no threat to human health. Because of a scarcity of toxicity and exposure data, the risk assessment was based on very conservative assumptions. Therefore, the actual margins of safety for both humans and wildlife could have been 100- to 1,000-fold greater if additional data were available such that less stringent uncertainty factors could be applied. These results suggest that the environmental impact of HFE-7500 should be inconsequential based on the marked improvement in its atmospheric properties relative to the traditional compounds currently in use. Given the short atmospheric lifetime and low global warming potential of this material, its replacement of CFCs and PFCs would result in a net improvement of environmental health and safety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ENTRIX, Inc., 4295 Okemos Road, Suite 101, Okemos, Michigan 48864, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newsted", "ForeName": "John L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakanishi", "ForeName": "Junko", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cousins", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Werner", "ForeName": "Kurt", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giesy", "ForeName": "John P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HFE-7500"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Sci Technol. 2003 Mar 15;37(6):1228"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Wild"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12487297", "10.1021/es0257321"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
