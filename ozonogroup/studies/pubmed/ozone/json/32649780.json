With this in mind, we recruited forty-three children with asthma from suburban Shanghai and deployed air cleaners (with HEPA and activated carbon filters) in their bedrooms. During both 2-week filtration and non-filtration periods, low-cost PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> air monitors were used to measure pollutants indoors, outdoors, and for personal exposure. Indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were reduced substantially with the use of air cleaners, from 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017 to 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> , with roughly 80% of indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimated to come from outdoor sources. Personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> was reduced from 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017 to 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> . The more modest reductions in personal exposure and high contribution of outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> to indoor concentrations highlight the need to reduce outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> and/or to clean indoor air in multiple locations. Indoor O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were generally low (mean\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b14\u00a0ppb), and no significant difference was seen by filtration status. The concentrations of pollutants and the air cleaner effectiveness were highly variable over time and across homes, highlighting the usefulness of real-time air monitors for understanding individual exposure reduction strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
