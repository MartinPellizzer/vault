Air pollution and prolonged exposure to airborne contaminants have been implicated in various respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the specific impact of air pollution on pneumonia, particularly CAP, remains underexplored. Given the rising levels of urban air pollution and its potential health ramifications, our study aimed to examine the association between exposure to outdoor air pollution and severity as well as the outcomes of pneumonia cases requiring hospitalization. Methodology A cohort analytical study with retrospective data collection was carried out in the pulmonology department of the Gab\u00e8s University Hospital between January and October 2022. We compared levels of particulate matter less than or equal to 10\u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>),\u00a0sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>),\u00a0ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), moisture and ambient temperature with severity and outcomes of\u00a0pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The choice of these specific pollutants and environmental factors was based on their established impact on respiratory health and their prevalence in the study region. Results Increased sulfur dioxide (SO2) levels were associated with increased use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (r = 0.400). Higher levels of particulate matter (PM10) were significantly associated with the development of lung abscesses. Similarly, increased humidity and ambient temperature were strongly correlated with the development of lung abscesses. Increased air SO2 levels were correlated with a higher CURB65 score (r = 0.299). High outdoor SO2 levels and increasing moisture content were associated with increased Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) score (r = 0.303 and = 0.310, respectively). Higher levels of PM10 were associated with an increased risk of pleural effusion, a serious complication of pneumonia. Finally, higher ambient temperatures were correlated with more extensive opacities on chest X-rays (r = 0.706), suggesting the severity of pneumonia. Conclusion This study highlights the significant associations between environmental factors and various clinical parameters in pneumonia patients. The findings underscore the importance of considering environmental exposures, such as air quality and weather conditions, in understanding and managing the severity of pneumonia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Kwas et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pulmonology, University Hospital of Gab\u00e8s, Gab\u00e8s, TUN."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwas", "ForeName": "Hamida", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry, Haveri Institute of Medical Sciences, Haveri, IND."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rangareddy", "ForeName": "Harish", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analysis Laboratory Research, University Hospital of Gab\u00e8s, Gab\u00e8s, TUN."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajhi", "ForeName": "Hayfa H", "Initials": "HH", "Suffix": "Sr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "Human subjects: All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve human participants or tissue.
