The removal efficiency and the intermediate products were studied during the ozonation of nonylphenol, the possible reaction mechanism of the ozonation of nonylphenol was proposed. The experimental results indicate that there are two kinds of ozonation patterns, the oxidation by molecule O3 alone and by O3/*OH. Both ozonation patterns can remove nonylphenol completely within 18 minutes. However, the combined oxidation can remove 96% of the initial nonylphenol within 4 minutes, and it took 12 minutes in the single O3 molecule oxidation system. The formaldehyde was detected during the ozonation of nonylphenol. The concentration reached stability after 8 minutes during the oxidation by single O3 and gradually increased during the combined oxidation process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pi", "ForeName": "Yun-Zheng", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiang-Long", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79F6A2ILP5", "NameOfSubstance": "nonylphenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17633637"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
