The results showed that the spotaneous oxidation of As(III) to As(V) was very slow and could not be enhanced by aerating for 24 h. The removal rate of As(III) could reach that of As(V) when pre-aerating water samples with ozone for 60 s, putting 7.5 ml/L hydrogen peroxide solution, adding 2.5 mg/L javelle water (sodium hypochlorite) or 15 mg/L bleaching powder(numerated by chlorine). The oxidation by using javelle water was rather stable when samples were varied in pH value, hardness, initial concentration of As(III) and As(III)/As(V) ratio. The effective oxidation could be reached with 1.25 mg/L javelle water when the initial concentration of As(III) was < or = 0.8 mg/L. Moreover, the field study also confirmed the oxidation effect of javelle water. It is suggested that javelle water is an effective, economic and technologic feasible oxidationagent for removing arsenite from dispersed drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Science and Technology University, Wuhan 430030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Yan Jiu", "NlmUniqueID": "9426367", "ISSNLinking": "1000-8020"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N5509X556J", "NameOfSubstance": "arsenite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenites"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11321952"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
