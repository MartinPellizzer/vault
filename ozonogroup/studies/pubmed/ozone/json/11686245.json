In this paper, we present results from the laboratory and field evaluation of several new (or modified) samplers used in the \"roll-around\" system (RAS), which was developed to measure 1-hr O3, PM2.5, and CO exposures simultaneously. All the field evaluation data were collected during two sampling seasons: the summer of 1998 and the winter of 1999. To measure 1-hr O3 exposures, a new active O3 sampler was developed that uses two nitrite-coated filters to measure O3 concentrations. Laboratory chamber tests found that the active O3 sampler performed extremely well, with a collection efficiency of 0.96 that did not vary with temperature or relative humidity (RH). In field collocation comparisons with a reference UV photometric monitor, the active O3 sampler had an effective collection efficiency ranging between 0.92 and 0.96 and a precision for 1-hr measurements ranging between 4 and 6 parts per billion (ppb). The limits of detection (LOD) of this method were 9 ppb-hr for the chamber tests and approximtely 16 ppb-hr for the field comparison tests. PM2.5 and CO concentrations were measured using modified continuous monitors--the DustTrak and the Langan, respectively. A size-selective inlet and a Nafion dryer were placed upstream of the DustTrak inlet to remove particles with aerodynamic diameters greater than 2.5 microm and to dry particles prior to the measurements, respectively. During the field validation tests, the DustTrak consistently reported higher PM2.5 concentrations than those obtained by the collocated 12-hr PM2.5 PEM samples, by approximately a factor of 2. After the DustTrak response was corrected (correction factor of 2.07 in the summer and 2.02 in the winter), measurements obtained using these methods agreed well with R2 values of 0.87 in the summer and 0.81 in the winter. The results showed that the DustTrak can be used along with integrated measurements to measure the temporal and spatial variation in PM2.5 exposures. Finally, during the field validation tests, CO concentrations measured using the Langan were strongly correlated with those obtained using the reference method when the CO levels were above the LOD of the instrument [approximately 1 part per million (ppm)]."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "L T", "Initials": "LT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolfson", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Catalano", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11686245"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
