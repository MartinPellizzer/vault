A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was used to investigate the environmental impact categories of processed tea based on the cradle to gate approach, i.e., from production of input materials using raw materials to the gate of tea processing units, i.e., packaged tea. Thus, all the tea processing operations such as withering, rolling, fermentation, drying, and packaging were considered in the analysis. The initial data were obtained from tea processing units while the required data about the background system was extracted from the EcoInvent 2.2 database. LCA results indicated that diesel fuel and corrugated paper box used in drying and packaging operations, respectively, were the main hotspots. Black tea processing unit caused the highest pollution among the three processing units. Three feed-forward back-propagation ANN models based on Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm with two hidden layers accompanied by sigmoid activation functions and a linear transfer function in output layer, were applied for three types of processed tea. The neural networks were developed based on energy equivalents of eight different input parameters (energy equivalents of fresh tea leaves, human labor, diesel fuel, electricity, adhesive, carton, corrugated paper box, and transportation) and 11 output parameters (yield, global warming, abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and photochemical oxidation). The results showed that the developed ANN models with R <sup>2</sup> values in the range of 0.878 to 0.990 had excellent performance in predicting all the output variables based on inputs. Energy consumption for processing of green tea, oolong tea, and black tea were calculated as 58,182, 60,947, and 66,301\u00a0MJ per ton of dry tea, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Machinery Engineering, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran. khanali@ut.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Khanali", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Machinery Engineering, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mobli", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Machinery Engineering, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh-Bandbafha", "ForeName": "Homa", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2011 Oct;92(10):2277-86", "ArticleIdList": ["21616581"]}, {"Citation": "Food Nutr Res. 2010 Nov 19;54:null", "ArticleIdList": ["21103078"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2013 Nov 19;47(22):12632-47", "ArticleIdList": ["24152032"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2004 Feb 1;38(3):657-64", "ArticleIdList": ["14968848"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Int. 2004 Sep;30(7):981-90", "ArticleIdList": ["15196846"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2017 Feb;24(5):4812-4821", "ArticleIdList": ["27987119"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28965294", "10.1007/s11356-017-0234-5", "10.1007/s11356-017-0234-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
