In this study, catalytic ozonation by regenerated granular activated carbon (rGAC) and its combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) was investigated for the reclamation of a real bio-treated dyeing and finishing wastewater (BDFW). Catalytic ozonation by rGAC (O<sub>3</sub>/rGAC) was 1.6-2.0 times more efficient than ozonation alone for pollutants degradation. Although iron oxide loaded rGAC (rGAC-Fe) improved the performance of catalytic ozonation by 14%-25%, but was labile (<2 days) compared to stable rGAC (>20 days). Catalytic ozonation improved the generation of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, contributing 1.1-1.7 times faster of chromophores decomposition and 0.24-0.55 times more increase of biodegradability than ozonation. However, catalytic ozonation increased the acute toxicity of BDFW by two times. The combination of O<sub>3</sub>/rGAC and BAC can synergistically reduce COD, chromophores, and color in BDFW during 45-day's continuous operation, the improvements than O<sub>3</sub>/rGAC being 21.0%, 18.8%, and 13.6%, respectively. Moreover, although O<sub>3</sub>/rGAC of BDFW increased the toxicity from 98.3 to 146.5\u202f\u03bcg-HgCl<sub>2</sub>/L, post BAC significantly reduced the toxicity to 13.1\u202f\u03bcg-HgCl<sub>2</sub>/L. Engineering practice of water reclamation by O<sub>3</sub>/rGAC-BAC was approved to be feasible based on both the water quality of treated water and the operation cost."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
