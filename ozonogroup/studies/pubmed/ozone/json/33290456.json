The use of silver (Ag) and hydrogen (H) OnGuard cartridges and 100-fold dilution were found to be simple and effective for sample pretreatment. Under optimized MS parameters, method validation was convincingly confirmed. A good linearity was obtained with regression correlation coefficients (R2) larger than 0.999. The mean relative recoveries of chlorite (ClO2-), chlorate (ClO3-), perchlorate (ClO4-), and bromate (BrO3-) ranged from 79.96 to 97.63%. The obtained limit of detection (LOD) was 1.00 \u03bcg L-1 for ClO2-, 0.10 \u03bcg L-1 for ClO3-, 0.04 \u03bcg L-1 for ClO4-, and 0.50 \u03bcg L-1 for BrO3-. Chlorate and bromate were only detected in ozonated samples. In addition, the concentration of chlorate and bromate was in direct proportion to the amount of ozone in saline."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Optic-electric Sensing and Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Ministry of Education, Shandong Key Laboratory of Biochemical Analysis, Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science in Universities of Shandong, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China. qdshyniu@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Xiuzhen", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "He", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Sa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Shuyan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33290456", "10.1039/d0ay01903h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
