After adequate development of the pulmonary emphysema, the animals were initially exposed to 1.9 ppm ozone for 3 hrs, and 3 days later, challenge-exposed to 5.1 ppm ozone for 3 hrs and immediately sacrificed to investigate the extent of the development of tolerance to ozone judged by the formation of edema. Although the body weights of the pulmonary emphysematous rats were the same as those of the saline-treated control rats, the lung weights of the former were heavier. The extent of the edema formation by ozone and of the tolerance to ozone of the pulmonary emphysematous rats seemed to be quite similar to those of the saline-treated control rats. On the other hand, although the exposure of the saline-treated control rats to 1.9 ppm ozone for 3 hrs resulted in an increase in lung weight without edema 3 days after the exposure, the pulmonary emphysematous rats did not show such a response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nambu", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yokoyama", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Sangyo Igaku", "NlmUniqueID": "0150531", "ISSNLinking": "0047-1879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.36", "NameOfSubstance": "Pancreatic Elastase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatic Elastase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Emphysema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3851865", "10.1539/joh1959.27.105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
