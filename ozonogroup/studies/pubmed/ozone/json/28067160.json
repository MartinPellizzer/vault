Because all chambers may not necessarily produce similar results (e.g., due to differences in sink effects, temperature and humidity control, air exchange, pollutant monitoring, and measurement biases), a preliminary four-laboratory evaluation of the revised test method was conducted. To minimize variability, the evaluation used a single dry-process photocopier that was shipped to each of the four laboratories along with supplies (i.e., toner and paper). The results of this preliminary four-laboratory evaluation demonstrate that the test method was used successfully in the different chambers to measure emissions from dry-process photocopiers. Differences in chamber design and construction appeared to have had minimal effect on the results for the volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Perhaps more important than the chamber itself is the sample analysis as identified by duplicate samples that were analyzed by a different laboratory. Percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) was used to provide a simplistic view of interlaboratory precision for this evaluation. Excluding problems with suspected analytical bias observed from one of the laboratories, the precision was excellent for the VOCs with RSDs of less than 10% in most cases. Less precision was observed among the laboratories for aldehydes/ketones (RSD of 23.2% for formaldehyde). The precision for ozone emission rates among three of the laboratories was excellent (RSD of 7.9%), but emission rates measured at the fourth laboratory were much higher."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , National Risk Management Research Laboratory , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leovic", "ForeName": "Kelly", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Triangle Institute , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whitaker", "ForeName": "Don", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Triangle Institute , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Northeim", "ForeName": "Coleen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , National Exposure Research Laboratory , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheldon", "ForeName": "Linda", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28067160", "10.1080/10473289.1998.10463750"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
