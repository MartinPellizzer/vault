We examined air pollution levels and neurologic symptoms among 21,467 adults in US Gulf Coast states. We assigned exposure using Environmental Protection Agency estimates of daily ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone. Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study participants reported neurologic symptoms at enrollment (2011-2013). We estimated cross-sectional associations between each air pollutant and prevalence of \"any\" neurologic, central nervous system (CNS), or peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms. Ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> was consistently associated with prevalence of neurologic symptoms. The highest quartile of 30-day PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with any neurologic symptom (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09, 1.23) and there were increasing monotonic relationships between 30-day PM<sub>2.5</sub> and each symptom category (<i>P</i>-trend \u2264 0.01). Associations with PM<sub>2.5</sub> were slightly stronger among nonsmokers and during colder seasons. The highest quartile of 7-day ozone was associated with increased prevalence of PNS symptoms (PR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.19; <i>P</i>-trend = 0.03), but not with other outcomes. Ozone concentrations above regulatory levels were suggestively associated with neurologic symptoms (PR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.99, 1.14). Mutual adjustment in co-pollutant models suggests that PM<sub>2.5</sub> is more relevant than ozone in relation to prevalence of neurologic symptoms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
