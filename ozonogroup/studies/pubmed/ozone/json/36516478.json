Annual mean residential concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), as well as 8 PM<sub>2.5</sub> components (copper, iron, potassium, nickel, sulphur, silicon, vanadium, zinc), for 2010 were estimated using Europe-wide hybrid land use regression models. PD mortality was defined as underlying cause of death being either PD, secondary Parkinsonism, or dementia in PD. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to investigate the associations between air pollution and PD mortality, adjusting for potential confounders.", "Of 271,720 cohort participants, 381 died from PD during 19.7\u00a0years of follow-up. In single-pollutant analyses, we observed positive associations between PD mortality and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (hazard ratio per 5\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>: 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.55), NO<sub>2</sub> (1.13; 0.95-1.34 per 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), and BC (1.12; 0.94-1.34 per 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup>m<sup>-1</sup>), and a negative association with O<sub>3</sub> (0.74; 0.58-0.94 per 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>). Associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and BC with PD mortality were linear without apparent lower thresholds. In two-pollutant models, associations with PM<sub>2.5</sub> remained robust when adjusted for NO<sub>2</sub> (1.24; 0.95-1.62) or BC (1.28; 0.96-1.71), whereas associations with NO<sub>2</sub> or BC attenuated to null. O<sub>3</sub> associations remained negative, but no longer statistically significant in models with PM<sub>2.5</sub>.
