The comparison was made by assessing the three technologies with synthetic wastewaters polluted with different types of organic compounds and also with actual wastes (from olive oil mills and from a fine-chemical manufacturing plant). All three technologies were able to treat the wastes, but very different results were obtained in terms of efficiency and mineralization. Only CDEO could achieve complete mineralization of the pollutants for all the wastes. However, the efficiencies were found to depend on the concentration of pollutant (mass transfer control of the oxidation rate). Results obtained in the oxidation with ozone (at pH 12) or by Fenton's reagent were found to depend on the nature of the pollutants, and significant concentrations of oxidation-refractory compounds were usually accumulated during the treatment. Within the discharge limits that all of the technologies can reach, the economic analysis shows that the operating cost of Fenton oxidation is lower than either CDEO or ozonation, although CD\\EO can compete satisfactorily with the Fenton process in the treatment of several kinds of wastes. Likewise, the investment cost for the ozonation process seems to be higher than either CDEO or Fenton oxidation, regardless of the pollutant treated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Campus Universitario s/n, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ca\u00f1izares", "ForeName": "Pablo", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paz", "ForeName": "Rub\u00e9n", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1ez", "ForeName": "Cristina", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodrigo", "ForeName": "Manuel A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Manage", "NlmUniqueID": "0401664", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenton's reagent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18082930", "10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.10.010", "S0301-4797(07)00386-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
