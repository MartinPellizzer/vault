In this paper, long-term on-site monitoring of NAI concentration, air temperature, and relative humidity was conducted in real time over 24 h, from July 2019 to March 2021, to explore the temporal dynamic patterns of NAIs. We found that the daily dynamics of NAI concentration showed a bimodal curve. The peak concentrations usually occurred in the early morning (5:00-7:00) and afternoon (15:00-17:00), and the lowest concentrations usually occurred at noon (11:00-13:00). At the monthly scale, NAI concentrations were relatively high in February and August and low in May and December, and at the seasonal scale, NAI concentration was significantly higher in summer than in other seasons. Autumn had the second highest NAI concentration. There was no significant difference in NAI concentration between winter and spring. A comprehensive analysis shows that the AQI was the most key factor affecting NAI concentrations compared to temperature and relative humidity, especially the two indicators of particulate matter and ozone, and that NAI concentration had a negative correlation with these indicators and was significantly higher under favorable air quality conditions than under polluted air conditions. NAI concentrations and air temperature showed marked piecewise characteristics, with NAIs increasing linearly with rising temperature only if the Ta was separated into three ranges of -5 \u00b0C-10 \u00b0C, 10 \u00b0C-30 \u00b0C, and 30 \u00b0C-40 \u00b0C. With rising relative humidity, NAI concentration increased in accordance with a quadratic function. Our research provides new insights into the NAI temporal dynamics patterns and its driving factors, and will aid in scheduling outdoor recreation and forest health activities for urban people."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
