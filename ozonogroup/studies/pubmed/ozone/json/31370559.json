The method is designed to bridge the gap between multireference perturbation theory and single-reference second-order approximate coupled-cluster theory (CC2). By including semi-internal double excitations into the zeroth-order expansion, the new method is able to reliably describe the coupling between excitations within the active space and the entire single-excitation spectrum. This helps, for instance, to provide a balanced treatment of valence and ionic states in polyenes (as explicitly demonstrated for cyclopentadiene) and to arrive at a more complete coverage of the excitation spectrum without the need to include diffuse orbitals into the active space. Good performance is also seen for notoriously difficult molecules such as C<sub>2</sub> and CN. Furthermore, the multireference extension removes the main failures of single-reference CC2 theory, such as in the case of ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Theoretical Chemistry, University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 55, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": ["000000020844842X"], "LastName": "K\u00f6hn", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Theoretical Chemistry, University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 55, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000000225303433"], "LastName": "Bargholz", "ForeName": "Arne", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31370559", "10.1063/1.5115045"]}}]}
