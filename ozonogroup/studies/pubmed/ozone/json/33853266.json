Rubisco activity was significantly reduced only in plants grown in the presence of cadmium indicating that the photosynthetic process is mainly altered by this factor. Photochemical quenching and the quantum efficiency of PSII in steady-state conditions were significantly depressed and nonphotochemical quenching increased in stressed plants. Cd(II) and O<sub>3</sub> also strongly affected ascorbate metabolism. \u2022 \u2002The changes in ascorbate redox state and the increase in ascorbate-redox enzymes strongly supported an ascorbate over-utilization in Cd(II) and/or O<sub>3</sub> -treated plants. However, the increase in ascorbate-based detoxification mechanisms did not provide complete protection against the oxidative stress imposed by the two pollutants, since an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation accompanied a decrease in photosynthesis under pollutant exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scuola Superiore di Studi Universitari e di Perfezionamento 'S.
