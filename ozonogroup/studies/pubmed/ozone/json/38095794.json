The results showed that total VOCs concentrations were 547.1-1956.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and alkanes were the most abundant group in all processes (31.4%-54.6%), followed by alkenes (20.6%-29.2%) and aromatics (10.1%-25.1%). Moreover, ethylene (11.3%), iso-pentane (7.1%), n-hexane (5.1%), benzene (4.9%) and 2,2-dimethylbutae (4.8%) were identified as the top five species released for the whole petrochemical industry. The coefficient of divergence between the source profiles from different processes was 0.49-0.73, indicating that most source profiles must not be similar. Moreover, because of the different raw materials and technologies used, the source profiles in this study are significantly different from those of other regions. The ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation potentials (OFPs and SOAPs) were evaluated, suggesting that ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, m,p-xylene, and 1,3-butadiene should be preferentially controlled to reduce OFPs. That benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, isopropylbenzene, o-ethyltoluene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene should be priority control compounds for SOAPs. Additionally, the total hazard ratio for non-cancer risk ranged from 0.9 to 7.7, and only living area was unlikely to be related to adverse health effects. Cancer risks associated with organic chemicals, rubber synthesis, oil refining, and wastewater collection and treatment have definite risks, whereas other processes have probable risks. This study provides a scientific basis for VOCs emission control and management and guides human health in the petrochemical industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
