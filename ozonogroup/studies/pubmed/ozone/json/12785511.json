The exposure to components of air pollution in highway patrol vehicles, at an ambient, and a roadside location was determined during 25 work shifts (3 p.m. to midnight) in the autumn of 2001, each day with two cars. A global positioning system and a diary provided location and activity information. Average pollutant levels inside the cars were low compared to ambient air quality standards: carbon monoxide 2.7 ppm, nitrogen dioxide 41.7 microg/m3, ozone 11.7 ppb, particulate matter smaller 2.5 microm (PM2.5) 24 microg/m3. Volatile organic compounds inside the cars were in the ppb-range and showed the fingerprint of gasoline. PM2.5 was 24% lower than ambient and roadside levels, probably due to depositions associated with the recirculating air conditioning. Levels of carbon monoxide, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, and some metals (Al, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Sr) were highest in the cars, and roadside levels were higher than ambient levels. Elevated pollutant levels were related to locations with high traffic volumes. Our results point to combustion engine emissions from other vehicles as important sources of air pollutants inside the car."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.
