The experimental results showed that DMP degradation and mineralization increased by 26% and 20%, respectively, in catalytic ozonation compared with single ozonation, and more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and organic acids were produced during catalytic ozonation process than single ozonation. The effect of pH, ozone concentration and catalyst dosage on DMP degradation was determined. The addition of tert-butanol and phosphates showed a negative effect on DMP degradation, suggesting that the acidic sites on the catalyst is favorable to ozone decomposition to produce hydroxyl radicals. The possible mechanism for catalytic ozonation of DMP was tentatively proposed. The adsorption of ozone and organics onto the surface of catalyst could improve the DMP degradation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Water Resources and Environment , China University of Geosciences , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET , Tsinghua University , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Zhiyong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Water Resources and Environment , China University of Geosciences , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET , Tsinghua University , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Waste Treatment, INET , Tsinghua University , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianlong", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27748641", "10.1080/09593330.2016.1245360"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
