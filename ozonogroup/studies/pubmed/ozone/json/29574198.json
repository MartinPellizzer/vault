To evaluate its performance under more realistic conditions of water treatment, a continuous-flow pilot E-peroxone system was developed and compared with conventional ozonation and a UV/O<sub>3</sub> process for micropollutant abatements in various water matrices (groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent) in this study. With a specific ozone dose of 1.5\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC, micropollutants that have high and moderate reactivity with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) (diclofenac, naproxen, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate) could be sufficiently abated (>90% abatement) in the various waters by all three processes. However, ozone-resistant micropollutants (ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and chloramphenicol) were abated only by \u223c32-68%, 68-91%, and 73-90% during conventional ozonation of the selected groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. By electro-generating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or applying UV irradiation to enhance O<sub>3</sub> transformation to \u2022OH during ozonation, the E-peroxone and UV/O<sub>3</sub> processes similarly enhanced the abatement efficiencies of ozone-resistant micropollutants by \u223c15-43%, \u223c5-15%, and \u223c5-10% in the groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. In addition, the E-peroxone and UV/O<sub>3</sub> processes significantly reduced bromate formation during the treatment of the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. Due to its higher efficiency, the E-peroxone process reduced \u223c10-53% of the energy consumption required to abate the concentration of chloramphenicol (the most ozone-resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters) by 1 order of magnitude in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. In contrast, the UV/O<sub>3</sub> process consumed approximately 4-10 times higher energy than conventional ozonation. This pilot-scale study demonstrates that the E-peroxone process can provide a feasible, effective, and energy-efficient alternative for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in water and wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
