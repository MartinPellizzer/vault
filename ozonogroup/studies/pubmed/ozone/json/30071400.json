In this study, ten targeted perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), three targeted PFAA precursors, and non-targeted PFAA precursors were monitored in four full- and pilot-scale potable reuse plants at each stage of advanced treatment. Non-targeted PFAA precursors were quantified by applying a total oxidizable precursor assay in which PFAA precursors are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to targeted PFAAs. Two of the potable reuse systems had membrane-based treatments with reverse osmosis and UV-advanced oxidation (RO-UV/AOP) and two used ozone, biological activated carbon filtration and granular activated carbon adsorption (O<sub>3</sub>-BAC-GAC). The total targeted PFAAs in the four tertiary effluents, the influent sources for the potable reuse systems, ranged from 52 to 227\u202fng/L with non-targeted PFAA precursors accounting for 30-67% of total PFASs on a molar basis. The RO-UV/AOP treatment trains reduced PFAAs and PFAA precursors to below their method reporting limits through the barrier provided by RO. The O<sub>3</sub>-BAC-GAC based treatment trains reduced, but did not completely remove PFAAs or PFAA precursors and the PFASs present in the product water were primarily shorter-chain PFAAs, some of which lack human health guidance values for drinking water. The relative fraction of targeted shorter-chain PFAAs increased after each treatment step indicating that there was preferential removal of the PFAA precursors and longer-chain PFAAs. This study provides new insight on the concentrations and treatment of PFAA precursors through potable reuse treatment systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
