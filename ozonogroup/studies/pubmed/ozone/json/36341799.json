Histological examination of rats' brain in experimental revealed a pronounced increase in blood filling of small vessels on the tenth day of the experiment, with subsequent intensification of vascular alterations and eventually to cerebral edema. The exposure to noise significantly reduced total thymus, bone marrow and spleen cell numbers and these was also more pronounced under the joint impact of noise and toxic gases. Thymus, but not bone marrow or spleen, mitotic activity was as well reduced under the same modes of exposure. Cytological investigation of film preparations of subcutaneous connective tissue revealed that joint exposure led to microcirculatory disorders, increased number of dark mast cells and reduced degranulation processes indicative of increased autoregulatory processes effective at microvasculature level.", "High-frequency and intensity noise is main stressor factor that has negative impact on CNS and immune system, morphology and functioning of hematopoietic organs (spleen, bone marrow, thymus) and connective tissue. Its negative impact is significantly potentiated by concurrent exposure to ozone and nitrogen oxide, while exposure only to these toxic gases has no significant effect on the above targets."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
