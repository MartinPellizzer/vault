Previous research suggested that O<sub>3</sub> pollution can alter plant responses to drought by interfering with stomatal closure while drought can reduce stomatal conductance and provide protection against O<sub>3</sub> stress. However, the interactions between O<sub>3</sub> pollution and drought stress remain poorly understood at ecosystem scales with diverse plant functional types. To address this research gap, we used 10-year (2012-2021) satellite near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) observations, reanalysis data of vapor pressure deficit (VPD), soil moisture (SM), and air temperature (Ta), along with O<sub>3</sub> measurements and reanalysis data across the Northern Hemisphere to statistically disentangle the interconnections between NIRv, VPD, SM, and Ta under varying O<sub>3</sub> levels. We found that high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations significantly exacerbate the sensitivity of NIRv to VPD while have no notable impacts on the sensitivity of NIRv to Ta or SM for all plant functional types, indicating an enhanced combined impact of VPD and O<sub>3</sub> on plants. Specifically, the sensitivity of NIRv to VPD increased by >75\u00a0% when O<sub>3</sub> anomalies increased from the lowest 10 to the highest 10 percentiles across diverse plant functional types. This is likely because long-term exposure to high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations can inhibit stomatal closure and photosynthetic enzyme activities, resulting in reduced water use efficiency and photosynthetic efficiency. This study highlights the need to consider O<sub>3</sub> in understanding plant responses to climate factors and that O<sub>3</sub> can alter plant responses to VPD independently of Ta and SM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
