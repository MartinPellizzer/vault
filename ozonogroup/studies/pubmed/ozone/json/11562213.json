A key intermediate in our synthesis of 3a is the 7-oxonorbornene derivative 7a, which was derived from 4a utilizing a tandem Johnson ortho ester Claisen rearrangement followed by intramolecular Diels-Alder cyclization (five steps, 55-65%).(24) Interesting steric accelerating effects were observed in this sequence. Conversion of 7a to 3a was then accomplished employing a novel ozonide cleavage/oxidation reaction, which generated tetrahydrofurans 16a, 32, and 33 in the proper oxidation state for direct aminolysis to pyrrole 3a. A mechanism is proposed for the ozonide cleavage/oxidation that accounts for the observed stereoselectivity of this step."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Contribution from the Burke Chemical Laboratory, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacobi", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM38913", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "74KHC72QXK", "NameOfSubstance": "Porphobilinogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Porphobilinogen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11562213", "10.1021/ja016303q", "ja016303q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
