Plants exposed to O<sub>3</sub> showed visible injury and an alteration of membrane integrity, as confirmed by the malondialdehyde by-product accumulation (+3 and +17% under 1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202fAA and 2.0\u202f\u00d7\u202fAA conditions, in comparison to AA). This was probably due to O<sub>3</sub>-induced oxidative damage, as documented by the production of superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, +27 and +63%, respectively). Ozone per se, independently from the concentrations, induced multiple signals (e.g., alteration of cellular redox state, increase of abscisic acid/indole-3-acetic acid ratio and reduction of proline content) that might be part of premature leaf senescence processes. By contrast, nutrient fertilization (both N and P) reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation (as confirmed by the decreased O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and hydrogen peroxide content), resulting in enhanced membrane stability. This was probably due to the simultaneous involvement of antioxidant compounds (e.g., carotenoids, ascorbate and glutathione) and osmoprotectants (e.g., proline) that regulate the detoxification processes of coping with oxidative stress by reducing the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity of Oxford clone. These mitigation effects were effective only under AA and 1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202fAA conditions. Nitrogen and P supply activated a free radical scavenging system that was not able to delay leaf senescence and mitigate the adverse effects of a general peroxidation due to the highest O<sub>3</sub> concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
