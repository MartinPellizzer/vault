'Moapa') exposed to simulated fogs of pH 7.24, 2.69 and 1.68 singly, and in combination with ambient ozone (O3) over an 11-week period. Highly acidic fog (pH 1.68) or ambient O3 significantly reduced totalseason dry yield and foliar pigment concentrations, and increased leaf drop. Significant interactive effects between acidic fog and O3 were observed for the leaf parameters, but not for yield. Thus, multiple exposures to acidic fog at current ambient levels of acidity (i.e. pH 2.69) could effect leaf quality in the absence of significant effects on yield. Alternatively, O3-induced effects on leaves may have utility as bioindicators of potential yield losses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hutton", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olszyk", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092527", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90140-6", "0269749188901406"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
