The data were compared with acute, chronic, and human health air and water quality standards to determine whether the pollutant levels occurring during the oil spill could cause ecological and/or human health effects. The water quality data indicated levels of nickel, vanadium, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and semivolatile organic compounds analyzed remained below acute and chronic levels for both aquatic life and human health. The air quality sampling data showed that the levels of VOCs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons associated with the oil spill were well below EPA chronic and human health screening levels. A comparison of the air quality monitoring data taken before and after the oil spill showed that the concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter were elevated for brief periods but remained below actionable levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS, USA. jbeasley@deq.state.ms.us"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beasley", "ForeName": "Jerry", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "Ramata S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tchounwou", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kafoury", "ForeName": "Ramzi", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Rev Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0425754", "ISSNLinking": "0048-7554"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gulf of Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mississippi"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23109537", "10.1515/reveh-2012-0006", "/j/reveh.2012.27.issue-2-3/reveh-2012-0006/reveh-2012-0006.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
