Many analytical techniques have been developed to detect NO(2), but only chemiluminescence-based instruments are commonly, commercially available. There remains a need for a fast, light, and simple method to directly measure NO(2). In this work we describe the modification and characterization of a small, commercially available cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) NO(2) detector suitable for surface and aircraft monitoring. A metal oxide scrubber was added to remove NO(2), and provide a chemical zero, improving the detection limit (3sigma of the background noise) from several parts per billion by volume (ppbv) to 0.06 ppbv, integrated over 60 s. Known interferences by water and particles were removed using Nafion tubing and a 1 microm Teflon filter, respectively. A 95% response time of 18+/-1 s was observed for a step change in concentration. The CRDS detector was run in parallel to an ozone chemiluminescence device with photolytic conversion of NO(2) to NO. The two instruments measured ambient air in suburban Maryland. A least-squares fit to the comparison data resulted a slope of 0.960+/-0.002 and R of 0.995, showing agreement within experimental uncertainty."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA. patti@umd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castellanos", "ForeName": "Patricia", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luke", "ForeName": "Winston T", "Initials": "WT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelley", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stehr", "ForeName": "Jeffrey W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ehrman", "ForeName": "Sheryl H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dickerson", "ForeName": "Russell R", "Initials": "RR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Rev Sci Instrum", "NlmUniqueID": "0405571", "ISSNLinking": "0034-6748"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artifacts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19947717", "10.1063/1.3244090"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
