A field exclusion chamber study was established at Whitetop Mountain, VA (elevation 1689 m) which included the following treatments: (1) clouds and O3 excluded (COE); (2) exposure to ambient O3 with clouds excluded (CE); (3) exposure to clouds and O3 (CC); and (4) ambient air plots (AA) that served as a control to evaluate possible chamber effects. After 2 years, seedlings exposed to ambient levels of O3 and cloudwater (AA and CC) did not differ in biomass accumulation, diameter growth, or epicuticular wax amounts from seedlings grown in chambers where pollution levels were reduced (CE and COE). Treatments receiving cloudwater (AA and CC) had statistically lower current-year needle concentrations of Ca and Mg, indicating that the cloudwater exposure dynamics occurring at this site elicited reductions in needle Ca and Mg. Ozone had negligible impact on all of the seedling parameters measured."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Science Department, Tennessee Valley Authority, Chemical Engineering Bldg., Room 2W 210-A, Muscle Shoals, AL 35660, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thornton", "ForeName": "F C", "Initials": "FC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDuffie", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pier", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkinson", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091909", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90173-l", "026974919390173L"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
