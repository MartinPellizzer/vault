In addition to grain yield, average grain mass and harvest index were included to reflect the influence of ozone on the crop growth pattern. In order to include as many experiments as possible, daytime average ozone concentration was used as the ozone exposure index, but AOT40, estimated from average ozone concentrations, was also used to compare the performance of the two exposure metrics. The response to ozone differed significantly between the continents only for grain yield when using AOT40 as the exposure index. North American wheat was less sensitive than European and Asian that responded similarly. The variation in responses across all three continents was smallest for harvest index, followed by grain mass and grain yield. The highly consistent effect on harvest index shows that not only effects on biomass accumulation, but also on the partitioning of biomass, are important for the ozone-induced grain yield loss in wheat. The average duration of daily ozone exposure was longer in European experiments compared to North American and Asian. It cannot be excluded that this contributed to the indicated higher ozone sensitivity in European wheat in relation to North American. The main conclusions from this study are that on the average the response of wheat to ozone was lower for the older North American experiments and that the ozone response of the growth pattern reflected by grain mass and harvest index did not differ between continents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
