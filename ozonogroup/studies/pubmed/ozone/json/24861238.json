Average O3 concentrations were higher at locations around Beijing than in the city center. Levels varied with site locations and ranged from 22.5 to 48.1\u00a0ppb and were highest at three locations. Hourly O3 concentrations exceeded 40\u00a0ppb for 128\u00a0h and 80\u00a0ppb for 17\u00a0h from 2 to 9 in August at one site, where it had a real-time O3 analyzer. Extensive foliar O3 injury was found on 19 species of native and cultivated trees, shrubs, and herbs at 6 of the 10 study sites and the other 2 sites without passive sampler. This is the first report of O3 foliar injury in and around Beijing. Our results warrant an extensive program of O3 monitoring and foliar O3 injury assessment in and around Beijing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
