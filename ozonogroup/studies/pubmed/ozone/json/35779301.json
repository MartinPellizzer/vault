They have been found in environmental matrices all around the world, showing that conventional treatment methods fail to remove them from water and wastewater. In addition, the metabolites and transformation products of these drugs can be more persistent than original in the environment. Several techniques to degrade/remove antiviral drugs against influenza have been investigated to prevent this contamination. In this study, the characteristics of antiviral drugs against influenza, their measurement by analytical methods, and their removal in both water and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were presented. Different treatment methods, such as traditional procedures (biological processes, filtration, coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation), advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), adsorption and combined methods, were assessed. Ecotoxicological effects of both the antiviral drug and its metabolites as well as the transformation products formed as a result of treatment were evaluated. In addition, future perspectives for improving the removal of antiviral drugs against influenza, their metabolites and transformation products were further discussed. The research indicated that the main tested techniques in this study were ozonation, photolysis and photocatalysis. Combined methods, particularly those that use renewable energy and waste materials, appear to be the optimum approach for the treatment of effluents containing antiviral drugs against influenza. In light of high concentrations or probable antiviral resistance, this comprehensive assessment suggests that antiviral drug monitoring is required, and some of those substances may cause toxicological effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
