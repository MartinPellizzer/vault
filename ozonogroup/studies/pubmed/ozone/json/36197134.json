Previous literature experimental work revealed a small yield of nitric acid (HONO<sub>2</sub>) directly from HO<sub>2</sub> + NO. Atmospheric models previously treated HO<sub>2</sub> + NO as radical recycling, but inclusion of this terminating step had large effects on atmospheric oxidative capacity and the concentrations of HONO<sub>2</sub> and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), among others. Here, the yield of HONO<sub>2</sub>, \u03c6<sub>HONO<sub>2</sub></sub>, from the reaction of HO<sub>2</sub> + NO was investigated in a flow tube reactor using mid-IR pulsed-cavity ringdown spectroscopy. HO<sub>2</sub>, produced by pulsed laser photolysis of Cl<sub>2</sub> in the presence of methanol, reacted with NO in a buffer gas mixture of N<sub>2</sub> and CO between 300 and 700 Torr at 278 and 300 K. HONO<sub>2</sub> and its weakly bound isomer HOONO were directly detected by their <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> absorption bands in the mid-IR region. CO was used to suppress HONO<sub>2</sub> produced from OH + NO<sub>2</sub> and exploit a chemical amplification scheme, converting OH back to HO<sub>2</sub>. Under the experimental conditions described here, no evidence for the formation of either HONO<sub>2</sub> or HOONO was observed from HO<sub>2</sub> + NO. Using a comprehensive chemical model, constrained by observed secondary reaction products, all HONO<sub>2</sub> detected in the system could be accounted for by OH + NO<sub>2</sub>. At 700 \u00b1 14 Torr and 300 \u00b1 3 K, \u03c6<sub>HONO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 0.00 \u00b1 0.11% (2\u03c3) with an upper limit of 0.11%. If all of the observed HONO<sub>2</sub> was attributed to the HO<sub>2</sub> + NO reaction, \u03c6<sub>HONO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 0.13 \u00b1 0.07% with an upper limit of 0.20%. At 278 \u00b1 2 K and 718 \u00b1 14 Torr, we determine an upper limit, \u03c6<sub>HONO<sub>2</sub></sub> \u2264 0.37%. Our measurements are significantly lower than those previously reported, lying outside of the uncertainty of the current experimental and recommended literature values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4166-3954"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arthur Amos Noyes Laboratory of Chemical Physics, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California91125, United States."}], "LastName": "Mertens", "ForeName": "Laura A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2801-5581"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California91109, United States."}], "LastName": "Winiberg", "ForeName": "Frank A F", "Initials": "FAF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arthur Amos Noyes Laboratory of Chemical Physics, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California91125, United States."}], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Hannah M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1424-3620"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California91109, United States."}], "LastName": "Sander", "ForeName": "Stanley P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6874-1137"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arthur Amos Noyes Laboratory of Chemical Physics, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, California91125, United States."}], "LastName": "Okumura", "ForeName": "Mitchio", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36197134", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c04643"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
