The alveolar macrophages were isolated from animals sacrificed 28 h after the end of the exposure. The mitotic index and frequency of chromosome aberrations were determined. No change in the mitotic index was detected following 0.12 ppm ozone exposure. A significant decrease in mitotic index was observed after exposure to 0.27 ppm ozone; a significant (4-fold) increase in the frequency of dividing macrophages was detected following exposure to 0.8 ppm ozone. Only chromatid-type aberrations were observed. There was a significant increase in the frequency of cells with chromatid gaps and in the frequency of cells with chromatid deletions. Animals exposed to 0.27 ppm ozone had the highest proportion of cells with chromatid deletions (0.172) relative to background level (0.028). No exchanges or chromosome-type aberrations were detected in any of the animals. These data suggest that ozone, at relatively low levels, is clastogenic in macrophages from exposed rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, MN 87185."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rithidech", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hotchkiss", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Griffith", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brooks", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES04282", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2333085", "10.1016/0165-1218(90)90109-f", "0165-1218(90)90109-F"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
