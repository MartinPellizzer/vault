The rats were exposed to welding fumes with concentrations of 57-67 mg/m3 (low dose) and 105-118 mg/m3 (high dose) total suspended particulates for 2 h per day in an inhalation chamber for 90 days. The concentrations of the main metals, Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ni, were measured in the welding fumes, plus the gaseous compounds, including nitrous gases and ozone, were monitored. During the exposure period, the animals were sacrificed after the initial 2-h exposure and after 15, 30, 60, and 90 days. Histopathological examinations were conducted on the animals' upper respiratory tract, including the nasal pathway and conducting airway, plus the gas exchange region, including the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. When compared to the control group, the lung weights did not increase significantly in the low-dose group, yet in the high-dose group there was a significant increase from day 15 to day 90. The histopathological examination combined with fibrosis-specific staining (Masson's trichrome) indicated that the lungs in the low-dose group did not exhibit any progressive fibrotic changes. Whereas, the lungs in the high-dose group exhibited early delicate fibrosis from day 15, which progressed into the perivascular and peribronchiolar regions by day 30. Interstitial fibrosis appeared at day 60 and became prominent by day 90, along with the additional appearance of pleural fibrosis. Accordingly, it would appear that a significant dose of welding-fume exposure was required to induce lung fibrosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Occupational Toxicology, Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, 104-8 Moonji-dong, Yusung-gu, Taejon, 305-380, Korea. u1670916@chollian.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "I J", "Initials": "IJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeng", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12597-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Stainless Steel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stainless Steel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11509749", "10.1093/toxsci/63.1.99"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
