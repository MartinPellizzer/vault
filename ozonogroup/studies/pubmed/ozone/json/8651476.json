Some in vitro actions of nedocromil sodium are particularly relevant to the mechanisms of allergic rhinitis, and the response of the nasal epithelium to pollutants such as ozone. The effects of nedocromil sodium on mucosal mast cells, eosinophils, sensory nerves and nasal epithelial cells can each be linked to its potential clinical effectiveness by our own biopsy studies from patients with active allergic rhinitis. Nedocromil sodium has been shown to modulate production of a number of powerful cytokines, such as GM-CSF and TNF alpha, which are produced by the human nasal epithelium, as well as by involved inflammatory cells and lymphocytes, and which orchestrate the inflammatory response to allergen or to pollutant provocation. So, in addition to inhibiting activated mast cells and eosinophils, nedocromil sodium acts on the nasal epithelium itself to prevent further accumulation of these cells and thus to break the inflammatory chain of events. On this evidence of its preclinical activity, nedocromil sodium promises to become a very useful topical treatment for allergic rhinitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "St. Bartholomews Hospital, London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "7804028", "ISSNLinking": "0105-4538"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0B535E0BN0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nedocromil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nedocromil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "26"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8651476", "10.1111/j.1398-9995.1996.tb04773.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
