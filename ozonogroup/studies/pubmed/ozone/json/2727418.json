In 0.8 ppm O3, rapid-shallow breathing began at 60 min exposure while VE and MO2 declined beginning at 40 min. In comparison to clean air exposed animals, rats (n = 8) during the third hour of 0.8 ppm O3 exposure had a 27% increase in frequency, 35% decline in tidal volume, 20% decrease in VE, 24% decrease in MO2, and 1.3 degrees C decrease in TR. At lower O3 concentrations, responses were diminished in magnitude, and in rats exposed to 0.2 ppm O3, only MO2 was significantly decreased, irritant-induced depression of VE did not imply a state of hypoventilation or hypoxia because ventilation equivalent for O2 (VE/MO2) did not decline during O3 exposures. Body temperature and metabolic rate depression have not been observed during the development of rapid-shallow breathing in dogs or humans exposed to these low levels of O3, and the present observations in rats may reflect a more labile thermoregulatory physiology among rodents. Ventilatory and metabolic rate depression in response to irritant inhalation can be an effective pulmonary defense in rodents and other heterothermic mammals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community and Environmental Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92717."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mautz", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bufalino", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Respir Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0047142", "ISSNLinking": "0034-5687"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmolar Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2727418", "10.1016/0034-5687(89)90018-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
