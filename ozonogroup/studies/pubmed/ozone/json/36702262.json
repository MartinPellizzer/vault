An accurate depiction of the emission characteristics of VOCs is the key to formulating VOC control strategies. In this study, the VOC emission factors and source profiles in five industrial sectors were developed using large-scale field measurements conducted in Guangzhou, China (100 samples for the emission factors and 434 samples for the source profile measurements). The emission factors based on the actual measurement method and the material balance method were 1.6-152.4 kg of VOCs per ton of raw materials (kg/t) and 3.1-242.2 kg/t, respectively. The similarities between the emission factors obtained using these two methods were examined, which showed a coefficient of divergence (CD) of 0.34-0.72. Among the 33 subdivided VOC source profiles developed in this study, sources including light guide plate (LGP), photoresist mask, and plastic products were the first time developed in China. Due to regional diversities in terms of production technologies, materials, and products, the emission characteristics of the VOCs varied, even in the same sector, thereby demonstrating the importance of developing localized source profiles of VOCs. The ozone formation potential (OFP) of the shipbuilding and repair sector from fugitive emissions was the highest value among all the industrial sectors. Controlling the emissions of aromatics and OVOCs was critical to reducing the O<sub>3</sub> growth momentum in industrial sectors. In addition, 1,2-dibromoethane showed high carcinogenic risk potentials (CRPs) during most of the industrial sectors and should be prioritized for controlling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
