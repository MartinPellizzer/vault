O(3) concentrations were measured from May-September for three years (1993-1995) while CO(2) concentrations were measured only during July and August of 1994. O(3) concentrations increased steadily during the day at all locations, peaking during the middle to late afternoon hours. O(3) concentrations then steadily declined to their lowest point, just before dawn. Vertical O(3) concentration gradients varied seasonally and among years. However, O(3) concentrations were highest within the forest canopy and lowest at the forest floor, with an average difference of approximately 13%. Differences in O(3) concentrations between the canopy and forest floor were greatest at night. O(3) concentrations were slightly higher at locations within the canopy than above the canopy. CO(2) concentrations were consistenly higher near the forest floor and were higher above the canopy than within the canopy. CO(2) concentrations were higher at night than during the day at all locations, especially near the forest floor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Pennsylvania State University, 108 Buckhout Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fredericksen", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savage", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Snyder", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093510", "10.1016/s0269-7491(96)00108-x", "S0269-7491(96)00108-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
