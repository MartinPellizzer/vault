The aim of this study was two-fold: to investigate whether O3 formation in this population exposure-type site is NOx, sensitive or volatile organic compound (VOC) sensitive and to test the practicality of using two combined observational-based methods to identify the sensitivity of O3 formation in midlevel polluted locations. The evaluation of the indicator species: NOy, O3/NOy, O3/HNO3, H2O2/ HNO3, and O3/(estimated NOx reaction products), as well as the combined hypothesis testing analysis of the weekend/weekday (WE/WD) differences of 1-hr and 8-hr average maximum O3 and of the 6:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m. average nitric oxide and NOx concentrations, show evidence that Cincinnati is likely VOC sensitive. Average WE 1-hr and 8-hr maximum O3, as well as duration of WE O3 accumulation, were not lower than the corresponding WD levels in spite of the observed significant reduction in NO, emissions on WE, a typical situation in VOC-sensitive locations. The possibility that the seasonal transition from summer to autumn could have influenced the results was also investigated through an exploratory analysis of the afternoon O3 maximum/NOx measured and of the WE/WD differences of peak O3 and morning average NO and NO, concentrations observed at this site from June through September 2003. The results suggest that a VOC-sensitive chemistry regime dominated along the summer season. The findings of this study suggest that additional reductions in regional NO, emissions in Cincinnati, a potential nonattainment area under the 8-hr O3 standard, may cause an increase in local O3. Future strategies to reduce O3 in Southwest Ohio should be further evaluated carefully. The combination of observational-based methods might provide a consistent complementary approach in the identification of the NO,-VOC sensitive characteristics of mid-to-moderate polluted urban areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Atmospheric Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torres-Jard\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Ricardo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keener", "ForeName": "Tim C", "Initials": "TC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "411VRN1TV4", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ohio"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16573195", "10.1080/10473289.2006.10464459"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
