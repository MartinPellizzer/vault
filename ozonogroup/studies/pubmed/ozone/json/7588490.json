Thirty healthy subjects and 30 allergic asthmatic subjects underwent 3-hr exposures in an environmental chamber to 100 micrograms/m3 sulfuric acid and sodium chloride (control) aerosols (in random order), followed 24 hr later by 3-hr exposures to ozone (0.08, 0.12, or 0.18 ppm). Each subject was studied four times, receiving each aerosol preexposure followed by two of the three ozone concentrations. For the healthy group, no convincing symptomatic or physiologic effects of exposure to either the aerosol or ozone on lung function were found. For the asthmatic group, preexposure to sulfuric acid altered the pattern of response to ozone in comparison with sodium chloride preexposure and appeared to enhance the small mean decrements in FVC that occurred in response to 0.18 ppm ozone (means +/- SE: -3.6 +/- 1.5% with sodium chloride preexposure, -6.8 +/- 1.7% with sulfuric acid preexposure). Individual responses among asthmatic subjects were quite variable, some demonstrating reductions in FEV1 of more than 35% following ozone exposure. Analysis of variance of changes in FVC revealed evidence for interactions between aerosol and ozone exposure both immediately after (P = 0.005) and 4 hr after (P = 0.030) exposure. Similar effects were seen for FEV1. When normal and asthmatic subjects were combined, four-way analysis of variance revealed an interaction between ozone and aerosol for the entire group (P = 0.0022) and a difference between normal and asthmatic subjects (P = 0.0048). There was no significant effect of exposures on symptoms for either normal or asthmatic subjects. Asthmatic subjects differ from healthy volunteers in their functional responses following sequential exposures to aerosols and ozone and appear to represent a susceptible population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York 14642, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frampton", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morrow", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Levy", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Condemi", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Speers", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gibb", "ForeName": "F R", "Initials": "FR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Utell", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01ES02679", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01HL51701", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RR00044", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O40UQP6WCF", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7588490", "10.1006/enrs.1995.1020", "S0013-9351(85)71020-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
