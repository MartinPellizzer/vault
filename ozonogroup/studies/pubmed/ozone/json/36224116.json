Faced with this problem, this study proposed a method of regionalizing synergetic prevention and control areas based on multi-source remote sensing data and GIS spatial statistical analysis methods and carried out quantitative analyses of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> air pollution in China from 2015 to 2020. The results showed that there was an obvious decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, and O<sub>3</sub>concentrations remained stable; PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution mostly occurred in autumn and winter, and O<sub>3</sub> pollution occurred in spring and summer. A significant spatial inconsistency was shown between the change rate of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, in which the proportions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreasing and O<sub>3</sub> increasing, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> both decreasing, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> both increasing, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> increasing and O<sub>3</sub> decreasing accounted for 38.34%, 35.12%, 15.24%, and 10.89%, respectively. The results also showed that the boundary of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> synergetic prevention and control areas was dynamic during 2015 and 2020, showing a trend of expanding from 2015 to 2018 and then becoming smaller after 2019. Generally, the scope of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> synergetic prevention and control areas was concentrated in \"2+26\" cities, Fenwei plain, north of the Yangtze River Delta, and Shandong. In contrast, the regional scopes of \"PM<sub>2.5</sub> first\" and \"O<sub>3</sub> first\" were relatively stable. Areas of \"PM<sub>2.5</sub> first\" were mainly carried out in Liaoning-Jilin, Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Taklimakan-Hexi Corridor, whereas \"O<sub>3</sub> first\" areas were mainly in specific regions of the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and surrounding areas of Bohai Bay. Remote sensing-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> mapping has the advantages of full-coverage and fine spatial simulation, which can support the regionalization of synergetic prevention and control areas and implementation of policies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geosciences and Info-physics, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shen-Xin", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geosciences and Info-physics, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Centre, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng-Ying", "Initials": "FY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geosciences and Info-physics, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geosciences and Info-physics, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Chen-Hao", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geosciences and Info-physics, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Remote Sensing Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36224116", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202112075"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
