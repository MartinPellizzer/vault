This treatment takes place in the classical milling sequence, after the grain-cleaning step and before milling. The Oxygreen process could also be used for its properties in wheat grain decontamination (insects, fungi, bacteria, mycotoxins, storage insecticides residues). The aim of this study was to determine if Oxygreen treatment could induce in the grain the formation of processing-related substances, able to provoke adverse effects, after ingestion of the wheat and/or derived products, and to establish the safety of the Oxygreen process for animals and consumers. A four-week toxicity study, according to OECD guideline No. 407, was performed on Dark agouti rats fed exclusively with wheat grains, treated or untreated with Oxygreen. Clinical, haematological, blood biochemical, urinary and histopathological parameters were investigated during the study. The few modifications observed in animals given treated wheat were an increase of rectal temperature in females, a slight decrease of calcium concentration in males and slight decrease of certain blood cell number without clinical significances. This work shows that wheat treated by Oxygreen does not induce adverse effects in Dark agouti rats after oral administration. Therefore wheat and derived products from wheat, after Oxygreen treatment on grain, could be considered as safe for the consumer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIT, Evreux Cedex, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gaou", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dubois", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfohl-Leszkowicz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coste", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Jouffrey", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parent-Massin", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam", "NlmUniqueID": "8500474", "ISSNLinking": "0265-203X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16332634", "10.1080/02652030500307156", "R054216082072700"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
