We tested the possibility that many effects of L-arginine are mediated by increased formation of NO and enhanced nitrite, nitrate and nitrosylated species concentrations, thus stimulating the enterosalivary cycle of nitrate. Those effects could be prevented by antiseptic mouthwash. We examined how the derangement of the enterosalivary cycle of nitrate affects the improvement of endothelial dysfunction (assessed with isolated aortic ring preparation), the antihypertensive (assessed by tail-cuff blood pressure measurement) and the antioxidant effects (assessed with the fluorescent dye DHE) of L-arginine in two-kidney, one-clip hypertension model in rats by using chlorhexidine to decrease the number of oral bacteria and to decrease nitrate reductase activity assessed from the tongue (by ozone-based chemiluminiscence assay). Nitrite, nitrate and nitrosylated species concentrations were assessed (ozone-based chemiluminiscence). Chlorhexidine mouthwash reduced the number of oral bacteria and tended to decrease the nitrate reductase activity from the tongue. Antiseptic mouthwash blunted the improvement of the endothelial dysfunction and the antihypertensive effects of L-arginine, impaired L-arginine-induced increases in plasma nitrite and nitrosylated species concentrations, and blunted L-arginine-induced increases in aortic nitrate concentrations and vascular antioxidant effects. Our results show for the first time that the vascular and antihypertensive effects of L-arginine are prevented by antiseptic mouthwash. These findings show an important new mechanism that should be taken into consideration to explain how the use of antibacterial mouth rinse may affect arterial blood pressure and the risk of developing cardiovascular and other diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
