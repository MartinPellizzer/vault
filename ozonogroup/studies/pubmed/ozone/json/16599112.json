The results show that the frequency of O3 hourly concentrations more than the first-degree of National Ambient Air Quality Standard(GB-3095-1996, NAAQS) was 15.81%, and the frequency of CO concentrations more than the first-degree of NAAQS was zero. The variation of O3 concentrations appears in a narrow scope, which indicates that there is scarcely influenced by the pollution of industry around. The diurnal variation of the concentrations of O3 and that of CO both present two peaks with the peaks of O3 in the behind of CO, which indicates that the concentration variations of O3 and its precursor CO are primarily controlled by local photochemical reaction process. The daily concentrations of O3 correlated well with CO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yong-Quan", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Wen-Po", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chang-Mei", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Zhao-Jie", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16599112"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
