The ozone exposure of a plant is usually expressed in terms of the concentration above the canopy or as a time-weighted index. However, to understand the physiological effects of ozone it is necessary to quantify the ozone flux to individual leaves as they develop, which requires knowing the deposition velocity and concentration of the pollutant as a function of height throughout the plant canopy. We used a high-order closure model of sub-canopy turbulence to estimate ozone profiles in stands of cutleaf coneflower (Rudbeckia laciniata L.) located in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. The model was run for periods coinciding with a short field study, during which we measured vertical concentration profiles of ozone along with measurements of atmospheric turbulence and other meteorological and plant variables. Predictions of ozone profiles by the model are compared with observations throughout the canopy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Modeling Division, NOAA, USA. finkelstein.peter@epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finkelstein", "ForeName": "Peter L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davison", "ForeName": "Alan W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neufeld", "ForeName": "Howard S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meyers", "ForeName": "Tilden P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chappelka", "ForeName": "Arthur H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rudbeckia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15234096", "10.1016/j.envpol.2004.02.029", "S0269749104000715"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
