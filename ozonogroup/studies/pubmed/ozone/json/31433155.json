Chronic exposure to VOC vapor can be potentially dangerous to human health. In this study, we build a high-performance freestanding aligned Ag/CdSe-CdS/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) texture to detect VOC vapors. The insight of this new VOC-sensing material is based on electrospinning techniques, ultraviolet (UV)/ozone treatments, and nano-optics. The incorporation of CdSe-CdS core-shell quantum rods (QR) and silver nanocrystals in the PMMA nanofibers amplifies the polarization response of long rods in VOC detection, thus increasing the sensitivity of VOC-sensing materials. Further, the uniaxial aligned Ag/QR/PMMA sensing material was treated by UV-ozone etching to increase surface absorption. The advanced double-sided UV-ozone etching on the uniaxial aligned Ag/QR/PMMA efficiently enhanced the extinction changes of VOCs. Two categories of solvents, typical VOCs and alcoholic VOCs, were put into practical tests for the Ag/QR/PMMA VOC-sensing materials. The Ag/QR/PMMA reached the detection limit for 100 ppm butanol within 1 min. The freestanding aligned Ag/CdSe-CdS/PMMA texture is a newly designed nanocomposite device for environmental risk monitoring. It can be accepted by the market compared to the other highly sensitive commercial VOC-sensing materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3584-3871"], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ming-Chung", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chi-Hung", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ting-Han", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Shun-Hsiang", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yin-Hsuan", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fiber and Composite Materials , Feng Chia University , Taichung 40724 , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Tz-Feng", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering , Southern University of Science and Technology , Shenzhen 518055 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ziming", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering , Southern University of Science and Technology , Shenzhen 518055 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0443-6955"], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Engineering , Ming Chi University of Technology , New Taipei City 24301 , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2069-7533"], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Chao-Sung", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31433155", "10.1021/acsami.9b12333"]}}]}
