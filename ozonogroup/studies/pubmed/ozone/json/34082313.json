However, the total rate coefficients of styrene\u00a0+\u00a0OH were measured as 1.2-6.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-11</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> under atmospheric conditions, varying by a maximum factor of 5. On the other hand, only one theoretical work reported this rate coefficient as 19.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-11</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, which exhibits up to 16 times that measured in laboratory studies. In the present study, the reaction kinetics of styrene\u00a0+\u00a0OH was extensively studied with high-level quantum chemical methods combined with RRKM/master equation simulations. In particular, we carried out theoretical treatments for the formation of pre-reaction Van der Waals complexes of styrene\u00a0+\u00a0OH, and examined their influence on the reaction kinetics. The total rate coefficient for styrene\u00a0+\u00a0OH is calculated to be 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-11</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 300\u00a0K, 1\u00a0atm. The main products are add\u03b2 (88.2%), add5 (6.9%), add\u03b1 (1.9%) and add3 (1.7%). Using our computed rate coefficient and the global atmospheric hydroxyl radical concentration (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> radicals per cm<sup>3</sup>), the lifetime of styrene in the atmosphere is estimated at 8.0\u00a0h. The degradation of styrene might be negligible for the formation of ozone in the atmosphere based upon the photochemical ozone creation potentials calculation. The computed product yields indicate that add\u03b2 via subsequent reactions could significantly produce formaldehyde and benzaldehyde that were observed in previous experimental studies on styrene oxidation, and contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosols."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
