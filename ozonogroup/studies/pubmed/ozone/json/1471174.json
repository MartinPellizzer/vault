Organic solvents are commonly used as mixtures rather than individual solvents, except for the case of degreasers. Nevertheless, toxicity of mixtures remain mostly to be studied. Among the solvents in general, toluene is apparently the most popular. Narcotic effects are common with all solvents (independent of chemical structure) at high concentrations, and result in an increased incidence of various CNS-related subjective symptoms at concentrations in excess of current occupational exposure limits. Chronic toxicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity seems to be related to a given chemical structure. Among the recently reported effects are blindness of \"sniffers\" by methanol inhalation and teratogenicity of ethylene glycol derivatives in experimental animals. In environmental health, pollution of ground water as well as the general atmosphere by chlorinated hydrocarbons has provoked serious public concern. In addition, emission of certain chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons is recognized to deplete ozone in stratosphere, which may result in human health effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikeda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Blindness"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}], "NumberOfReferences": "36"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1471174", "10.1016/0378-4274(92)90189-q", "0378-4274(92)90189-Q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
