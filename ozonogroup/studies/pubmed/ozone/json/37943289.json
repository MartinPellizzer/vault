The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of ozone therapy combined with sodium fluoride in reducing pain associated with dental hypersensitivity, compared to a paint-on adhesive desensitizing agent.", "The study included 20 patients (131 teeth), selected according to specific inclusion criteria and divided into two groups according to the type of desensitizing therapy (ozone with sodium fluoride or paint-on adhesive). The efficacy of both treatments were evaluated recording pain for each treated tooth immediately after treatment, after 1 month and after 6 months using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Subjective parameters were also recorded: patients were asked to report whether they experienced pain caused by air, teeth brushing, cold and hot topical stimuli (present/absent).", "In both groups, pain values significantly decreased over time. Six months after treatment we registered significantly lower pain values in the ozone-treated group compared with the adhesive group and the mean percentage of NRS reduction from was significantly higher in the ozone-treated group. We did not register significant differences in subjective pain-related parameters between groups.", "The results of this exploratory study were aimed at exploring the combined effect of ozone with natrium fluoride, which was before described only in vitro. With the limitation of the sample size, our results suggest that this approach provides a pain reduction that was comparable to the paint-on adhesive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy - krupel@units.it."}], "LastName": "Rupel", "ForeName": "Katia", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ottaviani", "ForeName": "Giulia", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy."}], "LastName": "Bogdan Preda", "ForeName": "Magdalena T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy."}], "LastName": "Poropat", "ForeName": "Augusto", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Ca' Foncello Hospital, Treviso, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gobbo", "ForeName": "Margherita", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy."}], "LastName": "DI Lenarda", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy."}], "LastName": "Biasotto", "ForeName": "Matteo", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Minerva Dent Oral Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101778009", "ISSNLinking": "2724-6329"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8ZYQ1474W7", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Fluoride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q80VPU408O", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Fluoride"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin Sensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37943289", "10.23736/S2724-6329.23.04830-1", "S2724-6329.23.04830-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
