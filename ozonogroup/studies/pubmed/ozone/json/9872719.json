However, much of the evidence involves effects on the elderly population; there is less evidence about the effects of particulates on children, especially those under 2 years of age. To examine these issues, we conducted time-series analyses of 2 years of daily visits to primary health care clinics in Santiago, Chile, where counts were computed for either upper or lower respiratory symptoms and for cohorts of children 3-15 years of age and below age 2. Daily PM10 and ozone measurements and meteorological variables were available from instruments located in downtown Santiago. The multiple regression analysis indicates a statistically significant association between PM10 and medical visits for lower respiratory symptoms in children ages 3-15 and in children under age 2. PM10 is also associated with medical visits related to upper respiratory symptoms in the older cohort, while ozone is associated with visits related to both lower and upper respiratory symptoms in the older cohort. For children under age 2, a 50- microg/m3 change in PM10 (the approximate interquartile range) is associated with a 4-12% increase in lower respiratory symptoms. For children 3-15 years of age, the increase in lower respiratory symptoms ranges from 3 to 9% for a 50- microg/m3 change in PM10 and 5% per 50 ppb change in ozone. These magnitudes are similar to results from studies of children undertaken in Western industrial nations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "California Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ostro", "ForeName": "B D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eskeland", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanchez", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feyzioglu", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Office Visits"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Lancet. 1992 Oct 24;340(8826):1010-4", "ArticleIdList": ["1357409"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1993 Jan;147(1):118-24", "ArticleIdList": ["8420404"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1993 Apr 1;137(7):691-700", "ArticleIdList": ["8484360"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Jul 15;146(2):177-85", "ArticleIdList": ["9230780"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Jun;105(6):608-12", "ArticleIdList": ["9288495"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1990 Feb;51(1):51-70", "ArticleIdList": ["2298182"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1997 Feb;155(2):568-76", "ArticleIdList": ["9032196"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1992 Jan;145(1):42-7", "ArticleIdList": ["1731597"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1992 May;145(5):1123-8", "ArticleIdList": ["1586057"]}, {"Citation": "Annu Rev Public Health. 1994;15:107-32", "ArticleIdList": ["8054077"]}, {"Citation": "Bull Pan Am Health Organ. 1991;25(1):47-54", "ArticleIdList": ["2054552"]}, {"Citation": "Pediatrics. 1995 Dec;96(6):1106-10", "ArticleIdList": ["7491229"]}, {"Citation": "J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol. 1996 Jan-Mar;6(1):97-114", "ArticleIdList": ["8777376"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1994 Nov;150(5 Pt 1):1234-42", "ArticleIdList": ["7952546"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9872719", "PMC1566289", "10.1289/ehp.9910769"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
