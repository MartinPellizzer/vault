Although there is a significant amount of data demonstrating the harmful effects of noise on the body, very little is known about how it impacts subsequent responses to other environmental stressors like air pollution, which tend to colocalize in urban centers. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of intermittent noise on cardiovascular function and subsequent responses to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Male Wistar-Kyoto rats implanted with radiotelemeters to non-invasively measure heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), and assess heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were kept in the quiet or exposed to intermittent white noise (85-90\u00a0dB) for one week and then exposed to either O<sub>3</sub> (0.8\u00a0ppm) or filtered air. Left ventricular function and arrhythmia sensitivity were measured 24\u00a0h after exposure. Intermittent noise caused an initial increase in HR and BP, which decreased significantly later in the regimen and coincided with an increase in HRV and BRS. Noise caused HR and BP to be significantly elevated early during O<sub>3</sub> and lower at the end when compared to animals kept in the quiet while the increased HRV and BRS persisted during the 24\u00a0h after. Lastly, noise increased arrhythmogenesis and may predispose the heart to mechanical function changes after O<sub>3</sub>. This is the first study to demonstrate that intermittent noise worsens the cardiovascular response to inhaled O<sub>3</sub>. These effects may occur due to autonomic changes and dysregulation of homeostatic controls, which persist one day after exposure to noise. Hence, co-exposure to noise should be taken into account when assessing the health effects of urban air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiopulmonary and Immunotoxicology Branch, Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 Alexander Drive, B105, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27711, USA. hazari.mehdi@epa.gov."}], "LastName": "Hazari", "ForeName": "Mehdi S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina -
