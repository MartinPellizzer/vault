This study aimed to use a longitudinal birth cohort of children with physician-diagnosed incident asthma to investigate the effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> components at birth on morbidity measured by health services utilization. Of 1277 Toronto Child Health Evaluation Questionnaire (T-CHEQ) participants, the study population included 362 children diagnosed with asthma who were followed for a mean of 13 years from birth until March 31, 2016, or loss-to-follow-up. Concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its components were assigned based on participants' postal codes at birth. Study outcomes included counts of asthma, asthma-related, and all-cause health services use. Poisson regression in single-, two-, and multi-pollutant models was used to estimate rate ratios (RR) per interquartile range (IQR) increase of exposures. Covariates were included in all models to further adjust for potential confounding. The adjusted RR for sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub>) and all-cause hospitalizations was statistically significant with RR\u00a0=\u00a02.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-3.96) in a multi-pollutant model with nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). In multi-pollutant models with oxidants, the adjusted RRs for SO<sub>4</sub> of all-cause hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits were also statistically significant with RR\u00a0=\u00a02.31 (95% CI: 1.32-4.03) and RR\u00a0=\u00a01.39 (95% CI: 1.02-1.90), respectively. While unadjusted single-pollutant RRs for asthma-specific and asthma-related health services use with the SO<sub>4</sub> component of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were above one, none were statistically significant. This study found significant associations with exposure to SO<sub>4</sub> in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and all-cause acute care, chiefly for hospitalizations, in children with asthma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
