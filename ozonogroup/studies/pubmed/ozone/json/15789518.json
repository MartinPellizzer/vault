For the abatement of surface ozone it is becoming evident that processes outside European control will be crucial for meeting long-term aims and air quality guidelines in Europe in the future. Measurements and modelling results indicate that there is a strong link between climate change and surface ozone. A warmer and dryer European climate is very likely to lead to increased ozone concentrations. Furthermore, increased anthropogenic emissions in developing economies in Asia are likely to raise the hemispheric background level of ozone. A significant increase in the background concentration of ozone has been observed at several sites in Northern Europe although the underlying causes are not settled. The photochemical formation of tropospheric ozone from increased concentrations of methane and CO may also lead to a higher ozone level on a global scale. Gradually, these effects may outweigh the effect of the reduced European ozone precursor emissions. This calls for a global or hemispheric perspective in the revision of the European air quality policy for ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute for Air Research, Kjeller, Norway. sverre.solberg@nilu.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solberg", "ForeName": "Sverre", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derwent", "ForeName": "Richard G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hov", "ForeName": "Oystein", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Langner", "ForeName": "Joakim", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lindskog", "ForeName": "Anne", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Sweden", "MedlineTA": "Ambio", "NlmUniqueID": "0364220", "ISSNLinking": "0044-7447"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15789518", "10.1579/0044-7447-34.1.47"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
