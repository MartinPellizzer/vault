The results showed that the variation characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Tianjin from 2016 to 2020 had the trend of pollution occurring in advance and the scope of the pollution expanding. The distribution of O<sub>3</sub> pollution showed significant aggregation from June to October. High-high value clustering areas included six urban districts, Beichen District, Jinnan District, and Jinghai District. O<sub>3</sub> concentration formed high value hot spots in the southwest and low value cold spots in the northeast. Meteorological factors such as temperature, breeze percentage, and sunshine duration, as well as social factors such as NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission, VOCs emission, and motor vehicle ownership had significant effects on O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The regression fitting effect of the integrated drive STIRPAT model was better than that of the single meteorological factor or social factor models. In order to promote scientific and efficient prevention and control of ozone pollution during the 14<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan period, meteorological conditions require attention; under the goal of \"peaking carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality,\" it is necessary for Tianjin to further improve the emission performance of steel, petrochemicals, thermal power, building materials, and other industries, Additionally, clean upgrading, transformation, and green development should be guided for enterprises to reduce VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions. At same time, the increase in fuel vehicle numbers should be controlled, and new energy vehicles should be vigorously promoted to reduce vehicle emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Mei", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ambient Air Particulate Matter Pollution Prevention and Control, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorological Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zi-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jing-Yun", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Nai-Yuan", "Initials": "NY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37694619", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202210168"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
