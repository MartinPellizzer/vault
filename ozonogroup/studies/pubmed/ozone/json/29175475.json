'55/56'\u00a0\u00d7 P.\u00a0deltoides cv. 'Imperial') and 107 (P.\u00a0euramericana cv. '74/76') with a different sensitivity to ozone. Plants were exposed to two ozone treatments, NF (non-filtered ambient air) and NF60 (NF with targeted ozone addition of 60\u00a0ppb), for 96 days in open top chambers (OTCs). Significant ozone effects on most variables of C, N and P ecological stoichiometry were found except for the C concentration and the N/P in different organs. Elevated ozone increased both N and P concentrations of individual organs while for C/N and C/P ratios a reduction was observed. On these variables, ozone had a greater effect for clone 546 than for clone 107. N concentrations of different leaf positions ranked in the order upper\u00a0>\u00a0middle\u00a0>\u00a0lower, showing that N was transferred from the lower senescent leaves to the upper ones. This was also indicative of N resorption processes, which increased under elevated ozone. N resorption of clone 546 was 4 times larger than that of clone 107 under ambient air (NF). However, elevated ozone (NF60) had no significant effect on P resorption for both poplar clones, suggesting that their growth was only limited by N, while available P in the soil was enough to sustain growth. Understanding ecological stoichiometric responses under ozone stress is crucial to predict future effects on ecological processes and biogeochemical cycles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
