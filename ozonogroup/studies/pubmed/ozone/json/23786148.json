The NIST SRP serves as the highest level ozone reference standard in the United States, with NIST SRPs located at NIST and at many U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) laboratories. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) maintains a NIST SRP as the reference standard for international measurement comparability through the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM). In total, there are currently NIST SRPs located in 20 countries for use as an ozone reference standard. A detailed examination of the NIST SRP by the BIPM and NIST has revealed a temperature gradient and optical path-length bias inherent in all NIST SRPs. A temperature gradient along the absorption cells causes incorrect temperature measurements by as much as 2 degrees C. Additionally, the temperature probe used for temperature measurements was found to inaccurately measure the temperature of the sample gas due to a self-heating effect. Multiple internal reflections within the absorption cells produce an actual path length longer than the measured fixed length used in the calculations for ozone mole fractions. Reflections from optical filters located at the exit of the absorption cells add to this effect. Because all NIST SRPs are essentially identical, the temperature and path-length biases exist on all units by varying amounts dependent upon instrument settings, laboratory conditions, and absorption cell window alignment. This paper will discuss the cause of and physical modifications for reducing these measurement biases in NIST SRPs. Results from actual NIST SRP bias upgrades quantifying the effects of these measurement biases on ozone measurements are summarized.", "NIST SRPs are maintained in laboratories around the world underpinning ozone measurement calibration and traceability within and between countries. The work described in this paper quantifies and shows the reduction of instrument biases in NIST SRPs improving their overall agreement. This improved agreement in all NIST SRPs provides a more stable baseline for ozone measurements worldwide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA. jnorris@nist.gov"}], "LastName": "Norris", "ForeName": "James E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choquette", "ForeName": "Steven J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Viallon", "ForeName": "Joele", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moussay", "ForeName": "Philippe", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wielgosz", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guenther", "ForeName": "Franklin R", "Initials": "FR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selection Bias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23786148", "10.1080/10962247.2013.773951"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
