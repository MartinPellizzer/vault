The filamentous mycelium was interrupted, and the SVI was decreased to 125 mL\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> after ozone dosage with a low concentration of 0.085 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>(O<sub>3</sub>/MLSS) for 20 days, which indicated the disappearance of the sludge bulking. The performance of nitrification and phosphorus removal efficiency was not affected obviously. However, the sludge settleability deteriorated with a high dosage of ozone, and the phosphorus removal efficiency was decreased to around 60%. Further study showed that PS/PN had a positive correlation with SVI with the correlation coefficient of 0.9381, which can be used to characterize sludge settleability. A low ozone dosage not only interrupted the filamentous mycelium, but it also affected the content and composition of the EPS, which led to improved settleability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Membrane Seperation of Shaanxi Province, Research Institute of Membrane Seperation Technology of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Yong-Tao", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Membrane Seperation of Shaanxi Province, Research Institute of Membrane Seperation Technology of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chuan-Shou", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Membrane Seperation of Shaanxi Province, Research Institute of Membrane Seperation Technology of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xu-Yang", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Membrane Seperation of Shaanxi Province, Research Institute of Membrane Seperation Technology of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Modern Architecture Design & Research Institute, Xi'an 710024, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yong-Bao", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Modern Architecture Design & Research Institute, Xi'an 710024, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Modern Architecture Design & Research Institute, Xi'an 710024, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Shuang-Ke", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Membrane Seperation of Shaanxi Province, Research Institute of Membrane Seperation Technology of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutrients"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34212666", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202012051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
