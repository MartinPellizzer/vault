However, widespread application of HCO is still limited due to the typically low efficacy of catalysts used and matrix passivation effects. To this end, we prepared an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-supported Fe catalyst with high reactivity via a facile urea-based heterogeneous precipitation method. Due to the nonsintering nature of the preparation method, a heterogeneous catalytic layer comprised of \u03b3-FeOOH and \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is formed on the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> support (termed NS-Fe-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). On treatment of a real industrial effluent by HCO, the presence of NS-Fe-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> increased the removal of organics by \u223c100% compared to that achieved with a control catalyst (i.e., \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or \u03b3-FeOOH/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) that was prepared by a conventional impregnation and calcination method. Furthermore, our results confirmed that the novel NS-Fe-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst demonstrated resistance to the inhibitory effect of high concentration of chloride and sulfate ions usually present in industrial effluent. A mathematical kinetic model was developed that adequately describes the mechanism of HCO process in the presence of NS-Fe-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Overall, the results presented here provide valuable guidance for the synthesis of effective and robust catalysts that will facilitate the wider industrial application of HCO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Xiangtong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Shikha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Mortazavi", "ForeName": "Mahshid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5087-3972"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for City Cluster Environmental Safety and Green Development of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental and Ecological Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou510006, P.R.
