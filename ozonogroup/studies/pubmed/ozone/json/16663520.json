The greatest increase following a 2-hour ozone exposure (0.4 microliters O(3) per liter) was observed in extracellular peroxidases. Most of the main bands of peroxidase activity separated by isoelectric focusing exhibited an increase upon exposure to ozone. Incubation experiments with isolated peeled or unpeeled leaves showed that leaves from ozone-treated plants release much more peroxidases in the medium than untreated leaves. The withdrawal of Ca(2+) ions reduced the level of extracellular peroxidase activity either in whole plants or in incubation experiments. This reduction and the activation obtained after addition of Ca(2+) resulted from a direct requirement of Ca(2+) by the enzyme and from an effect of Ca(2+) on peroxidase secretion. The ionophore A23187 promoted an increase of extracellular peroxidase activity only in untreated plants. The release of peroxidases by untreated and ozone-treated leaves is considerably lowered by metabolic inhibitors (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and sodium azide) and by puromycin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physiologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, 3 Place de l'Universit\u00e9, 1211 Gen\u00e8ve 4, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castillo", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Penel", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greppin", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1973 Apr 20;180(4083):296-8", "ArticleIdList": ["17816289"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 May 7;72:248-54", "ArticleIdList": ["942051"]}, {"Citation": "J Cell Sci. 1981 Apr;48:345-53", "ArticleIdList": ["6792211"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1978 Nov;62(5):789-93", "ArticleIdList": ["16660607"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1974 Feb;53(2):317-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16658698"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Jul;70(1):318-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16662471"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1977 Oct;74(10):4214-8", "ArticleIdList": ["270665"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1978 Feb 28;80(4):1039-42", "ArticleIdList": ["416823"]}, {"Citation": "J Cell Biol. 1978 Dec;79(3):694-707", "ArticleIdList": ["103883"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16663520", "PMC1066779", "10.1104/pp.74.4.846"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
