Therefore, five high-speed and highly accurate hybrid models were developed and compared to simulate diffuse radiation based on the aerosol optical properties and radiation parameters provided by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), Wuhan University, Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN), GLASS surface albedo data, and combined radiative transfer model (RTM) with machine learning (ML) models that include random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), deep neural networks (DNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, the uncertainty in the simulated diffuse radiation due to the measurement uncertainties of aerosol optical properties and land surface albedo was quantified, and the relative contributions of multiple variables to diffuse radiation were analyzed. The results showed that RTM-RF was the most successful, with determination coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.98, and minimum root mean square errors (RMSE) of 9.56, 10.05, and 13.27 W m<sup>-2</sup> at the Lulin, Wuhan, and Xianghe sites, respectively. The largest measurement uncertainty in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) was found at the Lulin site, while that of the single-scattering albedo led to the largest errors in Wuhan and Xianghe. AOD, solar zenith angle (SZA), and single-scattering albedo contributed significantly more than the asymmetry factor, land surface albedo, precipitable water vapor, and ozone. This was especially true for AOD, which was higher than 28 % at all sites. Overall, the proposed RTM-RF method exhibited superior performance, therefore we recommend it for estimating diffuse radiation in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
