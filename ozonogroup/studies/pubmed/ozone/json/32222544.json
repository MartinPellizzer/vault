A total of 297 ARGs within 17 types were detected in the drinking water, and their total relative abundance ranged from 195.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.85 to 626.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a038.61 copies of ARGs per cell. The total ARG abundance was significantly increased after the antimicrobial resin and ultraviolet (AR/UV) disinfection while significantly decreased after the ozone and chlorine (O<sub>3</sub>/Cl<sub>2</sub>) disinfection and remained stable after AR/Cl<sub>2</sub> disinfection. Overall, 18 ARGs including bacA, mexT, and bla<sub>OXA-12</sub>, mainly affiliated to bacitracin, multidrug, and beta-lactam, were persistent and discriminative during all the disinfection strategies in drinking water, and they were considered as key ARGs that represent the antibiotic resistome during drinking water disinfection. Additionally, possible hosts of 50% key ARGs were revealed based on co-occurrence network. During multiple disinfection processes, the change of Fusobacteriales and Aeromonadaceae in abundance mainly contributed to the abundance shift of bacA, and Pseudomonas mainly increased the abundance of mexT. These findings indicated that bacterial community shift may be the key factor driving the change of antibiotic resistome during disinfection. The strong association between antibiotic resistome alteration and bacterial community shift proposed in this study may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanism of the disinfection effects on antibiotic resistance and benefit effective measures to improve safety of drinking water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
