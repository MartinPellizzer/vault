This technology allows the development of ozone-friendly inhaled drugs that replace the same doses of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-formulated products and enables the attainment of new formulations with extra-fine particles and improved lung deposition. Clinical pharmacology, as well as clinical studies against comparators, have demonstrated that formoterol Modulite and the existing dry powder inhaler and CFC formoterol formulations have a similar pharmacokinetic profile, are clinically equivalent in bronchodilating effects and exhibit a similar potential for systemic side effects. Therefore, the Modulite formoterol hydrofluoroalkane-based formulation in extra-fine particles is a valuable therapeutic option for both patients and physicians in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "H\u00f4pital Arnaud de Villeneuve 371, Avenue du Doyen Gaston Giraud, FR-34000, Montpellier, France. bousquet@montp.inserm.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bousquet", "ForeName": "Jean", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dell'anna", "ForeName": "Carmen", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Rev Respir Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101278196", "ISSNLinking": "1747-6348"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20477219", "10.1586/17476348.2.1.27"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
