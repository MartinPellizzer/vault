We hypothesize that macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic mediators contribute to the pathogenic process. Treatment of rats with ozone (2 ppm, 3 h) results in damage to the alveolar epithelium and increased protein in lung lavage fluid. This is associated with an increase in the number of macrophages in the lung. We found that these cells are activated to release the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) which has been implicated in tissue injury. Following ozone inhalation, alveolar macrophages also produce increased amounts of the cytotoxic mediator, nitric oxide. This response is time-dependent and correlated with expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) protein and mRNA. Inhibition of macrophages with gadolinium chloride abrogates ozone-induced inflammation, mediator production and tissue injury. These data demonstrate, that macrophages and mediators they release contribute to irritant-induced lung injury. Ozone inhalation also caused alterations in the liver, including increased nitric oxide production and protein synthesis suggesting that ozone induces an acute phase response. We speculate that this is mediated by cytokines such as TNF alpha produced by alveolar macrophages. In this regard we noted increased expression of TNF alpha in both lung and liver tissue. Thus cytokines produced locally by macrophages following toxicant exposure may exert pathophysiologic effects outside the target organ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers University and University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854-8020, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heck", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES04738", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES06897", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "GM34310", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10022268", "10.1016/s0378-4274(98)00316-6", "S0378-4274(98)00316-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
