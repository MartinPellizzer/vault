Responses of subjects and experimental methods were compared in a cooperative investigation of this apparent difference in reactivity. Four Canadians and four Californians were exposed to 0.37 ppm O3 in purified air at 21 degrees C and 50% relative humidity for 2 hours with intermittent light exercise. Exposures to purified air alone served as controls. Responses of subjects were similar to those observed previously: Canadians on the average showed greater clinical and physiological reactivity to exposure than did Californians, who were no more than minimally reactive. Canadians also showed larger increases in erythrocyte fragility following exposure. No methodological differences sufficient to explain different results of previous studies were found. Although other possible explanations have not been ruled out entirely, adaptation of southern Californians to chronic ambient O3 exposure is a rational hypothesis to explain these results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hackney", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linn", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karuza", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buckley", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Law", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bates", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hazucha", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pengelly", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silverman", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ontario"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Total Lung Capacity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["869593", "10.1080/00039896.1977.10667265"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
