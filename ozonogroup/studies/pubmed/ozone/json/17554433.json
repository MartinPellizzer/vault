The comparison presented considers precision, bias, accuracy, selectivity, detection limit, cost and applicability. For assessing precision, co-located samplers were exposed in duplicate in two reference-sampling sites, beside UV-photometric ozone analyser. Bias was calculated comparing results of passive samplers exposed in three reference-sampling sites and two contrast-sampling sites with the measurements given by the reference analysers. Accuracy was calculated following the EN 482:1994 standard. The limit of detection was calculated as 3 times the standard deviation of the blanks in a batch of passive samplers. The compared Radiello passive samplers give a precision of 5.2%, a bias of 13.8%, an accuracy of 20.5% and a limit of detection of 12.6 microg m(-3). The selectivity and applicability of this methodology is in both aspects successful. Surface ozone levels measured with passive samplers were comparable with the averaged values measured with the reference analyser both in the reference-sampling sites and in the contrast-sampling sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Birmingham, School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Birmingham, UK. delgadjm@bham.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delgado Saborit", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Esteve Cano", "ForeName": "V J", "Initials": "VJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17554433", "10.1039/b618075b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
