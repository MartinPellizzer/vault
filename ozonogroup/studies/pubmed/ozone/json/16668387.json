The aim of the study was to establish exposure-response relationships for the radiation-weighted seasonal mean O(3) concentration and delta(13)C (relative deviation of the (13)C/(12)C ratio) values of the two plant parts. Samples were collected at harvest in 1986, 1987, and 1988. With increasing O(3) concentration, delta(13)C values increased (became less negative) proportionally. Year to year delta(13)C differences at equivalent O(3) concentrations were small. The shift in delta(13)C caused by O(3) was more pronounced in grain than in leaves. According to models of (13)C discrimination in C(3) plants, these results indicate increasing limitation of photosynthesis by CO(2) diffusion relative to limitation by carboxylation with increasing O(3) exposure. This conclusion is not in agreement with results from gas exchange analysis. Water use efficiency in green flag leaves tended to decrease with increasing O(3), indicating a dominating effect of O(3) on CO(2) carboxylation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Institute, University of Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saurer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuhrer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siegenthaler", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1989;60(3-4):273-89", "ArticleIdList": ["15092381"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1988;53(1-4):135-49", "ArticleIdList": ["15092546"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1990;65(2):181-92", "ArticleIdList": ["15092274"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1977 Oct;60(4):606-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16660147"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Dec;88(4):1115-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16666430"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Sep;88(1):218-23", "ArticleIdList": ["16666270"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1985 Nov 1;230(4725):566-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17809689"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16668387", "PMC1080999", "10.1104/pp.97.1.313"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
