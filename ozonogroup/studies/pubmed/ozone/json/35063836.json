This study investigated simultaneously capturing and inactivating/oxidizing the antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and cell-free antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in waters by flexibly-functionalized microbubbles. The microbubbles were obtained by surface-modifying the bubbles with coagulant (named as coagulative colloidal gas aphrons, CCGAs) and further encapsulating ozone in the gas core (named as coagulative colloidal ozone aphrons, CCOAs). CCGAs removed 92.4-97.5% of the sulfamethoxazole-resistant bacteria in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and the log reduction of cell-free ARGs (particularly, those encoded in plasmid) reached 1.86-3.30. The ozone release from CCOAs led to efficient in-situ oxidation: 91.2% of ARB were membrane-damaged and inactivated. In the municipal wastewater matrix, the removal of ARB increased whilst that of cell-free ARGs decreased by CCGAs with the DOM content increasing. The ozone encapsulation into CCGAs reinforced the bubble performance. The predominant capture mechanism should be electrostatic attraction between bubbles and ARB (or cell-free ARGs), and DOM enhanced the sweeping and bridging effect. The functionalized microbubble technology can be a promising and effective barrier for ARB and cell-free ARGs with shortened retention time, lessened chemical doses and simplified treatment unit."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
