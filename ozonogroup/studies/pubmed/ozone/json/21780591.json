The O3 dose was designed at 28 mg x L(-1) for 30 min and 42 mg x L(-1) for 80 min. Pollutants in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen can not be removed efficiently, ranged from 3% to 7%. The colority of the black water was quickly reduced in the first 5 minutes, while the turbidities increased first and then decreased gradually. It showed that three EDs with relatively high level including BPA, OP and EE2 could be removed efficiently in thirty minutes. Concentrations of E3 increased first then decreased to be lower than the detection limit. Removal efficiencies of E1 and E2 were 41%-70% and 62%-85% respectively. Extension of ozone exposure time can not improve the efficiency of EDs removal any more."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Engineering and Management, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China. wangly06@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ling-yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xi-hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Qian-wu", "Initials": "QW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21780591"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
