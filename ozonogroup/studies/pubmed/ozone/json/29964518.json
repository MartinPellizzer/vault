It was found that bromate concentration would exceed 10.00 \u03bcg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> as ozone doses were higher than 1.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> under different water qualities. Ammonia and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>could effectively control bromate formation and bromate concentration decreased as ammonia and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> doses increased. Bromate concentration could be controlled below 10.00 \u03bcg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> as ammonia dose was 0.10-0.30 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> or the <i>m</i>(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)/<i>m</i>(O<sub>3</sub>) was 0.2-1.0. However, as ammonia-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was combined for the same purpose, bromate increased firstly and then decreased. Ammonia addition would not significantly affect the THMFP control but H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> application would depress the efficiency of THMFP removal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Food and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Jing", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Food and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Food and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Food and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Si-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Food and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ming-Lu", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jian-Wei", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964518", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201605091"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
