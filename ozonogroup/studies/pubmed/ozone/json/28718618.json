Here, we report an efficient approach to direct UV-ozone treatment by larger device performance enhancement employing graphene oxide (GO). The dramatic performance enhancement of PSCs with the P3HT:PCBM blend as an active layer was demonstrated by the UV-ozone treatment of GO for 30 min: best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.18%, fill factor of 0.63, J<sub>sc</sub> of 10.94 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and V<sub>oc</sub> of 0.61 V, which are significantly higher than those of the untreated GO (1.82%) and highly comparable PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs (3.73%). In addition, PSCs with UV-ozone-treated GO showed a longer stability than PSCs with PEDOT:PSS. The significant enhancement of PCEs of PSCs can be attributed to the fact that ozone molecules can oxidize GO into CO<sub>2</sub> and leave highly conductive graphene particles. We suggest that this simple UV-ozone treatment can provide an efficient method for highly efficient GO hole extraction in high-performance PSCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Yingdong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yufeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Haijuan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yiting", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yonghua", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7004-6408"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Organic Electronics & Information Displays and IAM, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications , 9 Wenyuan Road, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28718618", "10.1021/acsami.7b05422"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
