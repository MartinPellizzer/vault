To date, however, much less is known about the combined effects of two of these factors on isoprene emission from plants. We investigated for the first time the combined effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure (CF, charcoal-filtered air; EO<sub>3</sub>, non-filtered air plus 40\u00a0ppb of O<sub>3</sub>), N addition (N0, no additional N; N50, 50\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> of N) and moderate drought (WW, well-watered; WR, 40% of WW irrigation) on photosynthetic carbon assimilation and ISO emission in hybrid poplar at both leaf- and plant-level over time. Consistent with leaf-level photosynthesis (Pn<sub>leaf</sub>) and ISO (ISO<sub>leaf</sub>) responses, plant-level ISO (ISO<sub>plant</sub>) responses to O<sub>3</sub>, N addition and moderate drought were more marked after long exposure (September) than short exposure duration (July). EO<sub>3</sub> significantly decreased ISO<sub>leaf</sub> and Pn<sub>leaf</sub>, while WR and N50 significantly increased them. Although O<sub>3</sub> and water interacted significantly to affect Pn<sub>leaf</sub> over the exposure duration, neither N50 nor WR mitigated the negative effects of EO<sub>3</sub> on ISO<sub>leaf</sub>. When ISO was scaled up to the plant level, the WR-induced increase in ISO<sub>leaf</sub> under EO<sub>3</sub> was offset by a reduction in total leaf area. By contrast, effects of EO<sub>3</sub> on ISO<sub>plant</sub> were not changed by N addition. Our results highlight that the dynamic effects on ISO emission change over the exposure duration depending on involved co-occurring factors and evaluation scales."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
