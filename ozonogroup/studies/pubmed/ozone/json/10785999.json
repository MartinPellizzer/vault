The results aim to provide information on the actual effect of MTBE on a fleet that represents more than 60% of the in-use vehicles in the MAMC. Ten vehicles were tested with a low-octane base gasoline, and 10 more with a regular-grade unleaded base gasoline. Three MTBE concentrations, 5, 10, and 15 vol %, were tested following the U.S. Federal Test Procedure (FTP). CO, total HC, and NOx from the exhaust gases were quantitatively evaluated and also characterized for FTP speciated organic emissions. From this data, the O3-forming potential of the fuels was calculated. Results show that for the fleet using low-octane gasoline, the addition of 10% MTBE substantially reduced CO emissions, but total HC concentration in the exhaust showed a modest decrease. For the regular gasoline, the 10% MTBE blend seemed to be the best choice, but there was not a significant decrease in emissions. The specific reactivity of each fuel, expressed in grams of O3 per gram of nonmethane organic gases, increased with MTBE concentration in both cases. This result is important to consider, especially for a region like Mexico City, which has high atmospheric O3 concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Transformaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00e9ticos, Instituto Mexicano del Petr\u00f3leo, Mexico D.F., Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schifter", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avalos", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vera", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barrera", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez-Salinas", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29I4YB3S89", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl tert-butyl ether"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10785999", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464042"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
