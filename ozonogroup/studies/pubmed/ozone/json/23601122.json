As kO3 values are only available for hundreds of compounds, and experimental determination of kO3 is costly and time-consuming, it is of importance to develop predictive models on kO3. In this study, a total of 379 logkO3 values at different temperatures were used to develop and validate a model for the prediction of kO3, based on quantum chemical descriptors, Dragon descriptors and structural fragments. Molecular descriptors were screened by stepwise multiple linear regression, and the model was constructed by partial least-squares regression. The cross validation coefficient QCUM(2) of the model is 0.836, and the external validation coefficient Qext(2) is 0.811, indicating that the model has high robustness and good predictive performance. The most significant descriptor explaining logkO3 is the BELm2 descriptor with connectivity information weighted atomic masses. kO3 increases with increasing BELm2, and decreases with increasing ionization potential. The applicability domain of the proposed model was visualized by the Williams plot. The developed model can be used to predict kO3 at different temperatures for a wide range of organic chemicals, including alkenes, cycloalkenes, haloalkenes, alkynes, oxygen-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds (except primary amines) and aromatic compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
