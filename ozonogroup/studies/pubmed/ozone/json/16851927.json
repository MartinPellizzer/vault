Adsorption by ice crystals may alter its photochemistry in different ways. We have simulated the photodissociation of a ClOOCl molecule adsorbed on ice by means of a semiclassical representation of the excited state dynamics. Electronic energies and wave functions of ClOOCl are computed by an ad hoc reparametrized semiempirical method, and the interaction with ice is taken into account by a QM/MM strategy. The reaction mechanism is similar to what was previously found for the isolated molecule: sequential or almost simultaneous breaking of both Cl-O bonds leads to the 2Cl + O2 reaction products in most cases. The Cl atoms remain temporarily adsorbed on the ice surface, whereas O2 is ejected. The main effect for the overall chlorine chemistry is probably an increase of the photodissociation rates at long wavelengths, due to the change of adsorption cross sections induced by the interaction with ice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica e Chimica Industriale, via Risorgimento 35, 56126 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inglese", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Granucci", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laino", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Persico", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem B", "NlmUniqueID": "101157530", "ISSNLinking": "1520-5207"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16851927", "10.1021/jp044368k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
