Rate data are obtained using both relative and absolute rate techniques, and the measured rate coefficients are found to be in good agreement. The results show that the reactivity of the compounds with respect to addition of ozone to the double bond is a function of the nature of the oxygenated substituent. Product distribution studies on the reactions provide information on the decomposition pathways for the primary ozonides, and on the effect of the oxygenated group on the relative importance of the degradation pathways. The results are discussed in terms of their importance in the atmospheric oxidation of unsaturated oxygenated compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al Mulla", "ForeName": "Ismael", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Viera", "ForeName": "Lisa", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morris", "ForeName": "Rebecca", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sidebottom", "ForeName": "Howard", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Treacy", "ForeName": "Jack", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "Abdelwahid", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Chemphyschem", "NlmUniqueID": "100954211", "ISSNLinking": "1439-4235"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20806311", "10.1002/cphc.201000404"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
