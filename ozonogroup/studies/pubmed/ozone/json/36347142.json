Designing novel metal-based catalysts and exploring their structural-activity relationship continued to be a hot topic in HCO. Herein, we reviewed the recent development of metal-based catalysts (including monometallic and polymetallic catalysts) in HCO. Regulation of metal based active sites (surface hydroxyl groups, Lewis acid sites, metal redox cycle and surface defect) and their key roles in activating O<sub>3</sub> were explored. Advantage and disadvantage of conventional characterization techniques on monitoring metal active sites were claimed. In situ electrochemical characterization and DFT simulation were recommended as supplement to reveal the metal active species. Though the ambiguous interfacial behaviors of O<sub>3</sub> at these active sites, the existence of interfacial electron migration was beyond doubt. The reported metal-based catalysts mainly served as electron donator for O<sub>3</sub>, which resulted in the accumulation of oxidized metal and reduced their activity. Design of polymetallic catalysts could accelerate the interfacial electron migration, but they still faced with the dilemma of sluggish Me<sup>(n+m)+</sup>/Me<sup>n+</sup> redox cycle. Alternative strategies like coupling active metal species with mesoporous silicon materials, regulating surface hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties, polaring surface electron distribution, coupling HCO process with photocatalysis and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were proposed for future research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
