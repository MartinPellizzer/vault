Studies of known effects of aromatic hydrocarbons, other organics, dioxins, metals, and gases, on fish, soils, plants, and particularly humans are briefly reviewed. A summary of potential problems with existing and proposed incineration is developed, including: (1) lack of toxicity data on unidentified organic emissions; (2) unavoidability of hazardous metal emissions as particles and volatiles; (3) inefficient stack operation resulting in unknown amounts of increased emissions; (4) formation in the stack of highly toxic dioxins and furans, especially under inefficient conditions, and their build-up in the environment and in human tissue; (5) the lack of adequate disposal techniques for incinerator fly ash and wash-water; (6) the contribution of emitted gases such as NO2, SO2 and HCL to smog, acid rain, and the formation of ozone, and the deleterious effects of these on human respiratory systems; (7) the effects and build-up in human tissue of other emitted organics such as benzene, toluene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), alkanes, alcohols, and phenols; (8) lack of pollution-control and real-time efficiency-monitoring equipment in existing installations. The inability of regulatory bodies historically to ensure compliance with emission standards is discussed, and a concluding opinion is offered that it is inadvisable to engage in new incinerator construction with present knowledge and conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thought Transfer Research, North Augusta, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rowat", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Hypotheses", "NlmUniqueID": "7505668", "ISSNLinking": "0306-9877"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Med Hypotheses 2000 Feb;54(2):342"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dioxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Incineration"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10416945", "10.1054/mehy.1994.0675", "S0306-9877(84)70675-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
