Exposure to O3 results in the release of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) by alveolar macrophages. In addition, O3 exposure results in an increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which inhibits the synthesis of TNF-alpha and IL-1 by macrophages and decreases the expression of iNOS. To test the protective properties of IL-10 in vivo, on the pulmonary injury induced by O3 exposure, we intratracheally instilled rat recombinant IL-10 1 h prior to O3 exposure (0.8 ppm x 3 h). Approximately 10-12 h following exposure, the animals were sacrificed and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collected. The quantification of albumin, protein and fibronectin in the BALF provided a means of assessing pulmonary injury while the analysis of the BALF cells reflected the inflammatory response. Ozone exposure resulted in a significant (P<0.05) increase in BALF albumin, protein and fibronectin content as compared to air-exposed controls. In addition, significant increases in the percentage of BALF polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and tissue expression of fibronectin mRNA were observed. The intratracheal instillation of IL-10 prior to O3 exposure resulted in a significant reduction in BALF albumin, protein and fibronectin content, and lung fibronectin mRNA as compared to O3 exposure alone. The data shows that IL-10, when given intratracheally, significantly reduces the pulmonary injury following O3 exposure in the rat. However, since the PMNs and the levels of albumin, protein and fibronectin in the IL-10 treated group did not reach baseline values, we conclude that other mediators of inflammation and injury not regulated by IL-10 also contribute to the pathophysiology of O3-induced lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reinhart", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhalla", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES03521", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibronectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "130068-27-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-10"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibronectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-10"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophil Infiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10593593", "10.1016/s0378-4274(99)00136-8", "S0378-4274(99)00136-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
