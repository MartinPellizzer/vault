Healthy young adults (n = 485) were exposed for 2 h to one of six ozone concentrations while exercising at one of three levels. Candidate models were fitted to portions of the data and evaluated on the basis of their ability to predict the mean response of independent samples. A sigmoid-shaped model that is consistent with previous observations of ozone exposure-response (E-R) characteristics was identified and found to accurately predict the mean response with independent data. This model in a more general form may allow the prediction of responses under conditions of changing C and VE. We did not find that response was more sensitive to changes in C than in VE, nor did we find convincing evidence of an effect of body size upon response. We did find that response to ozone decreases with age. In summary, we have identified a biologically plausible, predictive model that quantifies the relationship between the ozone-induced change in FEV1, and C, VE, T, and age."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonnell", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stewart", "ForeName": "P W", "Initials": "PW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andreoni", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seal", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kehrl", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horstman", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Constitution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9309984", "10.1164/ajrccm.156.3.9611044"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
