The removal of Hg(0) by NTP is found to be time-dependent and proceed through three domains; the Hg(0) concentration just slightly decreases as soon as NTP is initiated and then becomes constant for several minutes (Region 1), thereafter starts to decrease rapidly for 1h (Region 2) and, after passing fall-off region, very slowly decreases for about 4h (Region 3). The deposited mercury species on the reactor surface were conglomerated like islands, rather than dispersed uniformly, and their ratio of Hg(0) to O composition is observed to be 1:2. Additionally, the new peak in TPDD spectra observed in the region of 260-380\u00b0C is proposed as HgO(3). These results lead us to conclude that the deposited mercury species by NTP have extra O atoms to oxidize the adsorbed Hg(0), resulting in the acceleration of removal rate as the oxidation of Hg(0) proceeds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
