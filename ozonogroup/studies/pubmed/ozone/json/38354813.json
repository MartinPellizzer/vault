Therefore, this study investigated the decadal, interannual, and seasonal changes in aerosol optical properties, vegetation index, and meteorological parameters in the northwest Indian region (8 boxes). Using GIOVANNI (Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) Online Visualization and Analysis Infrastructure), we retrieved daily and monthly Aqua and Terra MODIS products of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and OMI aerosol index (AI) to examine the spatiotemporal variations by using statistical approaches. The results demonstrated that the decadal averages of aerosol properties showed values of AOD 0.35 (Aqua) and 0.34 (Terra) and AE 1.20 (Aqua) and 1.10 (Terra) with the highest levels during the post-monsoon. Notably, the mean interannual concentrations of AOD and NDVI consistently surpass 0.3, and AE and AI exceed 1 in most locations, underscoring the persistence of high aerosol loading. Also, the study revealed a negative decadal change in AOD of about -8.24\u00a0%, while AE, AI, and NDVI showed positive decadal changes of about 9.24\u00a0%, 15.09\u00a0%, and 12.67\u00a0%, respectively. In addition, aerosol optical properties and local meteorology strongly correlated (-0.8 to +0.8). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identifies meteorological parameters as significant drivers, with the first three components explaining over 70\u00a0% of the variation in aerosol optical properties. The NOAA HYSPLIT trajectory model suggests that the long-distance dust transport from the Arabian Peninsula frequently penetrates Gujarat province and then to northwest India. The results contributed to air quality management strategies and provided valuable insights into regional climate and air quality with the influence of meteorology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
