Ozone fumigation had weak effects on the analysed metabolites of both tree species and significant changes in the contents of total glutathione, NSP, and soluble sugars were observed only selectively. Beech leaves were affected by crown position to a higher extent than spruce needles and exhibited lower contents of total glutathione and NSP and total soluble sugars, but enhanced contents of oxidised glutathione and amino compounds in the shade compared to the sun crown. Contents of total soluble sugars generally were decreased in shade compared to sun needles of spruce trees. Interspecific differences between beech and spruce were more distinct in the sun compared to the shade crown. Contents of total glutathione were increased whilst contents of amino compounds and total soluble sugars were lower in spruce needles compared to beech leaves. The metabolites determined showed individual patterns in the course of the five measurement years. Contents of total glutathione and its redox state correlated with air temperature and global radiation, indicating an important role for the antioxidant at low temperatures. Correlations of glutathione with instantaneous ozone concentrations seem to be a secondary effect. Differences in proteins and/or amino compounds in the inter-annual course are assumed to be a consequence of alterations in specific N uptake rates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forest Botany and Tree Physiology, Chair of Tree Physiology, Albert Ludwigs University, Georges-K\u00f6hler-Allee 053/054, 79110 Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alexou", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hofer", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rennenberg", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haberer", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Picea"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17357017", "10.1055/s-2006-924648"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
