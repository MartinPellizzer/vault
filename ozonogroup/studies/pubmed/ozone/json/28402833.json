To decrease costs and limit doses, different peroxone (hydrogen peroxide/ozone; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>3</sub>) processes using mild-ozone doses of 30 and 50\u00a0mg/L were investigated. The degradation efficiency of O<sub>x</sub>-NAs (classical (O<sub>2</sub>-NAs)\u00a0+\u00a0oxidized NAs) improved from 58% at 30\u00a0mg/L ozone to 59%, 63% and 76% at peroxone (1:1), 50\u00a0mg/L ozone, and peroxone (1:2), respectively. Suppressing the hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) pathway by adding tert-butyl alcohol did significantly reduce the degradation in all treatments, while molecular ozone contribution was around 50% and 34% for O<sub>2</sub>-NAs and O<sub>x</sub>-NAs, respectively. Structure reactivity toward degradation was observed with degradation increase for both O<sub>2</sub>-NAs and O<sub>x</sub>-NAs with increase of both carbon (n) and hydrogen deficiency/or |-Z| numbers in all treatments. However, the combined effect of n and Z showed specific insights and differences between ozone and peroxone treatments. The degradation pathway for |-Z|\u226510 isomers in ozone treatments through molecular ozone was significant compared to \u2022OH. Though peroxone (1:2) highly reduced the fluorophore organics and toxicity to Vibrio fischeri, the best oxidant utilization in the degradation of O<sub>2</sub>-NAs (mg/L) per ozone dose (mg/L) was observed in the peroxone (1:1) (0.91) and 30\u00a0mg/L ozone treatments (0.92). At n\u00a0=\u00a09-11, peroxone (1:1) had similar or enhanced effect on the O<sub>2</sub>-NAs degradation compared to 50\u00a0mg/L ozone. Enhancing \u2022OH pathway through peroxone versus ozone may be an effective OSPW treatment that will allow its safe release into receiving environments with marginal cost addition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
