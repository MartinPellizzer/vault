Different from previous region-based studies, we pay special attention to meteorological influences at city scale. Over 2015-2019, daily changes in key meteorological parameters could explain 47%-74% of the observed daily variations in summertime MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and four cities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Hefei), with RH being the top driver. Over years of 2015-2020, daily concentrations of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> obtained from MLR equations (MDA8O<sub>3</sub>_MLR) of the local cities always had better performance than those of YRD. Compared with the observed daily MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in June-July-August (JJA) over the studied period, daily MDA8O<sub>3</sub>_MLR of the local cities (of YRD) had correlation coefficients of 0.73 (0.63), 0.75 (0.74), 0.79 (0.78), and 0.76 (0.73) in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Hefei, respectively, and the MDA8O<sub>3</sub>_MLR of the local cities (of YRD) captured 54% (17%), 63% (51%), 52% (27%) of the observed O<sub>3</sub>-polluted days (days with MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration exceeding 160 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>) in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, respectively. The meteorologically driven trends (Trend_Met) in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> were calculated using the established MLR equations. Over 2015-2019, the observed trends (Trend_Obs) and Trend_Met in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> were mostly positive in YRD, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Hefei. In Shanghai, Trend_Obs, Trend_Met, and anthropogenically driven trend (estimated as Trend_Obs minus Trend_Met) of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in JJA over 2015-2019 were -1.3, +1.0, and -2.3 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, indicating that the emission control measures alleviated O<sub>3</sub> pollution in this city. Our results suggest that it is necessary to establish MLR equations at city scale to account for the role of meteorology in the actions of O<sub>3</sub> pollution control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
