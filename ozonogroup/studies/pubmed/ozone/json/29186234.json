Chem. Phys., 2017, 146, 244302]. CH<sub>2</sub>OO was prepared by photolyzing a gas mixture of CH<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> at 352 nm; the photolysis wavelength was chosen to minimize the photodissociation of O<sub>3</sub>. The measured rate coefficient at 298 K and 30 Torr is (6.7 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10<sup>-14</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, independent of pressure from 30 to 100 Torr. The result indicates that previous ab initio calculations either underestimated or overestimated this reaction rate by one order of magnitude or more. The result also implies that, the reaction of the Criegee intermediate with ozone may play a role in laboratory studies of ozonolysis of alkenes. However, this reaction would not compete with other CH<sub>2</sub>OO sinks in the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan. ypchang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Pin", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hsun-Hui", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jim Jr-Min", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29186234", "10.1039/c7cp06653h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
