Although bromine chemistry has been shown to initiate ozone depletion events, and it has long been hypothesized that iodine chemistry may contribute, no previous measurements of molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) have been reported in the Arctic. Iodine chemistry also contributes to atmospheric new particle formation and therefore cloud properties and radiative forcing. Here we present Arctic atmospheric I<sub>2</sub> and snowpack iodide (I<sup>-</sup>) measurements, which were conducted near Utqia\u0121vik, AK, in February 2014. Using chemical ionization mass spectrometry, I<sub>2</sub> was observed in the atmosphere at mole ratios of 0.3-1.0 ppt, and in the snowpack interstitial air at mole ratios up to 22 ppt under natural sunlit conditions and up to 35 ppt when the snowpack surface was artificially irradiated, suggesting a photochemical production mechanism. Further, snow meltwater I<sup>-</sup> measurements showed enrichments of up to \u223c1,900 times above the seawater ratio of I<sup>-</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>, consistent with iodine activation and recycling. Modeling shows that observed I<sub>2</sub> levels are able to significantly increase ozone depletion rates, while also producing iodine monoxide (IO) at levels recently observed in the Arctic. These results emphasize the significance of iodine chemistry and the role of snowpack photochemistry in Arctic atmospheric composition, and imply that I<sub>2</sub> is likely a dominant source of iodine atoms in the Arctic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109."}], "LastName": "Raso", "ForeName": "Angela R W", "Initials": "ARW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907."}], "LastName": "Custard", "ForeName": "Kyle D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109."}], "LastName": "May", "ForeName": "Nathaniel W", "Initials": "NW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332."}], "LastName": "Tanner", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352."}], "LastName": "Newburn", "ForeName": "Matt K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352."}], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "Lawrence", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352."}], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "Ronald J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332."}], "LastName": "Huey", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352."}], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "Liz", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Purdue Climate Change Research Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907."}], "LastName": "Shepson", "ForeName": "Paul B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4707-2290"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; prattka@umich.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109."}], "LastName": "Pratt", "ForeName": "Kerri A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Barrie LA, Bottenheim JW, Schnell RC, Crutzen PJ, Rasmussen RA.
