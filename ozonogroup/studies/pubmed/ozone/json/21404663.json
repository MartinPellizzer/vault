Results indicated that the elevated O3 did not change the seasonal pattern of CO2 emissions from soil-winter wheat system, but significantly decreased CO2 emission fluxes during turning-green stage and elongation-pregnant stage. From heading to maturity, CO2 emission fluxes were not found to be significant difference under 100 nL x L(-1) O3 treatment compared with the control, while 150 nL x L(-1) O3 treatment significantly declined CO2 emission fluxes. Significant relationships were found between respiration rate and air temperature under the control, 100 nL x L(-1) and 150 nL x L(-1) O3 treatment, and the fitting equation determined coefficients R2 were 0.139, 0.513 and 0.211, respectively. In addition, the Q10 (temperature sensitivity coefficients) for soil-winter wheat system's respiration were 1.13, 1.58 and 1.21, respectively. The results of this study suggested that elevated O3 could reduce CO2 emissions from agroecosystem."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China. zhhu@nuist.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zheng-Hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cen-Zi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shu-Tao", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Han-Mao", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Shuang-He", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21404663"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
