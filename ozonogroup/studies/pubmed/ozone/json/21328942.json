Two levels of [O3] were installed, i. e., ambient level (CK-O3) and 50% higher than the ambient level (E-O3). With the increase of [O3], the grain protein content of the varieties increased, with the increment being 7.55% - 16.37% (2006 - 2007), 4.93% - 22.63% (2007 - 2008), and 2.29% - 17.65% (2008 - 2009) in the three years, respectively, and the differences between treatments, varieties, and years being all significant. Adversely, the grain protein yield was decreased significantly by 1.83% - 11.64% (2006 - 2007), - 0.41% - 24.22% (2007 - 2008), and -1.90% - 15.81% (2008 - 2009), respectively in the three years. The contents of four grain protein components (albumin, globulin, gliadin, and glutenin) were significantly higher under E-O3 than under CK-O3, and the differences between treatments, varieties, and years were significant, except the albumin and glutenin contents between treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China. xkzhu@yzu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xin-kai", "Initials": "XK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-cheng", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Tao-fang", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Wen-shan", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jian-guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Kazhuhiko", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Globulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-90-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Gliadin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gliadin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Globulins"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21328942"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
