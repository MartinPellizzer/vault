The rate coefficients for the reactions of CaDTPA3- and ZnDTPA3- with ozone were determined to be 6200 and 3500 +/- 150 M-1 s-1, respectively. The reactivity of Fe(III)DTPA2- towards ozone was found to be much lower (< 10 M-1 s-1), but near neutral pH the reactivity of the Fe(III)-complexes is dominated by [Fe(III)(OH)]DTPA3-. For the reaction of Fe[(III)(OH)]DTPA3- with ozone a rate coefficient of 2.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 was measured. The rate coefficients of the reactions of the ZnDTPA- and Fe(III)DTPA with OH radicals have been determined by a competitive method as 2.4 +/- 0.4 x 10(9) and 1.5 +/- 0.1 x 10(9) M-1 s-1, respectively at pH = 7. The degradation of low concentrations of DTPA complexes during ozonation was investigated in natural waters under drinking water relevant conditions. Based on our findings CaDTPA3- and ZnDTPA3- are judged as easily degradable. Fe(III)DTPA complexes showed a somewhat lower reactivity, but were still typically degraded by one order of magnitude at ozone dosages of approximately 20 microM (1 mg L-1) in the three natural waters tested. Molecular ozone was found to be the major oxidant for the metal-DTPA complexes during ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EAWAG, Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology, Uberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stemmler", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glod", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Von Gunten", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7A314HQM0I", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pentetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11337832", "10.1016/s0043-1354(00)00457-7", "S0043-1354(00)00457-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
