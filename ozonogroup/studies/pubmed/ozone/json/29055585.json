Ozone exposure- and flux based response relationships were established for seven physiological variables related to photosynthesis. The performance of the fitting of the regressions in terms of R<sup>2</sup> increased when second order regressions instead of first order ones were used, suggesting that effects of O<sub>3</sub> were more pronounced towards the last developmental stages of the wheat. The more robust indicators were those related with CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, Rubisco activity and RuBP regeneration capacity (A<sub>sat</sub>, J<sub>max</sub> and Vc<sub>max</sub>), and chlorophyll content (Chl). Flux-based metrics (POD<sub>y</sub>, Phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> Dose over a threshold ynmolO<sub>3</sub>m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) predicted slightly better the responses to O<sub>3</sub> than exposure metrics (AOTX, Accumulated O<sub>3</sub> exposure over an hourly Threshold of X ppb) for most of the variables. The best performance was observed for metrics POD<sub>1 (</sub>A<sub>sat</sub>, J<sub>max</sub> and Vc<sub>max</sub>) and POD<sub>3</sub> (Chl). For this crop, the proposed response functions could be used for O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment based on physiological effects and also to include the influence of O<sub>3</sub> on yield or other variables in models with a photosynthetic component."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
