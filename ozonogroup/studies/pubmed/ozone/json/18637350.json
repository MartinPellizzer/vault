The results show that ozonation is an efficient way for treating dichlorvos. The removals of dichlorvos are all over 96% in 5 min ozonation. When ozone concentration is 6.7 mg/L, mineralization rate in TOC reaches 34.8% in 4 min. The degradation rate of dichlorvos increases as the ozone concentration increases but descends as its initial concentration increases. The removal effect of dichlorvos is roughly independent of pH value and temperature. When ozone concentration is 6.7 mg/L at pH 7.2 in room temperature, the ozonation reaction order of dichlorvos is about 0.11 and the reaction rate constant is 7.72 mg x (L x min)(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100083, China. zhg-wei82@mse.buaa.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Zhen-ge", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jie-ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hui", "ForeName": "Jian-hong", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U370BPS14", "NameOfSubstance": "Dichlorvos"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dichlorvos"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18637350"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
