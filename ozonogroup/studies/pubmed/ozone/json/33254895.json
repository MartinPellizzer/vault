However, the effect may be modified by soil nitrogen (N) availability. Numerous studies have focused on the aboveground part of trees under elevated O<sub>3</sub> alone or in combination with soil N; however, little is known about the response of soil bacterial communities. Here, we investigated the effects of O<sub>3</sub> (charcoal-filtered air, CF, versus ambient air +40\u00a0ppb of O<sub>3</sub>, E-O<sub>3</sub>), N addition (0\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, N0, versus 200\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, N200), and their combination on rhizosphere soil bacterial communities of hybrid poplar, using an MiSeq targeted amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. E-O<sub>3</sub> significantly decreased bacterial abundance, and N200 significantly decreased the \u03b1-diversity. The negative impacts of N200 on \u03b1-diversity were alleviated by E-O<sub>3</sub>. Nitrogen and E-O<sub>3</sub>-N200 combination altered bacterial community composition, with a significant increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes. From an ecological network analysis, E-O<sub>3</sub>, alone and in combination with N200, complicated the co-occurrence network of bacterial communities by inducing a microbial survival strategy, shifting the hub species from RB41 to Bacillus and Blastococcus. Conversely, N200 led to simplification and decentralization of the co-occurrence network. These findings demonstrate that the rhizosphere bacterial communities exhibit divergent responses to E-O<sub>3</sub> and N200, suggesting the need to consider the stability of the belowground ecosystem to optimize plantation management in response to environmental changes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
