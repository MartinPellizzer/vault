In fact, expensive care or tooth extraction may be necessary due to the negative effects dental caries have on general health. This is due to its frequent pain and secondary bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of ozonated water as such and in combination with appropriate light radiation so as to perform a photodynamic treatment (PDT) against the cariogenic bacterium <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>.", "This work has been performed in vitro by using an <i>S. mutans</i> strain mainly structured in a biofilm status, reproducing the natural condition of the tooth infection. The ozone was tested at three different concentrations by using a commercial device able to generate different O<sub>3</sub> formulations in water. The PDT treatment requires an appropriate light wavelength, evaluated in this work through the UV-Vis adsorption spectrum of the ozonated water.", "The obtained results suggested an effective and synergic property of O<sub>3</sub> and light at 460-470\u2009nm against this microorganism. The most antibiofilm activity was observed using a concentration of ozone of 0.06\u2009mg/L alone as well as with PDT treatment.", "The results are encouraging for additional research and in vitro/in vivo fresh experimental investigations to perform an exhaustive antimicrobial treatment protocol against the <i>S. mutans</i> tooth infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Oral Biotechnology Laboratory, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International PhD in Innovation Sciences and Technologies (IST), University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy."}], "LastName": "Casu", "ForeName": "Cinzia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Oral Biotechnology Laboratory, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Council of Italy, ISPA- CNR, Sassari, Italy."}], "LastName": "Orr\u00f9", "ForeName": "Germano", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Oral Biotechnology Laboratory, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy."}], "LastName": "Fais", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dental and Maxillofacial Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mazur", "ForeName": "Marta", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dental and Maxillofacial Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Grassi", "ForeName": "Roberta", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dental and Maxillofacial Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Grassi", "ForeName": "Roberto Felice", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dental and Maxillofacial Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Nardi", "ForeName": "Gianna Maria", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Public Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101580775", "ISSNLinking": "2279-9028"}, "CoiStatement": "The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Deepthi R, Bilichodmath S.
