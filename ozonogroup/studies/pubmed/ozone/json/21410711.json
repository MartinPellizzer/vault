We previously identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in rice called OzT8, which was associated with relative dry weight under ozone stress. The photosynthetic response in SL46, a Nipponbare (NB)-Kasalath chromosome segment substitution line (SL) containing the OzT8 locus, was compared to the parent NB in multiple ozone fumigation experiments (100 ppb, 8 h d\u207b\u00b9, 23 d). By day 23, SL46 showed significantly less reduction of photosynthetic capacity compared to NB; the maximum carboxylation rate of ribulose 1\u00b75-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) decreased by 24% in SL46 compared to 49% in NB, and the maximum electron transport rate decreased by 16 and 39%, respectively. The midday carbon assimilation rates also showed a similar trend, but there was no genotypic difference in stomatal conductance. These results indicate that the OzT8 locus confers ozone tolerance via biochemical acclimation, not avoidance, making it a potentially valuable target for breeding of ozone tolerance into future rice lines. The sequence of photosynthetic response of rice to ozone stress and related tolerance factors are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Crop Production and Environment, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Charles P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frei", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wissuwa", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acclimatization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Trait Loci"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21410711", "10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02312.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
