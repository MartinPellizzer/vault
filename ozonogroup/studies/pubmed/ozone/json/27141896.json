The associations between air pollution and biomarkers were analyzed with mixed-effects models, controlling for confounding covariates.", "The concentration of PM2.5, black carbon, NO2 and number concentration of particles with diameter less than 100 nm (PNC100), and particles in size ranges between 100 nm to 200 nm (PNC100-200) during the first follow-up were (156.5\u00b1117.7), (10.7\u00b10.7), (165.9\u00b166.0)\u03bcg/m(3) and 397 521\u00b196 712, 79 421\u00b144 090 per cubic meter, respectively; the concentration were (67.9\u00b129.6), (3.4\u00b11.3), (126.1\u00b110.9) \u03bcg/m(3) and (295 682\u00b139 430), (24 693\u00b112 369) per cubic meter, respectively during the second follow-up.

In our COPD-patient panel, per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PNC100-200, we observed an increase of 65% (95% CI: 8%-152%) in nitrate and nitrite in EBC reflecting airway oxidative stress. For an IQR increase in PM2.5, black carbon and PNC100-200, respective increases of 0.17 ng/ml (95% CI: 0.02-0.33), 0.12 ng/ml (95% CI: 0.01-0.24) and 0.13 ng/ml (95% CI:0.02-0.24) in interleukin-8 in EBC reflecting airway inflammation were also observed. An IQR increase in ozone was also associated with a 0.24 (95%CI: 0.05-0.42) decrease in pH of EBC reflecting increased airway inflammation.
