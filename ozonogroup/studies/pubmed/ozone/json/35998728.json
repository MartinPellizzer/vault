Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) revealed the transformation of heteroatomic DOM containing S, N or both to simpler DOM containing mainly C, H, and O atoms. The decreased N contents in products (N/C\u00a0=\u00a00.0249) compared to precursors (N/C\u00a0=\u00a00.0311) and the higher O/C ratios in the N-containing products suggest the removal of R-NH<sub>2</sub> groups accompanying DOM oxidation. While, S-containing compounds in the products had lower O/C and H/C ratios, suggesting a reduced state and the transformation of R-SO<sub>3</sub> to R-S-R. H-abstraction and OH addition were identified as the primary oxidation mechanisms, thus enhancing the dominance of highly unsaturated and phenolic DOM in the effluent (70.3%) compared to the feed (56.6%). The double bond equivalent (DBE) was also increased by 26% in the effluent compared to the feed and by 33% in products compared to precursors. These findings help understand the DOM transformation in UV/O<sub>3</sub>-assisted ceramic membrane reactors and call for comprehensive toxicity analyses of effluents from the advanced oxidation processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
