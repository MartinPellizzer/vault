The patients were divided into 3 groups based on the therapy instituted: catheter drainage only (group I); catheter drainage and urokinase (group II); catheter drainage, urokinase and ozone (group III). Drainage was considered successful if empyema was resolved with closure of cavity, clinical symptoms were resolved, and need for any further surgical procedure was avoided. Success rate, length of stay (LOS), need for further surgery and hospital costs were compared between the three groups using the Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric test, with <i>P</i> < 0.05 considered significant.", "Of the 209 patients with empyema, all catheters were placed successfully under CT guidance. Sixty-three patients were treated with catheters alone (group I), 64 with catheters and urokinase (group II), and 82 with catheters, urokinase and ozone (group III). Group I, group II and group III had success rates of 62%, 83% and 95% respectively (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Group I and group II had statistically longer LOS (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and higher hospital costs (<i>P</i> < 0.05) compared to group III.
