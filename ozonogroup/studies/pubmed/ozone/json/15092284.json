No effect of ozone was observed on either the development of frost resistance during the hardening phase or on the decrease in frost resistance during the dehardening phase. The preliminary results of Brown et al. (1987) and Barnes and Davidson (1988), which indicated that ozone treatment predisposes plants to winter injury, could thus not be confirmed. Frost resistance was, however, distinctly influenced by the content of the mineral nutrients of the soils. The pronounced K(+) deficiency of the needles of the trees growing on the neutral soil (Alps) had less effect on the development of frost resistance than did the Ca(++) and Mg(++) deficiency of the needles of the trees grown on the acidic soil 1 (Bavarian Forest). The variability of frost resistance between the different clones on soil 1 was partly attributed to fluctuations in the mineral nutrient content of the needles, rather than to a genetic predisposition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botanisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t, D-8000 Munich 19, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Senser", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092284", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90050-m", "0269-7491(90)90050-M"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
