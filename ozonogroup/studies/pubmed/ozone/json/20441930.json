The stibine, generated from samples by borohydride reduction of antimony using flow injection technique, was separated by using a new gas-liquid separator, dried with an ice-salt cryogenic bath and concentrated in a glass U-tube immersed in liquid nitrogen. Re-vaporization of stibine based on its boiling point was achieved by allowing the tube to warm at room temperature. A gas phase chemiluminescence signal was produced during the ozonation of the hydride in a reflective chamber. Under optimal conditions, the proposed method was characterized by a wide linear calibration range from 1.0microgL(-1) to 10.0mgL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.18microgL(-1) (n=11). The relative standard deviation for 10.0microgL(-1) antimony was 3.56% (n=11) and the sampling rate was 15 samples h(-1). Blank signal was reduced by the purification of reagents and the interference from transition metal ions was eliminated by the addition of L-cysteine into samples. The method was applied to the determination of antimony in environmental samples with satisfactory results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yousheng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sang", "ForeName": "Jianchi", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hongbing", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Guanhong", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Talanta", "NlmUniqueID": "2984816R", "ISSNLinking": "0039-9140"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ice"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0VKZ97K3UB", "NameOfSubstance": "stibine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IT35J3UV3", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimony"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antimony"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freezing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20441930", "10.1016/j.talanta.2010.02.060", "S0039-9140(10)00175-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
