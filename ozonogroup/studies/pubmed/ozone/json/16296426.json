Gaseous ozone (HealOzone) was applied once for 40 seconds to the randomly assigned test molar of each pair without the use of remineralizing solutions. Lesion progression or reversal was monitored by the laser fluorescence system DIAGNOdent for up to 3 months and the deterioration or improvement compared between the ozone-treated lesions and the untreated control lesions (in pairs). This was done for the whole study population and a subgroup of patients with high current caries risk (lesion pairs n=26).", "After 3 months, explorative data analysis revealed that the ozone-treated lesions showed significantly more caries reversal or reduced caries progression than the untreated control lesions within the group of patients at high current caries risk (Wilcoxon-Test, P= 0.035). There was no statistical significance examining the whole study population. From the data it can be concluded that ozone application significantly improved non-cavitated initial fissure caries in patients at high caries risk over a 3-month period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry and Periodontology, Dental School, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Goethe Street 70, D-80336 Munich, Germany. khuth@dent.med.uni-muenchen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huth", "ForeName": "Karin Christine", "Initials": "KC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paschos", "ForeName": "Ekaterini", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brand", "ForeName": "Korbinian", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hickel", "ForeName": "Reinhard", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8806701", "ISSNLinking": "0894-8275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DMF Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries Activity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Fissures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16296426"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
