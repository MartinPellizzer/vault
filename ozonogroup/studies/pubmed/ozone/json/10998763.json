This article examines the association of outdoor air pollutant concentrations and air spora with the decrease in lung function (measured by morning peak expiratory flow) of two groups of asthmatic subjects in the subtropical environment of South East Queensland, Australia. Lung function responses were stratified by age, allergy status, and location, and seasonal effects were examined. Allergy status and age were found to be important, with air pollutants such as ozone and particles associated with decreases in lung function in allergic individuals older than 15 years. Fungal spore counts were strongly associated with a decrease in lung function in allergic adults, especially in those over 54 years, only in seasons when these air spora peak. Analysis for the entire study period indicates that the effect of ozone on peak expiratory flow in the allergic group can sometimes be confounded by air spora effects, indicating that in a subtropical climate the impact of ozone on asthma severity can be accurately estimated only when the confounding effects of air spora are included."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Griffith University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. s.rutherford@mailbox.gu.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rutherford", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simpson", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCall", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9504688", "ISSNLinking": "1076-2752"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Queensland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10998763", "10.1097/00043764-200009000-00006"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
