To promote the chemical reactions between O<sub>3</sub> and target pollutants, here we developed a novel gas-solid-liquid reaction interface dominated triphase ozonation system using a functional hydrophobic membrane with an adsorption layer as the O<sub>3</sub> distributor and place where chemical reactions occurred. In the triphase system, the functional hydrophobic membrane simultaneously improved the interface adsorption performance of emerging pollutants and the access pathway of O<sub>3</sub>, leading to a marked enhancement of interfacial pollutant concentration and O<sub>3</sub> levels. These synergistic qualities result in high ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal efficiency (94.39%) and fast apparent reaction rate constant (<i>k</i><sub>app</sub>, 2.75 \u00d7 10<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) versus a traditional O<sub>3</sub> process (41.82% and 0.48 \u00d7 10<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). In addition, this triphase system was an advanced oxidation process involving radical participation and showed excellent degradation performance of multiple emerging pollutants. Our findings highlight the importance of gas-solid-liquid triphase reaction interface design and provide new insight into the efficient removal of emerging pollutants by the ozonation process."]},
