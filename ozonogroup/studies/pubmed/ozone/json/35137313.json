It was found that the CPO surface contained active type c water, which was generally adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy. The test of oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O<sub>2</sub>-TPD) showed that the surface of CPO was rich in oxygen vacancy. Through the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) detection, a pair of Co valence redox peaks were detected from the CV curves, and the results of XPS test showed the replacement of octahedral Co<sup>3+</sup> with Fe<sup>3 +</sup> in the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> during preparation of CPO. The enriched oxygen vacancy could be used as active sites for ozone adsorption and improve the charge transfer capacity. The number of hydroxyl radicals was detected by electron spin resonance (EPR) and it indicated that CPO contained more hydroxyl radicals, so it had higher effect in catalytic ozonation for organic pollutant degradation. In this paper, the relationship between oxygen vacancy and reactive center in the microstructure of the catalysts was established to discuss their working mechanism. The influence of the initial pH value, catalyst dosage, and ozone concentration on the removal of NaTSA was investigated by response surface design, and the optimal experimental conditions were predicted and verified."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
