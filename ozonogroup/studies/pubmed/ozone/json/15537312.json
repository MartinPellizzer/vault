To eliminate problems associated with raw material inhomogeneity, processing was conducted on a pilot-plant scale under operating conditions of industrial practice. Inherent product heterogeneity caused by diverse lettuce leaf tissues was compensated for by pooling large-sized samples, and frequent sampling ensured significant data about the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POD), as well as the contents of caffeic acid derivatives over storage time. In the homogeneous lettuce samples, specific responses caused by different washing procedures were detectable. PAL activity in the samples increased for up to 5-8 days of storage. Compared to tap and ozonated water, the use of chlorinated water (100-200 mg/L free chlorine) for washing trimmed heads or shredded lettuce significantly reduced PAL activity and the concomitant rise of 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (isochlorogenic acid isomer) concentrations. The phenolic acids O-caffeoyltartaric (caftaric acid), di-O-caffeoyltartaric (chicoric acid), 5-O-caffeoylquinic (chlorogenic acid isomer), and O-caffeoylmalic were less influenced by different washing treatments. Individual contents either were constant or decreased during storage. Additionally, the novel finding of a further caffeic acid isomer, tentatively identified as meso-di-O-caffeoyltartaric acid, is reported. PPO and POD activities were less affected by different washing treatments and thus were less suitable physiological indicators of stress reactions triggered by alternative processing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section Plant Foodstuff Technology, Institute of Food Technology, Hohenheim University, August-von-Hartmann-Strasse 3, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baur", "ForeName": "Sascha", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klaiber", "ForeName": "Ralph G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koblo", "ForeName": "Arjuna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carle", "ForeName": "Reinhold", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.10.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechol Oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catechol Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15537312", "10.1021/jf048961a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
