The threat of vCJD and the difficulty in removing prion protein has provided a new challenge for cleaning surgical and dental instruments. Prion proteins are also more resistant to many disinfection and sterilisation techniques. A number of different methods are currently available in primary care for cleaning instruments including manual washing, ultrasonic cleaners and washer disinfectors. Manual cleaning of dental instruments is time-consuming, introduces operator error and the risk of puncture wounds, is not reproducible and does not completely remove debris from instruments. Ultrasonic baths are significantly more effective than hand cleaning alone and are currently used by the majority of dental surgeries (often as an adjunct to manual cleaning). Automated washer-disinfectors appear to provide a validated, reliable and reproducible procedure for disinfection and sterilisation of dental instruments to ensure both the safety of patients and dental staff. Dental instruments that are difficult to clean are frequently contaminated with tissue debris after routine reprocessing and cannot be excluded as a potential transmission risk for infectious agents, including prions. The transmission of vCJD via dentistry is considered to be low risk, however, the Department of Health (DoH) has recently advised dentists to ensure that endodontic reamers and files are treated as single-use as a precautionary basis in order to further reduce any risk of vCJD transmission."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HPA Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Porton Down, Salisbury, SP4 0JG. jimmy.walker@hpa.org.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dickinson", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sutton", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raven", "ForeName": "N D H", "Initials": "ND"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marsh", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Dent J", "NlmUniqueID": "7513219", "ISSNLinking": "0007-0610"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Br Dent J. 2007 Dec 22;203(12):669. doi: 10.1038/bdj.2007.1122", "PMID": "18084199"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Decontamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Instruments"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Reuse"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Infection Control, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Prions"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonic Therapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17934424", "10.1038/bdj.2007.893", "bdj.2007.893"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
