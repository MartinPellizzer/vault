All chemical pollution forms together may be responsible for up to 12 million annual excess deaths as estimated by the Lancet Commission on pollution and health as well as the World Health Organization. Ambient air pollution by particulate matter (PM) and ozone was found to be associated with an all-cause mortality rate of up to 9 million in the year 2015, with the majority being of cerebro- and cardiovascular nature (e.g. stroke and ischemic heart disease). Recent evidence suggests that exposure to airborne particles and gases contributes to and accelerates neurodegenerative diseases. Especially, airborne toxic particles contribute to these adverse health effects. Whereas it is well established that air pollution in the form of PM may lead to dysregulation of neurohormonal stress pathways and may trigger inflammation as well as oxidative stress, leading to secondary damage of cardiovascular structures, the mechanistic impact of PM-induced mitochondrial damage and dysfunction is not well established. With the present review we will discuss similarities between mitochondrial damage and dysfunction observed in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration as well as those adverse mitochondrial pathomechanisms induced by airborne PM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
