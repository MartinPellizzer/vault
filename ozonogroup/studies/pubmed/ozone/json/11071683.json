A total of 142 male patients with pathologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma, 1900 controls with cancer at other sites and 533 population-based controls were interviewed. Detailed job histories and relevant data on potential confounders were obtained. A group of chemists-hygienists evaluated each job reported and translated them into a history of occupational exposures using a checklist of 294 substances. Multivariate logistic regression models using either population, cancer controls, or a pool of both groups were used to estimate odds ratios.", "There were some indications of excess risks among printers, nursery workers (gardening), aircraft mechanics, farmers, and horticulturists, as well as in the following industries: printing-related services, defense services, wholesale trade, and retail trade. Notwithstanding the low precision of many of the odds ratio estimates, the following workplace exposures showed some evidence of excess risk: chromium compounds, chromium (VI) compounds, inorganic acid solutions, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, hydrogen sulphide, ultraviolet radiation, hair dust, felt dust, jet fuel engine emissions, jet fuel, aviation gasoline, phosphoric acid and inks.", "For most of these associations there exist no, or very little, previous data.
