Biocompatibility of the raw (untreated) and ozonated dye hydrolysates was comparatively tracked through specific oxygen uptake rate measurements from which the respirometric inhibition of biological activated sludge imparted by raw and ozonated reactive dye wastewater with respect to synthetic domestic wastewater was determined. It could be demonstrated that preliminary ozonation of reactive azo dyes increases their biological compatibility more significantly than formazan copper complex, copper complex azo and phythalocyanine dyes as a consequence of heavy metal release associated with the cleavage of associated chromophoric groupings right at the initial stages of pre-ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Civil Engineering, Department of Environmental Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, 34469 Maslak, Turkey. arslanid@itu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arslan-Alaton", "ForeName": "Idil", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12697172", "10.1016/S0045-6535(03)00231-5", "S0045-6535(03)00231-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
