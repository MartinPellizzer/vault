The research involves the development of a three-tier multiple-choice diagnostic test entitled the Atmospheric Pollution Phenomena Diagnostic Test (APPDiT). APPDiT is a 15-item diagnostic test comprising items for assessing students' understanding and self-confidence of atmospheric pollution problems. The results reveal that the majority of the participants demonstrated a lack of knowledge or misconception about atmosphere pollution since the overall success rate on the APPDiT was 39.6%. In particular, only 36.7%, 5.1%, 42.7% or 19.1% of the students have adequate knowledge regarding understanding of the formation, consequences, and strategies to reduce acid rain, global warming, ozone layer depletion and photochemical smog, respectively. This shows a substantial students' knowledge deficits related to atmosphere pollution at the end of the compulsory education in Slovenia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Majer", "ForeName": "Janja", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slapni\u010dar", "ForeName": "Miha", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devetak", "ForeName": "Iztok", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Slovenia", "MedlineTA": "Acta Chim Slov", "NlmUniqueID": "101247110", "ISSNLinking": "1318-0207"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "36"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33855528", "Majer-2019-3"]}}]}
