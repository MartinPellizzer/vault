Conventional treatment modalities are often of limited success in promoting complete wound closure. The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of noninvasive ozone-oxygen therapy in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.", "Diabetes patients with a Wagner classification stage 2 or 3 ulcer or a stage 4 ulcer after debridement of at least 8 weeks in duration were included in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients received conventional treatment in combination with either ozone-oxygen treatment or sham treatments for 12 weeks, and after an additional 12 weeks, wound status was re-examined.", "In total, 61 patients (62% male, 62.6\u00b19.8 years old) participated in the study; 32 were randomized to ozone treatment, and 29 to placebo. The proportion of subjects with full wound closure did not differ significantly by treatment assignment (41% vs. 33%, P=0.34). Among the 34 subjects who completed the study per protocol (PP) (16 in the ozone group, 18 in the placebo group), a significantly higher rate of complete wound closure was observed in the ozone group (81% vs. 44%, P=0.03). Among PP patients with wound size \u22645\u2009cm(2), the rate of total wound closure was 100% versus 50% in the sham treatment group (P=0.006). A nonsignificant, 55.5% relative increase in healed wound area was detected in the ozone group versus the placebo group (4.2\u00b14.9\u2009cm(2) vs. 2.7\u00b11.5\u2009cm(2), P=0.23).", "Among PP patients, ozone treatment in addition to conventional treatment was superior to conventional treatment alone in promoting the complete healing of diabetic foot ulcers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diabetes Research Unit, E.
