However, the strong oxidative reactivity of active chlorine can cause adverse effects on both human health and the environment. In this study, aerosolized Oxone\u00ae [2KHSO\u2085, KHSO\u2084, K\u2082SO\u2084] with saline solution has been utilized to produce active chlorine (HOCl and Cl\u2082). To investigate the impact of active chlorine on volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation, 2-methyl-2-butene (MB) was photoirradiated in the presence of active chlorine using a 2-m\u00b3 Teflon film indoor chamber. The resulting carbonyl products produced from photooxidation of MB were derivatized with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxyamine hydrochloride (PFBHA) and analyzed using gas chromatograph-ion trap mass spectrometer (GC/ITMS). The photooxidation of MB in the presence of active chlorine was simulated with an explicit kinetic model using a chemical solver (Morpho) which included both Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) and Cl radical reactions. The reaction rate constants of a Cl radical with MB and its oxidized products were estimated using a Structure-Reactivity Relationship method. Under dark conditions no effect of active chlorine on MB oxidation was apparent, whereas under simulated daylight conditions (UV irradiation) rapid MB oxidation was observed due to photo-dissociation of active chlorine. The model simulation agrees with chamber data showing rapid production of oxygenated products that are characterized using GC/ITMS. Ozone formation was enhanced when MB was oxidized in the presence of irradiated active chlorine and NO(x)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences, University of Florida, P.O.
