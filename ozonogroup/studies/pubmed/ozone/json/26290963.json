They are readily produced photolytically upon irradiation of some stable Cl containing species, for instance, nitrosyl chloride, ClNO. We predict the formation of ClNO using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of an NO2 dimer on the surface of a thin film of water upon which gaseous HCl impinges. The reactant is chloride ion formed when HCl ionizes on the water film. The same mechanism for ClNO production may occur in humid environments when ONONO2 (the asymmetric NO2 dimer examined here) comes in contact with either HCl or sea salt. The film of water serves to (1) stabilize ONONO2 on the film surface so that it is localized and physically accessible for reaction, (2) provide the medium to ionize HCl, and (3) activate ONONO2 making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by chloride. This substitution/elimination mechanism is new for NOx chemistry on thin water films and could not be derived from studies on small clusters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hammerich", "ForeName": "Audrey Dell", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Department of Chemistry, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finlayson-Pitts", "ForeName": "Barbara J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Department of Chemistry, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7Institute of Chemistry and the Fritz Haber Research Center, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904 Israel."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2225Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, P.O.
