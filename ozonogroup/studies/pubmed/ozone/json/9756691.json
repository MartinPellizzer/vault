A scenario for ozone damage of conifers is now derived from the first exposure experiments in which both the initial biochemical response phase and delayed visible symptom development were studied. A number of early biochemical ozone responses could be detected in Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The stress metabolite catechin persisted over several months. In the year following ozone treatment of spruce, decreases in pigment content and photosynthetic capacity, as well as development of visible symptoms (chlorosis, banding), were determined in the needle age classes previously exposed to an accumulated hourly ozone dose above 40 ppb (AOT40) of >/=60-80 ppm small middle doth. The visible symptoms developed during spring emergence of the new flush. In the case of Scots pine, an ozone dose (AOT40) of >/=30 ppm small middle doth caused the premature shedding of needles 9 months after treatment. The delayed symptoms of both spruce and pine occurred during known phases of endogenous stress. The symptoms appeared to reflect an ozone \"memory\" imprinted by the induced early stress reactions. Ambient AOT40 ozone doses in Central Europe are in the range 4 and 50 ppm small middle doth per growing season. Ozone is proposed to potentially damage conifers through memory effects (\"abiotic\" pathway) or through predisposition for pathogen attack (\"biotic\" pathway)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1998 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Biochemische Pflanzenpathologie, Arbeitsgruppe Expositionskammern, GSF Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr Umwelt und Gesundheit GmbH, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstrasse 1, Oberschleissheim, D-85764, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Langebartels", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heller", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "F\u00fchrer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lippert", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simons", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandermann", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9756691", "10.1006/eesa.1998.1668", "S0147-6513(98)91668-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
