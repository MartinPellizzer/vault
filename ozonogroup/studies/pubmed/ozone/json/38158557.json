Canonical transition state theory has been used to calculate the rate coefficients of individual steps for the formation of POZ. The calculated rate coefficients for 1,3-cycloaddition of ozone at the (i) unsaturated C(OH)\u2550C(OH) bond and (ii) CH\u2550C(OH) of catechol, respectively, are in good agreement with the experimental rate constant. In general, subsequent decomposition of POZ leads to well-known Criegee Intermediates. This work reveals a parallel pathway by which the <i>endo</i>-addition of ozone at CH\u2550C(OH) of catechol proceeds through oxepin derivatives along with the paths leading to Criegee Intermediates and peroxy acids. The 7-membered heterocyclic oxepin derivatives have lower energies than Criegee Intermediates but similar relative energies with peroxy acids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong 793022, India."}], "LastName": "Rynjah", "ForeName": "Shankupar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong 793022, India."}], "LastName": "Baro", "ForeName": "Bhabesh", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2640-4401"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong 793022, India."}], "LastName": "Sarkar", "ForeName": "Biplab", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38158557", "10.1021/acs.jpca.3c04582"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
