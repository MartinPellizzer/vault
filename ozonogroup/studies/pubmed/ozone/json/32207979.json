In addition to this, the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the title reactions were theoretically investigated using CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory in the temperature range of 200-400 K using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) in combination with small curvature tunneling (SCT) method. The rate coefficients at (298 \u00b1 2) K were measured to be <i>k</i><sub>E2MP+OH</sub> = (2.71 \u00b1 0.79) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and <i>k</i><sub>E22DMP+OH</sub> = (2.58 \u00b1 0.80) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The degradation mechanisms for the title reactions were investigated in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography with infrared spectroscopy (GC-IR). From the recognized products, the possible product degradation mechanisms were predicted. In addition to this, the atmospheric lifetimes (ALs), lifetime-corrected radiative forcing (RF), global warming potential (GWPs) and photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCPs) were calculated to further understand the environmental impact of these molecules on the Earth's troposphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai-600036, India."}], "LastName": "Kaipara", "ForeName": "Revathy", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3344-5159"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai-600036, India."}], "LastName": "Rajakumar", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32207979", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c00903"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
