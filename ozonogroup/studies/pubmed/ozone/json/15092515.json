This evidence has provided the foundation of the ozone-acid mist hypothesis of spruce decline. We report experiments with Norway spruce saplings fumigated with purified and unpurified O(3). The results show that the accumulation of NO(3)(-) in the needles arises from the rapid deposition of N(2)O(5) and HNO(3) formed from N(2) in the ozonator. An increase in removal of NH(4)(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) from the needles during soaking in H(2)SO(4), pH3, was also observed, which was related to the increase in NO(3)(-) but was independent of O(3) concentration. It is concluded that results of previous experiments cited in support of the ozone-acid mist hypothesis arose from effects which were at least partly caused by N(2)O(5) produced as a contaminant, and were incorrectly attributed to ozone. Other effects, such as growth stimulations, visible symptons, enhanced frost sensitivity, and infestation by pests or pathogens, which have been attributed to O(3) generated by electric discharge in air, should be interpreted with caution. Future experiments with ozone must eliminate this problem by either using O(2)-driven ozonators, or by purifying the output from air-driven ozonators using cold and/or water traps."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CEGB, Central Electricity Research Laboratories, Kelvin Avenue, Leatherhead KT22 7SE, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roberts", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092515", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90159-5", "0269749188901595"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
