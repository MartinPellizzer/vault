To better understand the processes that might contribute to the increased pulmonary inflammatory response to ozone in hyperthyroidism, we evaluated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of selected cytokines in control and hyperthyroid rats after exposure to air or ozone. In addition, we assessed whether there is a relative increase in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) binding activity in cells harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage from hyperthyroid rats following the inhalation of ozone. A hyperthyroid condition was induced by the administration of thyroxine (0.5 mg/kg body weight) for 7 days. Control rats received vehicle injections. The animals were then exposed by inhalation to air or ozone (2 ppm for 3 h) and studied 18 h following the exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage levels of MIP-2 and MCP-1 were increased in both control and hyperthyroid rats by ozone exposure. However, the increases in hyperthyroid rats were much greater, MIP-2 1.5-fold and MCP-1 11-fold, when compared to levels in controls following ozone. These changes appeared to be relatively specific; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-4, and IL-10 were generally low or nondetectable across all of the studied groups at the 18-h postexposure time point. We also found that NF-kappaB binding activity was increased at both 4 and 18 h following ozone exposure in bronchoalveolar lavage cell extracts from hyperthyroid rats relative to the activity in control samples. Collectively, these results suggest that mechanisms contributing to the enhanced pulmonary inflammatory response to ozone in a hyperthyroid state include an increase in NF-kappaB activation and an upregulation of chemokine production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia 26505, USA. ljh3@cdc.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huffman", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prugh", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brumbaugh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokine CCL2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokine CXCL2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokines, CXC"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cxcl2 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q51BO43MG4", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Chemokine CCL2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemokine CXCL2"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Chemokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemokines, CXC"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperthyroidism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases, Interstitial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Monokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroxine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12454797", "10.1080/08958370290084845"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
