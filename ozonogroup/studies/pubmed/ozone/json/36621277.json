The study demonstrated that the C-N-Mn and C-O-Mn bonds constructed in the catalyst linking MnO and CN created the synergistic effects which could overcome typical problems, such as metal leaching etc. The C-N-Mn and C-O-Mn bonds could promote electron transfer from cation-\u03c0 reactions to form electron-rich Mn(II) sites and electron-poor CN sites. The electron-rich Mn(II) sites as active sites supplied electrons to ozone which then further evolved into reactive oxygen species (ROS). The electron-poor CN sites captured electrons from the pollutant intermediate radicals to electron-rich Mn(II) sites via cation-\u03c0 reactions with the help of C-N-Mn and C-O-Mn bonds, which promote the redox reactions of Mn. The surface hydroxyl groups also participated in ozone decomposition and ROS production. Additionally, <sup>\u2022</sup>OH was the dominant ROS of the Mn-nCN HCO processes. This study presents the excellent HCO performance of Mn-nCN, as well as provides views on the electron transfer route between the catalyst, pollutant and ozone, which is crucial for the design of the catalyst."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
