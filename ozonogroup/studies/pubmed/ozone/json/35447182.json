However, it is necessary to improve the problem of easy loss, difficult recovery, and low percentage of gaseous products. Here, MgO, amorphous Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were selected as doping components and supports, respectively, to prepare \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@Fe/Mg composite catalysts with abundant acidic-basic sites and oxygen vacancies. The results show that \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@Fe/Mg<sub>5</sub> can efficiently catalyze the ozonation of ammonium nitrogen (98.73%) with 67.82% gaseous product selectivity under the conditions of initial pH = 7, catalyst dosage of 112.88 g/L, and ozone dosage of 2.4 mg/min. The doping of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MgO with a weaker lattice oxygen binding energy improves the gaseous product selectivity. The mechanism of ammonium nitrogen removal for \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@Fe/Mg<sub>5</sub> is revealed, especially the intrinsic contribution of acidic-basic sites and oxygen vacancies. The pH and active sites play different roles in ozone decomposition for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> removal. Surface hydroxyl protonation on basic sites and oxygen vacancies and electron transfer on acidic sites are responsible for ozone decomposition to hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@Fe/Mg<sub>5</sub> exhibits good stability, few leaching ions, and can be settled in water for easy recovery. This study suggests that \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@Fe/Mg<sub>5</sub> is a good candidate for the catalytic ozonation of ammonium nitrogen."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
