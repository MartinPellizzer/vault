Therefore, we aimed to examine how environmental parameters change the body physiology in a hot environment during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.", "This was a retrospective cohort study extracted from the MEDIC Japan heatstroke prevention database, which was recorded between 1 August and 7 September, 2020. Its database is a registry collection from seven healthy health-care providers. Subjects recorded their own vital signs (forehead and tympanic temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation) and environmental factors (type of weather, wet-bulb globe temperature [WBGT],\u2009air temperature, humidity, and location) every hour during their working shift.", "From 323 records, a weak positive but statistically significant correlation was observed between WBGT and pulse rate (correlation coefficient [95% confidence interval], <i>r</i>\u2009=\u20090.34 [0.23, 0.45]) and between WBGT and core body temperature. Forehead temperature had a stronger correlation than tympanic temperature (forehead, <i>r</i>\u2009=\u20090.33 [0.21, 0.43]; tympanic, <i>r</i>\u2009=\u20090.17 [0.05, 0.28]), which also showed a larger effect (forehead, \u03b7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.08; tympanic, \u03b7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.05). The effect size of oxygen saturation measured outdoors was large (\u03b7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.30). Forehead temperature increased abruptly at 28\u00b0C WBGT and at 33\u00b0C air temperature.", "A hot environment significantly affected forehead temperature, and the daytime imposed a high risk of heatstroke. To avoid heatstroke, environmental parameters are important to note as outdoor environments had a large effect on vital sign changes depending on the time of day."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 The Authors.
