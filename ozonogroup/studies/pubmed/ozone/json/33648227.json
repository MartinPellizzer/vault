The transcriptomes of cantaloupe peel and pulp in response to ozone treatment were investigated to reveal the mechanisms using a high-throughput RNA sequencing approach. Results showed that 570 and 313 differentially expressed genes were identified in peel and pulp, respectively. According to these identified genes, the gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the ozone treatment could maintain the firmness of the cantaloupe by changing pectin metabolites and reduction of the ethylene production by regulating relevant genes especially in the peel. The total flavonoid content changes in peel and pulp related to the regulation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase and P450 family genes which further leading to the inhibition of phenylalanine metabolic pathway in peel but promotion of secondary metabolism in pulp. The qRT-PCR results were in accordance with our RNA sequencing results which validated the conclusions. The present study for the first time reveals the mechanism of cantaloupe in response to ozone treatment at a transcriptome level which is of importance for cantaloupe storage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
