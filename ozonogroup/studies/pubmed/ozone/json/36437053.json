However, research has been relatively independent on specific groups of pollutants due to the limitation of the discipline. In this study, from the perspective of interdisciplinary research, taking the fluorochemical industry as an example, two major categories of emerging pollutants, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and ozone-depleting substances (ODS), were discussed regarding their co-emission. The co-production mechanism of the two types of pollutants were discussed from the production processes to reveal their internal relationship; their differences and cross-processes in the emission routes were analyzed, as well as the technical approaches and challenges required in sample collection, pretreatment, and instrumental analysis. The eco-environmental effects, including ecological and human health risks, ozone depletion, and global warming effects caused by the two types of pollutants in different media were comprehensively summarized. We also further expanded the perspectives of stakeholder analysis, life cycle analysis, and mass balance analysis to provide suggestions for further research and management of emerging pollutant co-emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Coastal and Wetland Ecosystems, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory for Coastal Ecology and Environmental Studies, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Pei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xin-Yi", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhao-Yang", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Coastal and Wetland Ecosystems, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory for Coastal Ecology and Environmental Studies, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China."}], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Yong-Long", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urbanization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36437053", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205344"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
