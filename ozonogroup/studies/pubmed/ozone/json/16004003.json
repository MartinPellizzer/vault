The organic wastewater from the TFT-LCD industry was selected as the target. MBR, RO and ozone plants were established for evaluation. An MBR plant consisted of a 2-stage anoxic/aerobic bioreactor and an immersed UF membrane unit was employed. The effluent of MBR was conducted into the RO system then into the ozone system. The RO system consisted of a spiral membrane in the vessel. One bubble column, 75 cm high and diameter 5 cm, were used as the ozonation reactor. On the bottom of ozonation reactor is a porous diffuser for releasing gas, with an aperture of 100 microm (0.1 cm). Over the whole experimental period, the MBR process achieved a satisfactory organic removal. The COD could be removed with an average of over 98.5%. For the TOC item, the average removal efficiency was 97.4%. The stable effluent quality and satisfactory removal performance were ensured by the efficient interception performance of an immersed UF membrane device incorporated with the biological reactor. Moreover, the MBR effluent did not contain any suspended solids and the SDI value was under 3. After the treatment of RO, excellent water quality was found. The water quality of permeate was under 5 mg/I, 2 mg/l and 50 micros/cm for COD, TOC and conductivity respectively. The treated water can be recycled and reused for the cooling tower make-up water or other purposes. After the treatment of ozone, the treated water quality was under 5 mg/l and 0.852 mg/l for COD and TOC respectively. The test results of MBR, MBR/RO and MBR/RO/ozone processes were compared as possible appropriate treatment technologies applied in TFT-LCD industrial wastewater reuse and recycling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Environmental Technology Co., Ltd., 4F, 100, Sec.2, Pan-Chiao City, Taipei County, Chinese Taiwan. tkchen.ev88g@nctu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electronics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16004003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
