In each community, air pollution data were collected. Spirometry was performed twice a year. PM10 concentration (mean concentration between two subsequent lung-function measures in spring and autumn (summer interval) or between autumn and spring (winter interval)) showed a mean value of 17.36 microg x m(-3) in the summer interval and 21.03 microg m(-3) in the winter interval. A slower increase in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and midexpiratory flow between 25 and 75% of the forced vital capacity (MEF25-75) with age in children exposed to higher summer PM10 was observed in the 3-yr study period. After adjusting for potential confounders (sex, atopy, passive smoking, initial height, height difference, site, initial lung function) an increase of summer PM10 by 10 microg x m(-3) was associated with a decrease in FEV1 growth of 84 mL x yr(-1) and 329 mL x s(-1) x yr(-1) for MEF25-75. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone also showed a negative effect on lung-function growth, confirming previous work. The authors concluded that long-term exposure to particulate matter <10 microm in diameter had a significant negative effect on lung-function proxy for the development of large (forced expiratory volume in one second) and small (midexpiratory flow between 25 and 75% of the forced vital capacity) airways, respectively, with strong evidence for a further effect of ozone and nitrogen dioxide on the development of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horak", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Studnicka", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gartner", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spengler", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tauber", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urbanek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veiter", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frischer", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Eur Respir J. 2002 Nov;20(5):1354-5; author reply 1355. doi: 10.1183/09031936.00.00042802", "PMID": "12449193"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Austria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12030722", "10.1183/09031936.02.00512001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
