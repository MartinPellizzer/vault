Thirty-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control: administered only with anesthesia, rats were not subjected to torsion-detorsion; I/R: subjected to torsion and subsequent detorsion, without administering any treatment agent; and I/R + EA, I/R + O and I/R + O + EA: subjected to torsion and detorsion processes and administered with EA, O or EA + O at the 75th minute of torsion. The rats were then sacrificed under general anesthesia and the ovarian tissues were excised. The tissues were homogenized and levels of glutathione reductase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde (MDA) were analyzed. Tissue damage was evaluated in terms of histopathological parameters, such as hemorrhage, congestion, edema and inflammation.", "Antioxidant enzyme activity and MDA levels in the ovary tissue increased in the I/R group and decreased in the O, EA and O + EA groups (P < 0.05). Histopathological examination revealed that tissue damage in the O, EA and O + EA groups decreased in comparison with the I/R group (P < 0.05).", "These biochemical and histopathological findings suggest that EA and O are effective against ovarian I/R injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Erzincan University, Erzincan."}], "LastName": "Sayar", "ForeName": "Ilyas", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Child Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Erzincan University, Erzincan."}], "LastName": "Bicer", "ForeName": "Senol", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Erzincan University, Erzincan."}], "LastName": "Gursul", "ForeName": "Cebrail", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Erzincan University, Erzincan."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcrb\u00fczel", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Erzincan University, Erzincan."}], "LastName": "Peker", "ForeName": "Kemal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Erzincan University, Erzincan."}], "LastName": "I\u015fik", "ForeName": "Arda", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "J Obstet Gynaecol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9612761", "ISSNLinking": "1341-8076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19YRN3ZS9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovary"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Torsion Abnormality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26555146", "10.1111/jog.12858"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
