The decrease in O<sub>3</sub> concentration during 2020 to 2022 followed the synergistical declines in HCHO columns and tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> columns. \u2462 The O<sub>3</sub> weekend effects were reversed in Linfen and Yuncheng but were persistent in the other nine cities. Satellite-based weekend HCHO and NO<sub>2</sub> levels were higher than those on weekdays in some cities of Shanxi Province\uff0cindicating that the O<sub>3</sub> weekend effect was not only dependent on the changes of precursors emissions but was also closely related to O<sub>3</sub> photochemical production sensitivity.
