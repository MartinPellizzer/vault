Its concentration in the atmosphere has been rapidly increasing since the green revolution in the 1950s and 1960s. Riverine systems have been suggested to be an important source of N<sub>2</sub>O, although their quantitative contribution has been estimated with poor precision, ranging between 32.2 and 2100 GgN<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0-\u00a0N/yr. Here, we quantify reach scale N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by integrating a data-driven machine learning model with a physically-based upscaling model. The application of this hybrid modeling approach reveals that small streams (those with widths less than 10\u00a0m) are the primary sources of riverine N<sub>2</sub>O emissions to the atmosphere. They contribute nearly 36 GgN<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0-\u00a0N/yr; almost 50% of the entire N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from riverine systems (72.8 Gg<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0-\u00a0N/yr), although they account for only 13% of the total riverine surface area worldwide. Large rivers (widths wider than 175\u00a0m), such as the main stems of the Amazon River (~ 6 GgN<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0-\u00a0N/yr), the Mississippi River (~ 2 GgN<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0-\u00a0N/yr), the Congo River (~ 1 GgN<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0-\u00a0N/yr) and the Yang Tze River (~ 0.7 GgN<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0-\u00a0N/yr), only contribute 26% of global N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, which primarily originate from their water column. This study identifies, for the first time, near-global N<sub>2</sub>O emission and NO<sub>3</sub> removal hot spots within watersheds and thus can aid the development of local- to global-scale management and mitigation strategies for riverine systems with respect to N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. The presented framework can be extended to quantified biogeochemical, besides N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, processes at the global scale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
