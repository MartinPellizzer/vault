A 14-channel spectrophotometer with a sampling rate of 10 Hz was added, and the modified instrument, AMON-RA, performed successful measurements of the setting star Alnilam during the third European Stratospheric Experiment on Ozone (THESEO) project. Unambiguous records of the chromatic scintillation were obtained, to our knowledge for the first time from above the atmosphere, and some of its basic properties are reported. The properties of atmospheric structures that are responsible for this chromatic scintillation were found to be consistent with those of previous monochromatic measurements performed from space. A maximum chromatic delay of 2.5 s was observed for widely different wavelengths."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Renard", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalaudier", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hauchecorne", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robert", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lemaire", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pirre", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bertaux", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18360463", "10.1364/ao.40.004254", "65071"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
