The concentration of ozone was 40-50 \u00b5g/ml in the disc/protruded nucleus pulposus and 30 \u00b5g/ml in the lateral recess (around the nerve root).", "The treatment procedures were successfully completed in all the 262 patients. The average scores of JOA and VAS before treatment were 8.30\u22131.4 and 8.73\u22130.8, and changed significantly to 24.16\u22133.2 (P=0.0158) and 2.41\u22130.2 (P=0.0242) after treatment, respectively. According to the modified MacNab criteria, the therapeutic effect was excellent in 165 cases, fair in 64 cases, acceptable in 20 cases, and poor in 13 cases, with a total success rate of 87.4%.
