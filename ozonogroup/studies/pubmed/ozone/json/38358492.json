Plant-specific measurement campaigns are required to reliably quantify the emission level that has been found to significantly vary between WWTPs. In this study, the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were quantified from five full-scale WWTPs during 4-19-day measurement campaigns conducted under both cold period conditions (water temperature below 12 \u00b0C) and warm period conditions (water temperature from 12 to 20 \u00b0C). The measurement data were studied alongside long-term monitoring data from a sixth WWTP. The calculated emission factors (EFs) varied from near 0 to 1.8% relative to the influent total nitrogen load. The results confirmed a significant seasonality of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions as well as a notable variation between WWTPs in the emission level, which a single fixed EF cannot represent. Wastewater temperature was one explanatory factor for the emission seasonality. Both low and high emissions were measured from denitrifying-nitrifying activated sludge (AS) processes, while the emissions from only nitrifying AS processes were consistently high. Nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) at the end of the aerobic zones of the AS process was linked to the variability in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions during the cold period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0008-7201-1522"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Built Environment, Aalto University, P.O.
