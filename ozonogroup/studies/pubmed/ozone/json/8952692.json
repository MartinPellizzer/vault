This study was designed to investigate the functional aspects of the macrophages that impact inflammatory processes in the lung. Macrophages recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from rats exposed to purified air or 0.8 ppm O3 were studied for their chemotactic activity, adhesive interactions with alveolar epithelial cells in culture, surface morphology, and surface expression of cell adhesion molecules. The macrophages isolated from O3-exposed rats exhibited a greater motility in response to a chemotactic stimulus than the macrophages isolated from rats exposed to purified air. The macrophages from O3-exposed animals also displayed greater adhesion when placed in culture with epithelial cells isolated from adult rat lung (ARL-14) than the macrophages from control rats. Both chemotactic motility and cell adhesion stimulated by O3 exposure were attenuated when the macrophages were incubated in the presence of monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte adhesion molecules, CD11b, or epithelial cell adhesion molecules, ICAM-1. Flow cytometry revealed a modest increase in the surface expression of CD11b but no change in ICAM-1 expression in macrophages from O3-exposed rats when compared to those from the air-exposed controls. The results demonstrate an alteration of macrophage functions following O3 exposure and suggest the dependence of these functions on the biologic characteristics, rather than the absolute expression, of the cell adhesion molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhalla", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES03521", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macrophage-1 Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chemotaxis, Leukocyte"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophage-1 Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8952692", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<429::AID-JCP3>3.0.CO;2-Q", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<429::AID-JCP3>3.0.CO;2-Q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
