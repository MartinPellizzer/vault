The primary objectives were to determine if the stresses could cause alterations in the plant responses, and to determine if any stress induced alterations in physiological or injury responses were correlated with effects on growth or yield. Responses were monitored in green pepper exposed to simulated acidic fog alone, or in combination with ambient concentrations of ozone in open-top field chambers. Both highly acidic fog and ambient ozone depressed green pepper growth and yield responses via the inhibition of photosynthesis. Applications of highly acidic fog (i.e. two exposures of pH 1.68 fog per week for 11 weeks) caused a significant depression of net photosynthesis, reduction in leaf buffering capacity, and an extensive amount of leaf injury. These alterations closely paralleled decreases in growth and yield on a percentage basis. In contrast, ambient ozone had similar impacts on net photosynthesis, growth and yield, but enhanced leaf buffering capacity, and caused no visible injury. The pollutant-specific differences in plant response are discussed with respect to whole-plant carbon metabolism and physiological compensation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, California 92521."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bytnerowicz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olszyk", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nature. 1987 Feb 12-18;325(6105):602-5", "ArticleIdList": ["3808063"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Sep;70(3):677-85", "ArticleIdList": ["16662556"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1987;47(2):95-113", "ArticleIdList": ["15092712"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Nov;73(3):630-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16663271"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1985 Nov 1;230(4725):566-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17809689"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16666330", "PMC1055603", "10.1104/pp.88.2.477"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
