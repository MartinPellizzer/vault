Fertilization is a major factor that dictates agricultural N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. In this work, as opposed to the commonly-seen highly-soluble nitrogen (N) fertilizers, the feasibility of using struvite as a slow-releasing N-fertilizer and its mechanism for mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were investigated. During the 149-d field cultivation of water spinach (Ipomoea Aquatica Forsk), struvite exhibited comparable crop yields, with a 40.8-58.1% N<sub>2</sub>O reduction compared with commercial fertilizers. In addition, struvite fertilization increased soil bacterial diversity and denitrification genes levels (narG, nirS, nirK, norB and nosZ) effectively, but decreased nitrification genes contents (amoA). By conducting partial least-square path modeling, it was found that the use of struvite would satisfy the soil N control and pH regulation, which altered N-cycling related bacteria and ultimately mitigated N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. From an economic aspect, using struvite as a N-fertilizer may increase the struvite market price from 50 to 131.7 \u20ac/ton. These findings help change the inherent impression that struvite is only suitable as a P-fertilizer, the application of struvite as N-fertilizer could effectively mitigate the agriculture N<sub>2</sub>O emission and inspire the application of struvite-based P-recovery technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
