In this research, the bactericidal and preservation effect of corona discharge plasma (CDP) was investigated. The maximum bactericidal effect was found after 20\u2009kV 4\u2009kHz CDP treatment, with 2.77 log (colony-forming unit [CFU]/g), 2.41 log (CFU/g), and 1.36 log (CFU/g) reduction for <i>Pantoea agglomerans</i>, <i>Serratia liquefaciens</i>, and <i>Kurthia zopfii</i>, respectively, after 10\u2009min of exposure. The efficiency of microbial inactivation was attributed to the increase of ozone, hydrogen peroxide and morphological changes. It was observed that the microbial level and total volatile binding nitrogen value of CDP-treated chilled pork samples were suppressed during storage, whereas the increase of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value and the changes of color were still worthy of attention. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of pulsed CDP on the inactivation of spoilage microorganism inoculated on the surface of fresh pork. The prospect of this technology in meat preservation industry was also investigated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Food Science and Light Industry, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Fangzhou", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Food Science and Light Industry, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Zhiqin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Food Science and Light Industry, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xinfu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5569-4263"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Food Science and Light Industry, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Foodborne Pathog Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101120121", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3141"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pork Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Red Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34898276", "10.1089/fpd.2021.0035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
