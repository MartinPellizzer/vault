The mass transfer and partition coefficients were calculated at various physical and chemical conditions. In addition, the reaction rate constants of ozone with phenolic and indolic compounds were also estimated independently using the method of competition kinetics and relative reaction-rate constants. Incorporating mass transfer and chemical reaction concepts, an oxidation model that considers side reactions between ozone and byproducts has been established using non-linear simultaneous differential equations. Thus, numerical computation is capable of simulating the degradation of phenolic and indolic compounds both in synthetic and real manure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jerry J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masten", "ForeName": "Susan J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11996341", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00352-9", "S0043-1354(01)00352-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
