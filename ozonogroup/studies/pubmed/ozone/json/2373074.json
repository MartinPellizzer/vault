Nevertheless, black skinned individuals rarely develop skin cancer and melanin is assumed to act as a solar screen. Since DNA is the target for solar carcinogenesis, the effect of melanin on Ultraviolet (UV)-induced thymine lesions was examined in mouse melanoma and carcinoma cells that varied in melanin content. Cells prelabeled with 14C-dThd were irradiated with UVC; DNA was isolated, purified, degraded to bases by acid hydrolysis and analyzed by HPLC. Thymine dimers were detected in all of the extracts of irradiated cells. Melanotic and hypomelanotic but not mammary carcinoma cell DNA from irradiated cells contained hydrophilic thymine derivatives. The quantity of these damaged bases was a function of both the UVC dose and the cellular melanin content. One such derivative was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as thymine glycol. The other appears to be derived from thymine glycol by further oxidation during acid hydrolysis of the DNA. The finding of oxidative DNA damage in melanin-containing cells suggests that melanin may be implicated in the etiology of caucasian skin cancer, particularly melanoma. Furthermore, the projected decrease in stratospheric ozone could impact in an unanticipated deleterious manner on dark-skinned individuals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103-2757."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huselton", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hill", "ForeName": "H Z", "Initials": "HZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Melanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrimidine Dimers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Melanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyrimidine Dimers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2373074", "10.1002/em.2850160107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
