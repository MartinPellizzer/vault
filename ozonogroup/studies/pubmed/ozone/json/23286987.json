This study explores the contributions of natural DON and chloramine incorporation to the formation of N-DBPs during chloramination. This study also evaluates the relationship between N-DBPs and carbonaceous DBPs by investigating four sources of dissolved organic matter with different DON-to-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ratios. During chloramination, dihaloacetonitrile (DXAN) formation is correlated with the summation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and dichloroacetic acids (DXAAs) yield in molar basis at pH > 6. This study tests the formation kinetics of THMs, DXAAs, and DXANs during chloramination, explores the changes in DBP formation potential before and after a sequence of ozonation and chloramination, and tracks the nitrogen source of dichloroacetonitrile. The results support the hypothesis that THMs, DXAAs, and DXANs mainly derive from similar precursors upon chloramination. In addition, the precursor of HANs was approximately 10% (on a molar basis) of that of THMs and HAAs combined. The N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential is correlated with DON/DOC in hydrophilic and transphilic fractions. Isotope (15)N-labeled monochloramine coupled with LC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to explore the nitrogen source of NDMA formed in chloraminated organic fractions. The results indicate that the nitroso group of the formed NDMA originates mainly from chloramines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
