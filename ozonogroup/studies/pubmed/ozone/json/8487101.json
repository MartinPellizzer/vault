Although 68% of phenylalanine was decomposed by ozonolysis of casein, ozonolysis caused alterations beyond the destruction of aromatic amino acid residues. Nearly the same degree of decomposition of amino acid residues was observed in casein ozonated after predigestion by pepsin. Rats were fed diets containing 8% casein supplemented with methionine and aspartic acid (8C-AA), 8% ozonated casein supplemented with methionine and free amino acids lost by ozonolysis (8OC-AA), 8% casein ozonated after predigestion by pepsin supplemented with methionine and free amino acids lost during preparation (8POC-AA) or 7.6% amino acid mixture. The growth of rats fed the 8OC-AA diet was significantly lower than that of those fed 8C-AA or 7.6AA diets. The growth of rats fed the 8POC-AA diet was comparable to growth of those fed 8OC-AA. The biological values of the 8OC-AA and 8POC-AA were comparable to that of 8C-AA, but true digestibility of 8OC-AA was significantly lower than that of 8C-AA. True digestibility 8POC-AA was significantly improved relative to 8OC-AA, but the growth of rats fed 8POC-AA was not improved relative to that of those fed 8OC-AA. Kidney and cecum weights of rats fed 8OC-AA and 8POC-AA were significantly heavier than those of the 8C-AA-fed group, although histopathological examination of kidneys showed no deterioration compared to that of the 8C-AA-fed group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience and Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kasai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwashita", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kiriyama", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caseins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.23.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Pepsin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caseins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pepsin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8487101", "10.1093/jn/123.5.893"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
