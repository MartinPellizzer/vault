In the first stage, a novel and simple degreasing solution was prepared and most of the base oil contained by OBDC was removed by flotation; in the second stage, the oil content of OBDC was further reduced by combined ultrasound + ozone (US + O<sub>3</sub>) advanced oxidation. The recommended degreasing solution was a mixture of methanol, ammonium chloride, and water with a mass ratio of 1.48.1\u2009:\u20090.25. The best flotation process was as follows: a mass ratio of OBDC to degreasing solution of 1\u2009:\u200910, stirring speed of 400 rpm and N<sub>2</sub> flotation with a flow rate of 400 mL min<sup>-1</sup> for 60 min. The oil content of OBDC can be reduced from 14.57% to 1.42% after flotation treatment and the degreasing solution can be reused more than five times. The optimal process of US + O<sub>3</sub> advanced oxidation was as follows: a mass ratio of OBDC to water of 1\u2009:\u200910, ultrasonic power of 1000 W, and an ozone flow rate of 4.0 L min<sup>-1</sup> for 100 min. The oil content of OBDC can be reduced from 1.42% to 0.14% after US + O<sub>3</sub> treatment at room temperature. The results of this paper provide a new method and idea for OBDC treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University 8 Xindu Avenue, Xindu District Chengdu Sichuan 610500 P.
