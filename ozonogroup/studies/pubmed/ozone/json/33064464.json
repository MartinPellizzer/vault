Indoor HONO varied from 0.2 to 84.0 ppb (mean: 5.5 ppb; median 3.8 ppb), an order of magnitude higher than simultaneously measured outdoor values, indicating important indoor sources. They agree well with simultaneous measurements of HONO by Laser-Photofragmentation/Laser-Induced Fluorescence. Before any combustion activities, the mixing ratio of 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 ppb is indicative of secondary sources such as multiphase formation from NO<sub>2</sub>. Cooking (with propane gas), especially the use of an oven, led to significant enhancements up to 84 ppb, with elevated mixing ratios persisting for a few days due to slow desorption from indoor surface reservoirs. Floor bleach cleaning led to prolonged, substantial decreases of up to 71-90% due to reactive processes. Air conditioning modulated HONO mixing ratios driven by condensation to wet surfaces in the AC unit. Enhanced ventilation also significantly lowered mixing ratios. Other conditions including human occupancy, ozone addition, and cleaning with terpene, natural product, and vinegar cleaners had a much smaller influence on HONO background levels measured following these activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9565-8777"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, United States."}], "LastName": "Bottorff", "ForeName": "Brandon", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, United States."}], "LastName": "Reidy", "ForeName": "Emily", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, United States."}], "LastName": "Rosales", "ForeName": "Colleen Marciel F", "Initials": "CMF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6248-9644"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania 17837, United States."}], "LastName": "Collins", "ForeName": "Douglas B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Texas 78712, United States."}], "LastName": "Novoselac", "ForeName": "Atila", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6470-9970"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Farmer", "ForeName": "Delphine K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0940-0353"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Vance", "ForeName": "Marina E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9899-4215"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, United States."}], "LastName": "Stevens", "ForeName": "Philip S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3372-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Conditioning"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33064464", "10.1021/acs.est.0c05356"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
