Electro-peroxone (EP) process where H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is generated in-situ by electrolysis is an emerging advanced oxidation process and an improvement of traditional peroxone method (O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). In this work, a flow-through EP process was compared with ozonation and electrolysis for simultaneous disinfection and degradation of tetracycline (TC). The disinfection effect by EP was higher than the sum of standalone ozone and electrolysis and the coupling coefficient of ozonation and electrolysis in EP process was 1.2. The flow-through EP system presented similar efficiency for separately and simultaneously treating E. coli and TC. For the actual secondary effluent treatment, trihalomethanes, haloacetonitrile and halonitromethanes, the main disinfection by-products, were much lower than the WHO's thresholds for drinking water. TOC and COD removal was 44% and 65%, respectively, at flow rate of 35\u2009mL/min. BOD<sub>5</sub>, bacteria, pH and other parameters in the effluent could satisfy the recreational landscape water quality standard, and the required energy consumption was 0.47\u2009kW\u2009h/m<sup>3</sup> at the flow rate 35\u2009mL/min. Most of the degradation products were small-molecule organic acids, and possible degradation pathway of TC was suggested."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
