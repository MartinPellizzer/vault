When the O3 concentration in the gas phase was in the range of 10 to 40 g O3/m3, the O3 dissolved for a short time period was proportional to the gaseous O3 concentration. In this range, the ozonation reaction was first order for each reactant and the overall reaction was second order. At 25 degrees C, in an aqueous solution, the reaction rate constant was estimated to be 10.048 L/mol.sec. The reaction rate was much greater than the mass-transfer rate, indicating that the reaction of O3 and PCP was an interface reaction on the surface of gaseous O3 bubbles. The final product of the PCP ozonation was oxalic acid, with the carbon yield of the reaction being 59.4%. The ozonation of PCP in the aqueous solution was not a radical reaction but a direct reaction between O3 and PCP molecules under the conditions investigated in this study, since O3 has a high selectivity toward PCP. The reaction rate increased with the reaction temperature up to 35 degrees C but decreased at temperatures greater than 35 degrees C due to the decreased solubility of O3. The addition of H2O2 did not increase the reaction rate significantly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D9BSU0SE4T", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentachlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pentachlorophenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10786007", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
