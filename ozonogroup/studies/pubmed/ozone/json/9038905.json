To determine whether differences in the delivered dose of O3 to the lung could help explain these differences, C3 and B6 mice were exposed to 18O-labeled ozone (18O3), and the resulting 18O concentrations in pulmonary tissues were monitored as an indicator of O3 delivered dose. Body core temperatures (Tco) of similarly treated mice were measured during O3 exposures (using surgically implanted temperature probes) in an effort to correlate lung O3 dose to changes in basal metabolism. Immediately after exposure to 18O3, C3 mice had 46% less 18O (per mg dry wt) in lungs and 61% less in tracheas than B6 mice. Nasal 18O tended to be lower in the C3 mice, but these differences were not significant. Although both strains responded to the O3 exposure with significant decreases in Tco, C3 mice had a 70% greater mean temperature x time product decrease during the exposure than B6 mice. These results suggest that the strain differences in O3 susceptibility may be due to differences in O3 dose to the lung, which may be related to differences in the ability of the mice to lower their Tco in response to O3 exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pulmonary Toxicology Branch, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slade", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watkinson", "ForeName": "W P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hatch", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Telemetry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9038905", "10.1152/ajplung.1997.272.1.L73"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
