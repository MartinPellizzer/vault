(loblolly pine) seedlings of 30 open-pollinated and five full-sib families, representing a wide range in geographic origin, were grown in charcoal-filtered (CF) air or CF-air supplemented with 160 or 320 nl liter(-1) ozone for 8 h day(-1), 4 days week(-1), for 9 weeks. Visible foliar injury (banded chlorosis, tip burn and premature senescence) was apparent in many families after 3 weeks in 320 nl liter(-1) and 6 weeks in 160 nl liter(-1) ozone. Decreases in relative height and root collar diameter growth rates, total dry weight, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, and root/shoot ratios were evident after 9 weeks of treatment with both 160 and 320 nl liter(-1) ozone. For relative height growth rates, family differences in response to ozone were observed. By the study's end, net photosynthesis rates were 15% less for the 320 nl liter(-1) ozone treatment as compared to the CF-air treatment. Total soluble sugar and total starch content of roots were not changed after 9 weeks of ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forest Resources, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wiselogel", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bailey", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newton", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fong", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092127", "10.1016/0269-7491(91)90043-v", "0269-7491(91)90043-V"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
