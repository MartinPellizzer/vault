By measuring a single frequency only, it is not possible to separate the frequency change due to mass change from that due to temperature change. In the temperature insensitive microbalance technique, measurements of two frequencies, the fundamental mode and third overtone frequencies of an SC-cut resonator, yield two equations with two unknowns. This allows the separation of mass change effects from temperature change effects. Dual mode excitation can be used for highly accurate resonator self-temperature sensing over wide temperature ranges. SC-cut resonators are also thermal transient compensated. These unique properties allowed the development of a temperature compensated microbalance that is highly sensitive to mass changes, which can be used in rapidly changing thermal environments, over wide temperature ranges, and which requires neither temperature control nor a thermometer other than the resonator. To demonstrate the performance of this microbalance, SC-cut resonators were coated with thin polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) photoresist films then placed into a UV-ozone cleaning chamber that initially was at about 20 degrees C. When the UV lamp was turned on, the UV-ozone removed PMMA from the surfaces while the chamber temperature rose to about 60 degrees C. The frequency changes due to mass changes could be accurately determined, independently of the frequency changes due to temperature changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, William Patterson University, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierce", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vig", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control", "NlmUniqueID": "9882735", "ISSNLinking": "0885-3010"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18244285", "10.1109/58.726449"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
