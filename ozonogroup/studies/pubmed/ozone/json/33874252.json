Ultrastructural damage was apparent in the leaves fumigated with as low as 0.05 \u03bcl l<sup>-1</sup> for 8 h a day for 6 d. Ozone induced an increase in both the number and size of the plastoglobules but a decrease in chloroplast dimensions. These changes in the chloroplasts developed further even after O<sub>3</sub> fumigation had been discontinued. The plastoglobules were electron dense in the early stages of exposure to O<sub>3</sub> but subsequently became electron translucent. Finally large plastoglobules were extruded into the vacuole, a phenomenon which may partly account for the reduction in chloroplast size. Ozone also caused disruption of the tonoplast and this was followed by collapse of the cells. Low concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> appear to accelerate senescence of the chloroplasts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyake", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumura", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Division, the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujinuma", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Totsuka", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Athanassious, R.
