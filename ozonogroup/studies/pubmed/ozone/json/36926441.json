This case reported a 65-year-old male with a neuropathic ulcer in the right foot came to Ahwaz Wound Clinic after the wound had not healed with routine treatments. In addition to the routine treatment program, we used tropical ozone therapy and autohemotherapy (blood ozone therapy) for 2 months. Zinc supplementation (50 mg) was also administered daily during the treatment. The DFU was clearly healed with diminishing inflammation and wound closing, and there were no side effects. Additionally, the C-reactive protein level was obviously decreased during the treatment indicating effective suppression of infection. This way indicates a helpful new intervention approach to the treatment of DFU."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2023 Advanced Biomedical Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Education and Research, Army Health Center of Excellence (NEZAJA), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dadfar", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Medical Basic Sciences Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khorsandi", "ForeName": "Layasadat", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Goujani", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Ahvaz Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyyed Farid", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious and Tropical Diseases Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aslani", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Adv Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101586897", "ISSNLinking": "2277-9175"}, "CoiStatement": "There is no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Wang Y, Shao T, Wang J, Huang X, Deng X, Cao Y, et al.
