Then, as combination groups, half of the groups were incubated with 30\u00a0g/mL ozone for 25\u00a0min. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -\u00a09 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) levels were measured using the MTT test, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry, respectively.", "When compared to simply doxorubicin-applied cells without ozone treatment, each dose of doxorubicin +\u00a0ozone treatment considerably boosted L929 viability but significantly decreased BT-474 viability. Additionally, the combination increased the apoptotic impact of doxorubicin on BT-474 but not L929 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). TGF-, MMP-2, and MMP-9 levels of L929 after combination were substantially higher than those of the other groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Doxorubicin's effect on BT-474's protein levels, which had significantly decreased in comparison to those of the other groups, was reversed by the combination treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "Doxorubicin's anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects were enhanced by ozone treatment in BT-474 cells, but it also repaired and healed healthy fibroblast cells that had been harmed by the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapy drug. If doxorubicin and ozone treatment are coupled, BT-474 cells may develop resistance to it through expressions of TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, MMP-2, and MMP-9."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
