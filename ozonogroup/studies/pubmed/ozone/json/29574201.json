These limitations can be overcome by combining these two processes for a cost-effective pharmaceutical removal. A three-step biological-ozone-biological (BO<sub>3</sub>B) treatment process was therefore designed for the enhanced pharmaceutical removal from wastewater effluent. The first biological step removed 38% of ozone scavenging TOC, thus proportionally reducing the absolute ozone input for the subsequent ozonation. Complementariness between biological and ozone treatment, i.e. targeting different pharmaceuticals, resulted in cost-effective pharmaceutical removal by the overall BO<sub>3</sub>B process. At a low ozone dose of 0.2\u202fg O<sub>3</sub>/g TOC and an HRT of 1.46\u202fh in the biological reactors, the removal of 8 out of 9 pharmaceuticals exceeded 85%, except for metoprolol (60%). Testing various ozone doses and HRTs revealed that pharmaceuticals were ineffectively removed at 0.1\u202fg O3/g TOC and an HRT of 0.3\u202fh. At HRTs of 0.47 and 1.46\u202fh easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were over 95% removed by biological treatment. The biorecalcitrant carbamazepine was completely ozonated at a dose of 0.4\u202fg O<sub>3</sub>/g TOC. Ozonation products are likely biodegraded in the last biological reactor as a 17% TOC removal was found. No appreciable acute toxicity towards D.\u00a0magna, P.\u00a0subcapitata and V.\u00a0fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual BO<sub>3</sub>B reactors. The BO<sub>3</sub>B process is estimated to increase the yearly wastewater treatment tariff per population equivalent in the Netherlands by less than 10%. Overall, the BO<sub>3</sub>B process is a cost-effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.
