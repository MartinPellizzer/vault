The triple-oxygen isotope analysis of the NO(3)(-) produced during this reaction, achieved in this study using the bacterial denitrifier method followed by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), directly yields the \u0394(17)O value transferred from O(3). This isotope transfer process was investigated in a series of vacuum-line experiments, which were conducted by exposing coated filters to O(3) of various known \u0394(17)O values and then determining the isotopic composition of the NO(3)(-) produced on the filter.", "The isotope transfer experiments revealed a strong linear correlation between the \u0394(17)O of the O(3) produced and that of the oxygen atom transferred to NO(3)(-), with a slope of 1.55 for samples with bulk \u0394(17)O(O(3)) values in the atmospheric range (20-40\u2030). This finding is in agreement with theoretical postulates that place the (17) O-excess on only the terminal oxygen atoms of ozone. Ambient measurements yield average \u0394(17)O(O(3))(bulk) values in agreement with previous studies (22.9 \u00b1 1.9\u2030).", "The nitrite-coated filter technique is a sufficiently robust, field-deployable method for the determination of the triple-oxygen isotopic composition of tropospheric O(3). Further ambient measurements will undoubtedly lead to an improved quantitative view of natural \u0394(17)O(O(3)) variation and transfer in the atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Glaciologie et G\u00e9ophysique de l'Environnement, Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier-Grenoble 1/CNRS, Grenoble, France. william.vicars@lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vicars", "ForeName": "William C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erbland", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savarino", "ForeName": "Jo\u00ebl", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22499198", "10.1002/rcm.6218"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
