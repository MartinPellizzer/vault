Tibet is an important remote area on Earth, with various climates and extremely high elevation (average\u00a0~\u00a04000\u00a0m), which makes it a good place to study the spatiotemporal distribution of surface ozone and explore the causes. Based on ground monitoring data from 18 stations on Tibet between 2015 and 2019, the annual, seasonal, monthly, and diurnal variations of surface ozone were analyzed. The annual mean values (60.7-72.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) presented an increasing trend during the past five years, with seasonal concentrations of surface ozone higher in spring than in winter. Spatially, both the ground observations and high-resolution remote sensing data indicated that the surface ozone was relatively high in the southwest regions of Tibet, and low in the southeast and northeast areas. Geodetector analysis found that relative humidity (RH), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and solar radiation (SR) were the top three individual factors affecting surface ozone distribution, while NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> showed less influence. All influencing factors showed an improvement through the two-factor interaction. The associations of RH\u2229PM<sub>10</sub> (q\u00a0=\u00a00.77), RH\u2229NDVI (q\u00a0=\u00a00.72), and NDVI\u2229SR (q\u00a0=\u00a00.73) exhibited a strong impact on surface ozone distribution, suggesting that places with sparse vegetation cover, dry climate and strong SR would usually cause high atmospheric ozone burden. This could also explain why concentrations of surface ozone continue to increase in some remote areas worldwide with ecological deterioration and desertification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
