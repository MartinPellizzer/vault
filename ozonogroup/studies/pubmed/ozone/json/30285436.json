The potential for oxidative dissolution of THPC Au<sub>2nm</sub> NPs in the presence of bromide is about 250 mV negative of 4 nm diameter citrate-stabilized Au NPs (Cit Au<sub>4nm</sub> NPs) and 450 mV negative of bulk Au, which provides us with an easy method to assess the size stability using anodic stripping voltammetry. The THPC Au<sub>2nm</sub> NPs show a strong CO<sub>2</sub> reduction wave at about -0.40 V (vs RHE), which is nonexistent for the Cit Au<sub>4nm</sub> NPs or bulk Au. The THPC Au<sub>2nm</sub> NPs are also comparatively more electroactive for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In acid electrolyte, however, the potential for surface Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> formation on THPC Au<sub>2nm</sub> NPs is significantly negative relative to bulk Au, and a single cycle through the surface oxide and reduction waves leads to an increase in the NP size to about 4 nm. Similarly, the THPC Au<sub>2nm</sub> NPs undergo Ostwald ripening in the presence of bromide within 5 min at potentials well before oxidation, which increases their size to 4-10 nm in diameter by 35 min. Exposure to ozone for only 1-2 min also causes the THPC Au<sub>2nm</sub> NPs to increase in size to about 4 nm. In comparison, Cit Au<sub>4nm</sub> NPs are stable under all of these conditions, requiring much longer times to change in size. These differences in reactivity and size stability are due to the different Au NP size. Sub-2 nm diameter NPs with weak stabilizers are potentially very useful for electrocatalysis, but their low oxidation potential and poor size stability are major issues of concern."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Louisville , Louisville , Kentucky 40292 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pattadar", "ForeName": "Dhruba K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Louisville , Louisville , Kentucky 40292 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0685-0180"], "LastName": "Zamborini", "ForeName": "Francis P", "Initials": "FP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30285436", "10.1021/jacs.8b06830"]}}]}
