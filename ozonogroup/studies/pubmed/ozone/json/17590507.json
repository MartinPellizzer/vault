The temporal variations of the concentrations of phenol and the intermediate products were monitored by HPLC and GC-MS, respectively. It has been found that the effect of various gases bubbling on phenol degradation rate ranked in the following order: oxygen-containing ozone>oxygen>argon>nitrogen. The high gas bubbling flow rate was beneficial to the removal of phenol. It was found that the degradation proceeded differently when in the presence and absence of catalysts. The phenol removal rate was increased when ferrous ion was added. This considerable enhancement may be due to the Fenton's reaction. What's more, putting the chemical additives hydrogen peroxide into the reactor led to a dramatic increase in phenol degradation rate. The mechanism was due to the direct or indirect photolysis and pyrolysis destruction in plasma channel. Furthermore, the intermediate products were monitored by GC-MS under three degradation conditions. More THBs were generated under degradation conditions without gases bubbling or adding any catalyst, and more DHBs under the condition of adding ferrous ion, and more carboxylic acids under the condition of oxygen-containing ozone gas bubbling. Consequently, three distinct degradation pathways based on different conditions were proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution Control Technologies, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310028, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Yongjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Lecheng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xingwang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Minghua", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "339NCG44TV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17590507", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.05.024", "S0304-3894(07)00741-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
