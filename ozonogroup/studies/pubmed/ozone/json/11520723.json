Wild-type mice, TNF p55 or p75 receptor knockout mice (p55 TNFR -/- and p75 TNFR -/-), as well as double receptor knockout mice (p55/p75 TNFR -/-), were exposed to O(3). Three hours after cessation of O(3), airway responses to inhaled methacholine were determined by whole body plethysmography using changes in enhanced pause (Penh) as an index of airway narrowing. In wild-type mice, O(3) exposure (0.5 ppm, 3 h) caused a significant increase in airway responsiveness as indicated by a 1.2 log leftward shift in the methacholine dose- response curve. In contrast, in p55/p75 TNFR -/- mice, O(3) caused only a 0.5 log shift in the dose-response curve (p < 0.05 compared with wild-type). Similar results were obtained in p75 TNFR -/- mice. In contrast, O(3)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness was not different in WT and p55 TNFR -/- mice. During O(3) exposure (1 pm, 3 h), minute ventilation (V E) decreased by 64 +/- 4% in wild-type, but only 24 +/- 5% in p55/p75 TNFR -/- mice, indicating that despite their reduced O(3)-induced AHR, the TNFR-deficient mice actually inhaled a greater dose of O(3). Similar results were obtained in p75 -/- mice, whereas changes in V E induced by O(3) were the same in wild-type and p55 -/- mice. PMN numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered 21 h after cessation of exposure to O(3) (2 ppm, 3 h) were significantly increased compared with after air exposure but were not different in wild-type and p55/p75 TNFR -/- mice. Our results indicate that TNF contributes to the AHR but not the PMN emigration induced by acute O(3) exposure.", "whole body plethysmography; polymorphonuclear leukocytes; minute ventilation; knockout mice; methacholine"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology Program, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. sshore@hsph.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shore", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartzman", "ForeName": "I N", "Initials": "IN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le Blanc", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "G G", "Initials": "GG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doerschuk", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL33009", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL52466", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL56383", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, CD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bronchoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Wild"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, CD"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "immunology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoconstrictor Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Knockout"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography, Whole Body"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11520723", "10.1164/ajrccm.164.4.2001016"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
