The quorum sensing (QS) system is instrumental in coordinating bacterial growth and metabolisms. However, the responses and regulatory mechanisms of bacteria to various disinfection technologies through quorum sensing are still unclear. This study examines the inactivation effect of chlorination and ozonation on biofilms and planktonic cells of QS signaling-deficient mutants of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Cell counting and viability assessment revealed that the combined disinfection of chlorine and ozone was the most effective for inactivating planktonic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> within 10 min of exposure. Additionally, microfluidic chip culture demonstrated that the secretion of quinolone signals escalated biofilms' disinfection resistance. Disinfection exposure significantly altered the gene expression of wild-type strains and QS signaling-deficient mutants. Moreover, the QS system triggered multilayered gene expression programs as a responsive protection to disinfectant exposure, including oxidative stress, ribosome synthesis, and the nutrient absorption of bacteria. These insights broaden our understanding of bacterial QS in response to disinfection, promising potential strategies toward efficient disinfection processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, P.
