However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these associations. Epigenetics may be one plausible biologic link. Here, we sought to identify site-specific and global DNA methylation (DNAm) changes, in developmentally relevant tissues, associated with prenatal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Additionally, we assessed whether sex-specific changes in methylation exist and whether DNAm changes are consistently observed across tissues.", "Genome-scale DNAm measurements were obtained using the Infinium HumanMethylation450k platform for 133 placenta and 175 cord blood specimens from Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) neonates. Ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels were based on prenatal address locations of EARLI mothers and the Environmental Protection Agency's AirNOW monitoring network using inverse distance weighting. We computed sample-level aggregate methylation measures for each of 5 types of genomic regions including genome-wide, open sea, shelf, shore, and island regions. Linear regression was performed for each genomic region; per-sample aggregate methylation measures were modeled as a function of quantitative exposure level with covariate adjustment. In addition, bumphunting was performed to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with prenatal O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposures in each tissue and by sex, with adjustment for technical and biological sources of variation.", "We identified global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation related to prenatal exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in 2 developmentally relevant tissues. Neonates with increased prenatal O<sub>3</sub> exposure had lower aggregate levels of DNAm at CpGs located in open sea and shelf regions of the genome. We identified 6 DMRs associated with prenatal NO<sub>2</sub> exposure, including 3 sex-specific. An additional 3 sex-specific DMRs were associated with prenatal O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels. DMRs initially detected in cord blood samples (n\u202f=\u202f4) showed consistent exposure-related changes in DNAm in placenta. However, the DMRs initially detected in placenta (n\u202f=\u202f5) did not show DNAm differences in cord blood and, thus, they appear to be tissue-specific.", "We observed global, locus, and sex-specific methylation changes associated with prenatal NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposures. Our findings support DNAm is a biologic target of prenatal air pollutant exposures and highlight epigenetic involvement in sex-specific differential susceptibility to environmental exposure effects in 2 developmentally relevant tissues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
