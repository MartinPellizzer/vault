Methyl radicals were produced by photolysis of acetone at 193.3 nm or in the reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms O((1)D), produced in the photolysis of N2O at 193.3 nm, with CH4, and subsequent reaction of OH with CH4. Temporal profiles of CH3 were recorded via absorption at 216.36 and 216.56 nm using a xenon arc lamp and a spectrograph. The absolute intensity of the photolysis light inside the reactor was determined by an accurate in situ actinometry based on the ozone formation in photolysis of N2O/O2/N2 mixtures. The rate constant of reaction 1 in the high-pressure limit has a negative temperature dependence: k1,inf = (5.66 \u00b1 0.43) \u00d7 10(-11)(T/298 K)(-0.37) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (292-714 K)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry and Environmental Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey 07102, United States."}], "LastName": "Sangwan", "ForeName": "Manuvesh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry and Environmental Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey 07102, United States."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Institute of Chemical Kinetics and Combustion, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia."}], "LastName": "Chesnokov", "ForeName": "Evgeni N", "Initials": "EN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry and Environmental Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey 07102, United States."}], "LastName": "Krasnoperov", "ForeName": "Lev N", "Initials": "LN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25973698", "10.1021/acs.jpca.5b01276"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
