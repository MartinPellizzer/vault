A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) was then used to analyze the VOCs. The analytical results show that VOC concentrations increase with traffic flow rate, and emission profiles in the three tunnels are mostly in the range C2-C6. In addition to the traffic conditions and vehicle type, the pattern of emissions in each tunnel was also influenced by other factors, such as vehicle age, nearby pollution sources, and the spatial or temporal variation of VOCs in the urban atmosphere. The ozone formation potential (OFP) in each tunnel was assessed based on the maximum incremental reactivities of the organic species, demonstrating that OFP increases with traffic flow rate. Vehicle distribution influences the contributions of organic group to OFP in a tunnel. Meanwhile, when ranked in descending order of contribution to OFP in all tunnels, the organic groups followed the sequence olefins, aromatics, and paraffins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Republic of China. shin@mail.nsysu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "Y T", "Initials": "YT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12568259", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466114"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
