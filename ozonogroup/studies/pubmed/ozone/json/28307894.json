Concentrations of foliar starch and secondary compounds are reported in this paper. Starch concentrations remained unaffected by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and/or O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during the first 2 study years. But in the autumn of the last study year, a significantly higher concentration of starch was found in current-year needles of trees exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> compared with ambient air. There were large differences in concentrations of starch and secondary compounds between individual trees. Elevated concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and/or O<sub>3</sub> did not have any significant effects on the concentrations of foliar total monoterpenes, total resin acids or total phenolics. Significantly higher concentrations of monoterpenes and resin acids and mostly lower concentrations of starch were found in trees growing without chambers than in those growing in open-top chambers, while there were no differences in concentrations of total phenolics between trees growing without or in chambers. The results suggest that elevated concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> might increase foliar starch concentrations in Scots pine, while secondary metabolites remain unaffected. Realistically elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations do not have clear effects on carbon allocation to starch and secondary compounds even after 3 exposure years."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, P.O.
