The Environmental Justice Index (EJI) is a new measure that consolidates multiple environmental health hazards.", "This analysis aims to explore how environmental vulnerabilities vary by race/ethnicity and whether they predict cognitive outcomes in a clinical trial of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).", "We used data from a clinical trial of 107 MCI participants (28% minorities). Using the EJI, we extracted 40 measures of neighborhood environmental and social vulnerability including air and water pollution, access to recreational spaces, exposure to coal and lead mines, and area poverty. We also examined the relationship of the EJI to the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Data was analyzed using regressions, correlations, and <i>t</i>-tests.", "Environmental Burden Rank (EBR) across the sample (0.53\u00b10.32) was near the 50th percentile nationally. When divided by race/ethnicity, environmental (<i>p</i>\u200a=\u200a0.025) and social (<i>p</i>\u200a<\u200a0.0001) vulnerabilities were significantly elevated for minorities, specifically for exposure to ozone, diesel particulate matter, carcinogenic air toxins, and proximity to treatment storage and disposal sites. ADI state decile was not correlated with the EBR. Neither EBR nor ADI were a significant predictor of cognitive decline.", "To our knowledge, this is the first study to link the EJI to an MCI trial. Despite limitations of a relatively small sample size, the study illustrates the potential of the EJI to provide deeper phenotyping of the exposome and diversity in clinical trial subjects."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 \u2013 The authors.
