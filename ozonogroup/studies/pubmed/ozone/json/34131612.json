We examined the interaction between fetal exposure to maternal smoking and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) or fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) on birth weight, neonatal adiposity, and body mass index (BMI) trajectories through age 3 years.", "Participants were 526 mother-child pairs, born \u226537 weeks. Cotinine was measured at ~27 weeks gestation. Whole pregnancy and trimester-specific O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were estimated via. inverse-distance weighted interpolation from stationary monitors. Neonatal adiposity (fat mass percentage) was measured via. air displacement plethysmography. Child weight and length/height were abstracted from medical records. Interaction was assessed by introducing cotinine (<31.5 vs. \u226531.5 ng/mL [indicating active smoking]), O<sub>3</sub>/PM<sub>2.5</sub> (low [tertiles 1-2] vs. high [tertile 3]), and their product term in linear regression models for birth weight and neonatal adiposity and mixed-effects models for BMI trajectories.", "The rate of BMI growth among offspring jointly exposed to maternal smoking and high PM<sub>2.5</sub> (between 8.1 and 12.7 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) in the third trimester was more rapid than would be expected due to the individual exposures alone (0.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> per square root year; 95% CI = 0.1, 1.5; <i>P</i> for interaction = 0.03). We did not detect interactions between maternal smoking and O<sub>3</sub> or PM<sub>2.5</sub> at any other time on birth weight, neonatal adiposity, or BMI trajectories.", "Although PM<sub>2.5</sub> was generally below the EPA annual air quality standards of 12.0 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, exposure during the third trimester may influence BMI trajectories when combined with maternal smoking."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
