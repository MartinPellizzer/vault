Here, we attempted to determine the relationship between these factors by numerical simulation of atmospheric parameters, such as total ozone, using a simplified \"SMART2\" model for radiative transfer. Both forms of UV were almost linearly correlated with each other for a comparably large UV radiation exposure, larger than UV Index ~1.6. If erythemally weighted UV, which carries a risk of sunburn, is known, the amount of UV exposure needed for vitamin D synthesis in the epidermis can be estimated using this relationship. The production of 10\u00a0\u03bcg (400\u00a0IU) of vitamin D per day takes approximately 1/3 of the time needed to reach the minimal erythemal dose (MED) for an effective skin area of 600\u00a0cm<sup>2</sup> for skin phototype III. For an area of 1200\u00a0cm<sup>2</sup> , 1/6 of that exposure time suffices. From a UV Index that is commonly used, the risks and benefits can be evaluated using this linear relationship, which will enable people to effectively manage their UV exposure and consider the risks and benefits to optimize health outcomes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 The Authors.
