Caldeo during storage at 6\u2009\u00b0C for 13\u2009days. Fruits were kept in cold storage and treated with 0.15\u2009ppm gaseous O<sub>3</sub> during the day and 0.3\u2009ppm overnight; control fruits (CK) were stored in normal atmosphere.", "Firmness was higher and ethylene concentration significantly lower in O<sub>3</sub> fruits compared with CK fruits. During storage, microbial counts were lower in both O<sub>3</sub> and CK fruits; from day 9, O<sub>3</sub> fruits showed a significant decrease in mesophilic aerobes. Additionally, total carotenoids had a tendency to be higher, with no significant differences between CK and O<sub>3</sub> fruits. The same trend was observed for ascorbic acid, colour, total soluble solids content and acidity. Finally, O<sub>3</sub> treatment reduced the activities of cell wall enzymes \u03b1-arabinopyranosidase, \u03b2-galactopyranosidase and polygalacturonase starting from day 3 of storage. Pectin methyl esterase activity did not seem to be affected by O<sub>3</sub> treatment.", "Gaseous O<sub>3</sub> treatment during cold storage was effective in decreasing ethylene production and delaying fruit softening in cantaloupe melon by extending quality maintenance. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Toti", "ForeName": "Mauro", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrie De Nora SpA, Milano, Italy."}], "LastName": "Carboni", "ForeName": "Cristian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1866-8741"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Botondi", "ForeName": "Rinaldo", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis melo"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Storage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28612399", "10.1002/jsfa.8485"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
