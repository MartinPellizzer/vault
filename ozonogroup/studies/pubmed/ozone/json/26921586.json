Optimizations of the reactants, products, intermediates and transition states are carried out at the BHandHLYP/6-311+G(d,p) level. Single point energy calculations are performed at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d,p) level based on the optimized structures. The detailed mechanism is presented and discussed. Various possible H (or Cl)-abstraction and C (or As)-addition/elimination pathways are considered. The results show that the As-addition/elimination is more energetically favorable than the other mechanisms. Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory is used to compute the rate constants over the possible atmospheric temperature range of 200-3000\u00a0K and the pressure range of 10(-8)-10(9)\u00a0Torr. The calculated rate constant is in good agreement with the available experimental data. The total rate coefficient shows positive temperature dependence and pressure independence. The modified three-parameter Arrhenius expressions for the total rate coefficient and individual rate coefficients are represented. Calculation results show that major product is CHClCHAs(OOO)Cl2 (s-IM3) at the temperature below 600\u00a0K and O2\u00a0+\u00a0CHClCHAsOCl2 (s-P9) play an important role at the temperature between 600 and 3000\u00a0K. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations indicate that CHCl(OOO)CHAsCl2 (s-IM3) and CHOAsCl2 (s-P5) can take photolysis easily in the sunlight. Due to the absence of spectral information for arsenide, computational vibrational spectra of the important intermediates and products are also analyzed to provide valuable evidence for subsequent experimental identification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
