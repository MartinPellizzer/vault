Sequences of 1139 clones (91 %) matched the EBI/NCBI database entries. For 578 clones, no putative function could be assigned. Most abundant transcripts were O-methyltransferases, representing 7 % of all sequenced clones. ESTs were organized into 12 functional categories according to the MIPS database. Among them, 12 % (early)/15 % (late) were associated with disease and defence, 19/11 % with cell structure, 4/10 % with signal transduction, and 9/6 % with transcription. The expression pattern of selected ESTs (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit [rbcS], WRKY-type transcription factor, ultraviolet-B-repressible protein, aquaporine, glutathione S-transferase, catalase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, and pathogenesis-related protein 1 [PR1]) was analysed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) which confirmed changed transcript levels upon ozone treatment of European beech saplings. The ESTs characterized will contribute to a better understanding of forest tree genomics and also to a comparison of ozone-responsive genes in woody and herbaceous plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GSF--National Research Center for Environment and Health, Institute of Biochemical Plant Pathology, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstrasse 1, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olbrich", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Betz", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerstner", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Langebartels", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandermann", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ernst", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Expressed Sequence Tags"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Library"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16388470", "10.1055/s-2005-873001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
