HEI supports research on all major pollutants, including regulated pollutants (such as carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter) and unregulated pollutants (such as diesel engine exhaust, methanol, and aldehydes). To date, HEI has supported more than 200 projects at institutions in North America and Europe and has published over 100 research reports. Typically, HEI receives half its funds from the US Environmental Protection Agency and half from 28 manufacturers and marketers of motor vehicles and engines in the US. Occasionally, funds from other public and private organizations either support special projects or provide resources for a portion of an HEI study. Regardless of funding sources, HEI exercises complete autonomy in setting its research priorities and in reaching its conclusions. An independent Board of Directors governs HEI. The Institute's Research and Review Committees serve complementary scientific purposes and draw distinguished scientists as members. The results of HEI-funded studies are made available as Research Reports, which contain both the Investigators' Report and the Review Committee's evaluation of the work's scientific quality and regulatory relevance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205-2179, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samet", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dominici", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeger", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dockery", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Res Rep Health Eff Inst", "NlmUniqueID": "8812230", "ISSNLinking": "1041-5505"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bayes Theorem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11098531"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
