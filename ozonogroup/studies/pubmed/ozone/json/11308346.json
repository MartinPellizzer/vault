The thujone diastereomers are rapidly metabolized convulsants acting as noncompetitive blockers of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channel. Synthesis and analysis of the metabolites are essential steps in understanding their health effects. Oxidation of alpha- and beta-thujones as their 2,3-enolates with oxodiperoxymolybdenum(pyridine)(hexamethylphosphoric triamide) gave the corresponding (2R)-2-hydroxythujones assigned by (1)H and (13)C NMR and X-ray crystallography. alpha-Thujone was converted to 4-hydroxy-alpha- and -beta-thujones via the 3,4-enol acetate on oxidation with peracid and osmium tetroxide, respectively. Ozonation provided 7-hydroxy-alpha- and -beta-thujones, and by dehydration provided the 7,8-dehydro compounds. 4,10-Dehydrothujone was prepared from sabinene via sabinol. The hydroxy and dehydro derivatives are readily identified and analyzed by GC/MS as the parent compounds and trimethylsilyl and methyloxime derivatives. A separate study established that all of these compounds are metabolites of alpha- and beta-thujones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology Laboratory, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, 115 Wellman Hall, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-3112, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sirisoma", "ForeName": "N S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00f6ld", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Casida", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES08419", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Additives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8ZI5R3T54Q", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-thujone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Additives"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemical synthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11308346", "10.1021/jf001445+", "jf001445+"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
