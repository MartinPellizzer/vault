Hormetic doses responses were induced by a wide range of chemical and physical agents in 34 plant species for pollen germination and pollen tube growth/elongation. Agents inducing such hormetic dose/concentration responses in pollen included nutrients, growth-promoting agents, plant and animal hormones, toxic substances, including heavy metals such as cadmium, gaseous pollutants such as ozone, as well as ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. This paper provides further evidence for the broad generality of the hormesis dose response, supporting substantial prior findings that the hormetic response is independent of biological model, inducing agent, and endpoints measured. Given the widespread potential of inducing hormetic dose responses in pollen, these findings indicate the need to explore their emerging biological, ecological, agricultural, economic and public health implications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
