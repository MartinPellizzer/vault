In this study, we determined the effects of three O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (charcoal-filtered air, CF, non-filtered air, NF and non-filtered air+40 nmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>, NF40), two water treatments (well-watered, WW, and mild drought, MD, 60% of WW in volumetric soil water content), and their interactions on the light-saturated photosynthesis rate (<i>A</i><sub>sat</sub>) and on the activity of antioxidant enzymes and soluble proteins of the poplar '546' (<i>Populus deltoids</i> cv. 55/56\u00d7<i>P. deltoides</i> cv. Imperial). Results showed that <i>A</i><sub>sat</sub> significantly decreased with elevated O<sub>3</sub>, and with interactions between O<sub>3</sub> and drought. Drought significantly reduced the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) but did not affect the activities of peroxidase (POD) or ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Reduction ranges in CAT and SOD increased with drought duration. APX activity significantly decreased with increasing O<sub>3</sub> and drought, but soluble protein content did not. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were not significantly affected by elevated O<sub>3</sub> and their interactions. Results provide a scientific basis for protection of poplar plantations in response to increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and drought under environmental changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Loess Plateau, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hui-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pin", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Resources, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yin-Bo", "Initials": "YB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30188081", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201712176"]}}]}
