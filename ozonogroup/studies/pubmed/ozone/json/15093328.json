Pros) were exposed to a range of O3 concentrations up to 70 nl litre(-1) for 9 h day(-1) in the presence (45 nl litre(-1)) and absence (21 nl litre(-1)) of enhanced NH3 in 12 open-top chambers. Treatment effects on visible injury, growth and yield were assessed after 49 (intermediate harvest) and 62 days of exposure (final harvest). The proportion of leaves with visible injury at final harvest increased with increasing concentrations of O3. Enhanced NH3 did not cause any symptoms and did not affect injury by O3. The estimated seasonal mean concentration corresponding with 5% injury was circa 23 nl litre(-1) O3. Biomass production and green pod yield decreased with increasing concentrations of O3 and were generally stimulated by enhanced NH3 at both harvests. Adverse effects of O3 on biomass and pod yield did not depend on the NH3 level. Relative yield response to increasing 9-h daily mean O3 concentrations was nonlinear and yield losses of 5 and 10% were calculated to occur at seasonal daytime mean concentrations of 27 and 33 nl litre(-1) O3, respectively. Linear regression showed that the Accumulated exposures Over a Threshold of 30 (AOT30) and 40 nl litre(-1) (AOT40) O3 performed equally well. The estimated accumulated O3 exposures corresponding with a yield loss of 5% were 1600 nl litre(-1) h for AOT30 and 400 nl litre(-1) h for AOT40. The results are discussed in relation to the long-term critical level that is used as a guideline to protect crops against adverse effects by O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop and Weed Science, DLO Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility, Wageningen, The Netherlands. a.e.g.tonneijck@ab.dlo.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tonneijck", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Dijk", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093328", "10.1016/s0269-7491(97)00178-4", "S0269749197001784"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
