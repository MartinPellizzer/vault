Pilot-scale ozone oxidation trials were performed on treated wastewater, before and after post-precipitation, over a seven-month period, including summer and winter months. Hydraulic retention times as short as 7\u00a0min were found to be sufficient for organic micropollutant removal. A short hydraulic retention time reduces both investment costs and land use. Neither the choice of ozone dispersion method, a static mixer or a Venturi injector, nor the wastewater temperature had any significant effect on the removal efficiency of organic micropollutants, however, higher removal was achieved after on-site post-precipitation with aluminum chloride."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
