In this study, we synthesized a series of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts by hydrothermal method changing the precursors and tested their activities at different relative humidity, gas volume space velocity of 150,000\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> and 5\u00a0ppm ozone. Remarkably, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-SO<sub>4</sub> prepared with MnSO<sub>4</sub> as precursor showed excellent catalytic ozone decomposition activity, almost completely converting 5\u00a0ppm of ozone at different relative humidity ranges. Finally, the most active Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-SO<sub>4</sub> catalyst was tested for its usability limit at RH=\u00a090%, after 28\u00a0h of testing under high humidity conditions, it had retained successfully the complete decomposition of low concentrations of ozone. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman, HRTEM, XPS, BET, H<sub>2</sub>O-TPD and in situ IR NH<sub>3</sub> adsorption. The characterization analysis revealed that the Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-SO<sub>4</sub> surface could exposed a highly active (101) crystalline surface with high specific surface area, excellent hydrophobicity as well as ozone adsorption capacity, which were highly favorable for ozone decomposition under high humidity conditions. In this work, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibits good catalytic activity, which provides an additional option for future studies of manganese oxides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
