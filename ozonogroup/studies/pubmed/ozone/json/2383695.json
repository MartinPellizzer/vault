The microporous poly(tetrafluoroethylene) tube was used as separator to transfer nitric oxide (reduced by iodine in acidic media) into a gas phase. Air-stripping was used to enhance the separation. Chemiluminescence signals produced from the reaction of nitric oxide with ozone were linearly proportional to the concentration of nitrite from 10 ppb (micrograms as N/L) to 5 ppm (mg N/L). The relative standard deviation (n = 5) was 0.7% at 0.1 ppm. The time elapse from starting the sample flow until the signal reached a stable level was 1.5 min."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry, College of Engineering, University of Osaka Prefecture, Sakai, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aoki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1C4QK22F9J", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Iodide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Iodide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2383695", "10.1002/bmc.1130040311"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
