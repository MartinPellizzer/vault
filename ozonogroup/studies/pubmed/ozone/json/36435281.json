We performed a small-area study in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), a high TB-burden area in rural China, using township-level (n\u00a0=\u00a0358 non-overlapping townships) annual TB notification data (2005-2017). We aimed to determine if annual average concentrations of ambient air pollution (particulate matter <2\u00b75\u00a0\u03bcm [PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>], nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>] ozone [O<sub>3</sub>]) were associated with TB notification rates (as a proxy for incidence). Air pollution effects on TB notification rates at township-level were estimated as incidence rate ratios (IRR), fitted using a generalised estimating equation (GEE) adjusted for covariates (age, sex, occupation, education, ethnicity, remoteness [urban or rural], household crowding and solid fuel use). A total of 38,942\u00a0TB notifications were reported in NHAR between 2005 and 2017. The mean annual TB notification rate was 67 (standard deviation [SD]; 7) per 100,000 people. Median concentrations of PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> were 42\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range [IQR]; 38-48\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), 15\u00a0ppb (IQR; 12-16\u00a0ppb), and 56\u00a0ppb (IQR; 56-57\u00a0ppb), respectively. In single pollutant models, adjusted for covariates, an interquartile range (IQR) increase (10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> was significantly associated with higher TB notification rates (IRR: 1\u221935; 95% CI: 1\u00b725-1\u00b748). Comparable effects on notifications of TB were observed for increases in NO<sub>2</sub> exposure (IRR: 1\u00b720 per IQR (4 ppb) increase; 95% CI: 1\u00b708-1\u00b731). Ground-level ozone was not associated with TB notification rate in any models. The observed effects were consistent over time, in multi-pollutant models, and appeared robust to additional adjustment for indicators of household crowding, solid fuel use and remoteness. More rigorous study designs are needed to understand if improving air quality has population-level benefits on TB disease incidence in endemic settings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
