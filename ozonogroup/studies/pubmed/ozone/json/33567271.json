Deep profiling of lipids across a range of prostate cancer cell lines reveals a variety of fatty acids with unusual site(s) of unsaturation that are not described by canonical pathways. The structure and abundance of these unusual lipids correlate with changes in desaturase expression and are strong indicators of cellular phenotype. Gene silencing and stable isotope tracing demonstrate that direct \u03946 and \u03948 desaturation of 14:0 (myristic), 16:0 (palmitic), and 18:0 (stearic) acids by FADS2 generate new families of unsaturated fatty acids (including n-8, n-10, and n-12) that have rarely-if ever-been reported in human-derived cells. Isomer-resolved lipidomics reveals the\u00a0selective incorporation of these unusual fatty acids into complex structural lipids and identifies their presence in cancer tissues, indicating functional roles in membrane structure and signaling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
