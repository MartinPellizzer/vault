Recently, there has been interest in the use of vapor- and gas-based treatments for decontamination of surfaces and rooms. We describe preliminary results for an ozone-based decontamination of surfaces seeded with a range of vegetative cells and spores of bacteria of clinical relevance. The efficacy of the approach for room sanitization was also assessed. The protocol included use of a quenching agent to rapidly reduce ozone concentrations to safe levels allowing treatment times of less than 1 h for the majority of organisms tested. Using bacteria seeded onto agar plates and solid surfaces, reductions in bacterial load of greater than 3 log values were recorded for a number of organisms including Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Application of the process in a 30 m3 room showed similar reductions in viable counts for these organisms and for Clostridium difficile spores. We suggest that the potential of this ozone-quench approach should be further evaluated for disinfection or decontamination of healthcare environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Manchester School of Medicine, Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moat", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cargill", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shone", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Upton", "ForeName": "Mathew", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Can J Microbiol. 2010 Apr;56(4):356-7. doi: 10.1139/w10-017", "PMID": "20453904"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Decontamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Infection Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19898532", "10.1139/w09-046", "w09-046"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
