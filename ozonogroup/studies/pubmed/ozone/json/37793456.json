The development of widely recognized policies for controlling O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes is urgent. This study aims to provide actionable and comprehensive suggestions for O<sub>3</sub> control policy development, with an emphasis on the precursor emission reductions. Here, we compared the impacts of different spatial scale reductions on a widespread O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode in eastern China by a state-of-the-art regional air quality model. We find that region-scale joint control (in >30 cities) is much more effective than city-scale sporadic reduction in reducing O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Sporadic controls only reduce the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> by \u223c1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in the controlled city, whereas regional controls lead to a MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> decrease of \u223c8\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in the controlled region. In addition, the emission reduction effectiveness increased by 2.6 times from <5 cities to >30 cities. Continuous reductions have a cumulative effect on the decrease of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>, showing the strongest effects within 24\u00a0h and diminishing after 48\u00a0h, which underscores the importance of reducing emissions 24\u00a0h prior to an episode. Moreover, the effect of control measures on MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> varies spatially depending on the ratio of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) (VOCs/NO<sub>x</sub>). Both the reductions of VOC and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions have a positive effect on the decrease of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in summer, but the effects of VOC reductions are 1.2 to 1.7 times higher than those of NO<sub>x</sub> reductions. The residential sector, due to its high VOCs/NO<sub>x</sub> emission ratio, exhibits the highest efficiency in the reduction of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Our results highlight the importance of regional joint control and synergistic reduction of VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> in eastern China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
