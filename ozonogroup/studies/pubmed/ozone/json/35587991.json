Here, we used a combination of chemical transport modeling, health benefit assessments, and machine learning to capture such OHBs and optimize O<sub>3</sub> mitigation pathways based on 121 control scenarios. We revealed that, for the China mainland, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surroundings (\"2 + 26\" cities), Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta, there could be at most 2897, 920, 1247, and 896 additional O<sub>3</sub>-related deaths in urban areas, respectively, accompanying 21,512, 3442, 5614, and 642 avoided O<sub>3</sub>-related deaths in rural areas, respectively, at the same control stage. Additionally, potential disbenefits during O<sub>3</sub> mitigation were \"pro-wealthy\", that is, residents in developed regions are more likely to afford additional health risks. In order to avoid OHBs during O<sub>3</sub> abatement, we proposed a two-phase control strategy, whereby the reduction ratio of NO<sub><i>X</i></sub> (nitrogen oxide) to VOCs (volatile organic compounds) was adjusted according to health benefit distribution patterns. Our study provided novel insights into China's O<sub>3</sub> attainment and references for other countries facing the dual challenges of environmental pollution and associated inequality issues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental & Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zeyuan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Air Quality Simulation and System Analysis, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Air Quality Simulation and System Analysis, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Planning and Policy Simulation, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Wenbo", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Air Quality Simulation and System Analysis, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yueqi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Air Quality Simulation and System Analysis, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xurong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3429-5754"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Air Quality Simulation and System Analysis, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yixuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental & Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qingyu", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2720-2473"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental & Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Planning and Policy Simulation, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jinnan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35587991", "10.1021/acs.est.2c00114"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
