Current [O<sub>3</sub>] has significantly reduced CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate (P<sub>n</sub>) by 33% and total biomass by 4% in comparison with low O<sub>3</sub> level (charcoal-filtered air, CF). Relative to CF, an increase in future [O<sub>3</sub>] would further enhance the reduction in total biomass by 24%, plant height by 17% and plant leaf area by 19%. Isoprene emissions could decline by 34% under e[O<sub>3</sub>], with feedback implications in reducing the formation of secondary air pollutants including O<sub>3</sub>. Reduced stomatal conductance and lower foliar area might increase runoff and freshwater availability in O<sub>3</sub> polluted areas. Higher cumulated O<sub>3</sub> exposure over a threshold of 40\u202fppb (AOT40) induced larger reductions in P<sub>n</sub>, total biomass and isoprene emission. Relationships of light-saturated photosynthesis rates (A<sub>sat</sub>), total biomass and chlorophyll content with AOT40 using a global dataset are provided. These relationships are expected to improve O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment and also to support the inclusion of the effect of O<sub>3</sub> in models addressing plantation productivity and carbon sink capacity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
