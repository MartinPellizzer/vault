The reaction time for mixtures of alkenes with ozone or nitrogen dioxide was 40 minutes, and the exposure time for bacteria was 6 hours. Ozone gave rise to a small mutagenic effect in combination with 1,3-butadiene or vinyl chloride, with and without ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, but not in combination with ethene or propene. Nitrogen dioxide gave rise to a mutagenic effect in combination with propene, 1,3-butadiene, or vinyl chloride, but only after UV irradiation. The mutagenic activity was highest with butadiene and seemed to be dose-related to the concentration of nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide with ethene did not produce a mutagenic effect. A mixture of ethene, propene, and butadiene, tested with ozone or nitrogen dioxide with UV irradiation, did not potentiate each other's mutagenic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Medicine, Department of Toxicology, Stockholm, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Victorin", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "St\u00e5hlberg", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WD06X94M2D", "NameOfSubstance": "Vinyl Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vinyl Chloride"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3276509", "10.1002/em.2850110109"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
