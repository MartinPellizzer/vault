However, in some instances, microorganisms contribute to contaminant degradation without any apparent benefit for themselves. Such cometabolism plays an important part in bioremediation, but is often difficult to control. Microbial degradation of tetrachloromethane (carbon tetrachloride, CCl(4)), a toxic ozone-depleting organic solvent mainly of anthropogenic origin, is only known to occur by cometabolic reduction under anoxic conditions. Yet no microbial system capable of using CCl(4) as the sole carbon source has been described. Microbial growth based on CCl(4) as a terminal electron acceptor has not been reported, although corresponding degradation pathways would yield sufficient energy. Known modes for the biodegradation of CCl(4) involve several microbial metabolites, mainly metal-bound coenzymes and siderophores, which are produced by facultative or strictly anaerobic bacteria and methanogenic Archaea. Recent reports have demonstrated that CCl(4) dechlorination rates are enhanced by redox-active organic compounds such as humic acids and quinones, which act as shuttles between electron-providing microorganisms and CCl(4) as a strong electron acceptor. The key factors underlying dechlorination of CCl(4), the practical aspects and specific requirements for microorganism-associated degradation of CCl(4) at contaminated sites and perspectives for future developments are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Journal compilation \u00a9 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
