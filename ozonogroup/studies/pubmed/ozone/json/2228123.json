To identify genotoxic compounds in urban air, micromutagenesis methods are coupled to analytical fractionation and new chemical characterization methods. Among polar mutagenic compounds, many appeared to be nitrated and or oxygenated aromatic compounds. Source apportionment of the mutagenic activity observed in urban air shows that vehicles and residential heating are major contributors to the ambient mutagenicity of the aerosol fraction. Comparative tumorigenesis and DNA adduct dosimetry studies are also being conducted with these same combustion emission sources and urban aerosols. The potential hazard and sources of the gaseous emissions have not been determined, but appear to be significantly increased by atmospheric transformation by ozone and nitrogen oxides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, Genetic Toxicology Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lewtas", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallagher", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "IARC Sci Publ", "NlmUniqueID": "8009542", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5038"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}], "NumberOfReferences": "32"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2228123"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
