The aim of future studies will be to predict the breakthrough behavior of waterworks filters in the same way as discussed here. This seems to be fairly simple if the filters are working with adsorption only. If, in addition, biological processes occur in a filter (as is generally observed), these processes have to be taken into account because an additional mechanism exists for removal of organic substances in the activated carbon filter. Investigations in a new research program will also need to consider the influence of ozone on biodegradation. Use of the methods already discussed, can help to optimize existing plants, as well as a proper control of the efficiency of the regeneration processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baldauf", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3694472"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
