Current surface modification methods via ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) and/or O<sub>2</sub> plasma, atomic layer deposition (ALD), plasmas deposition, and chemical treatment impart a dense polymer or inorganic layer on the surface that is brittle and easy to fracture at low strain levels. This paper presents a new method, based on gel-liquid infiltration polymerization, to form hybrid skin layers atop elastomers. The method is unique in that it allows for control of the skin layer topography, with tunable feature sizes and aspect ratios as high as 1.8 without fracture. Unlike previous techniques, the skin layer formed here dramatically improves the barrier properties of the elastomer, while preserving skin layer flexibility. Moreover, the method is versatile and likely applicable to most interfacial polymerization systems and network polymers on flat and patterned surfaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Engineering Program, University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder, Colorado 80309-0596, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder, Colorado 80309-0427, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mengyuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Measurement Science Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) , Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, United States."}], "LastName": "Gorham", "ForeName": "Justin M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Chemicals and Materials Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) , Boulder, Colorado 80305, United States."}], "LastName": "Killgore", "ForeName": "Jason P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York , Buffalo, New York 14260, United States."}], "LastName": "Omidvar", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8042-154X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York , Buffalo, New York 14260, United States."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Haiqing", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Chemicals and Materials Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) , Boulder, Colorado 80305, United States."}], "LastName": "DelRio", "ForeName": "Frank W", "Initials": "FW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5830-3819"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Chemicals and Materials Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) , Boulder, Colorado 80305, United States."}], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "Lewis M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Functional Nanomaterials, Brookhaven National Laboratory , Upton, New York 11973-5000, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7779-7781"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Engineering Program, University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder, Colorado 80309-0596, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder, Colorado 80309-0427, United States."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Yifu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28758394", "10.1021/acsami.7b09274"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
