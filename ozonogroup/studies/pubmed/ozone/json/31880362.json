Ozone has been applied for protecting I/R injury in animal models of several organs including cerebra, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and lactate dehydrogenase measurement were used to determine the influence of ozone on cell activity and damage of SH-SY5Y cells. Some redox items such as catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8<sub>m</sub> ) was determined by JC-1 assay. Cytochrome-c (cyt-c) level in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion was measured by western blotting. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, and some apoptosis-related molecules were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Ozone alleviated oxidative damage by increasing GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, and decreasing MDA. Ozone decreased mitochondrial damage caused by I/R injury and inhibited the release of cyt-c from mitochondrion to cytoplasm in SH-SY5Y cells. The cell apoptosis caused by I/R was inhibited by ozone, and ozone could decrease apoptosis by increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and inhibiting caspase signaling pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. Ozone has the ability of maintaining redox homeostasis, decreasing mitochondrion damage, and inhibiting neurocytes apoptosis induced by I/R. Therefore, ozone may be a promising protective strategy against cerebral I/R injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 International Federation for Cell Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitative Medicine, Laboratory of Sports Medicine, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital and The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University, Changsha, 410016, P.R.
