However, a widely used biomaterial such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) suffers from high biofouling activity and hydrophobic recovery that results in decreased efficiency and stability. A current challenge is to modify and fabricate self-cleaning PDMS surfaces by incorporating antifouling and pH-sensitive properties. To address this, we synthesized a zwitterionic and pH-sensitive random poly(glycidyl methacrylate- co-sulfobetaine methacrylate- co-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) polymer, poly(GMA- co-SBMA- co-DMAEMA). In this work, chemical modification of PDMS was done by grafting onto poly(GMA- co-SBMA- co-DMAEMA) after surface activation via UV and ozone for 90 min to ensure the formation of covalent bonds necessary for stable grafting. The PDMS grafted with G20-S40-D40 exhibit antifouling and pH-sensitive properties by mitigating fibrinogen adsorption, blood cell adhesion, and releasing 98% adhered E. coli bacteria after immersion at basic pH. The grafting of poly(GMA- co-SBMA- co-DMAEMA) presented in this work shows attractive potential for biomedical and industrial applications as a simple, smart, and effective method for the modification of PDMS interfaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Center for Membrane Technology and Department of Chemical Engineering , Chung Yuan Christian University , Chung-Li , Taoyuan 320 , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical, Biological and Materials Engineering and Sciences , Mapua University , Intramuros, Muralla St. , Manila 1002 , Philippines."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Vera", "ForeName": "Jacqueline S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Center for Membrane Technology and Department of Chemical Engineering , Chung Yuan Christian University , Chung-Li , Taoyuan 320 , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0383-695X"], "LastName": "Venault", "ForeName": "Antoine", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Center for Membrane Technology and Department of Chemical Engineering , Chung Yuan Christian University , Chung-Li , Taoyuan 320 , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "Ying-Nien", "Initials": "YN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical, Biological and Materials Engineering and Sciences , Mapua University , Intramuros, Muralla St. , Manila 1002 , Philippines."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tayo", "ForeName": "Lemmuel", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Urology, Department of Surgery , Changhua Christian Hospital , 135 Nanxian St. , Changhua 500 , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Heng-Chieh", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Chimique , Universit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier , 118 route de Narbonne , 31062 Toulouse Cedex 9, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aimar", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Center for Membrane Technology and Department of Chemical Engineering , Chung Yuan Christian University , Chung-Li , Taoyuan 320 , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1419-4478"], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yung", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30089354", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b01569"]}}]}
