We have used the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trapping technique to search for free radicals produced in vivo by ozone exposure. The spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN) was administered ip to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were then exposed for 2 hr to either 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 ppm ozone with 8% CO2 to increase their respiratory rate. A six-line 4-POBN/radical spin adduct signal (aN = 15.02 G and a beta H = 3.27 G) was detected by EPR spectroscopy in lipid extracts from lungs of rats treated with 4-POBN and then exposed to ozone. Only a weak signal was observed in the corresponding solution from rats exposed to 0 ppm ozone (air with CO2 only). The concentration of the radical adduct increased as a function of ozone concentration. After administration of 4-POBN, rats were exposed for either 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 hr to either 0 or 2.0 ppm ozone (with CO2). The radical adduct concentration of the ozone-exposed groups at exposure times of 2.0 and 4.0 hr was significantly different from that of the corresponding air control groups. A correlation was observed between the radical adduct concentration and the lung weight/body weight ratio. These results demonstrate that ozone induces the production of free radicals in rat lungs during inhalation exposure and that radical production may be involved in the induction of pulmonary toxicity by ozone. This is the first direct evidence for ozone-induced free radical production in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kennedy", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hatch", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slade", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mason", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "5T32 ES-07126", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spin Labels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spin Labels"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1316646", "10.1016/0041-008x(92)90094-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
