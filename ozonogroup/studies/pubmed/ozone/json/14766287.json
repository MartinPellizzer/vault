The isolated double bond of cholesterol has been shown to be susceptible to attack by ozone, but the major reaction product from cholesterol ozonolysis had been remarkably difficult to structurally characterize. Recently, NMR and X-ray crystallography have been used to suggest the formation of a hydroperoxy, hydroxy hemiacetal product, using various derivatives and models of cholesterol to stabilize this chemically reactive product. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to study the somewhat unstable ozonolysis product of cholesterol which was found to display unique ionization and fragmentation properties when collisionally activated. The electron-deficient carbon atoms of this highly oxygenated product permitted covalent attachment of an acetate anion during negative ion electrospray ionization, leading to the formation of abundant adduct ions at m/z 511. Surprisingly, positive ions were not readily formed. Collision induced dissociation of the adduct anion yielded a major ion at m/z 477, corresponding to the loss of hydrogen peroxide. The most abundant fragment ion following collisional activation was observed at m/z 93, resulting from a complex rearrangement subsequent to the attack of the hydroperoxide anion on the carbon center of the acetate adduct. Based on the interpretation of the tandem mass spectral data, the major cholesterol ozonization product was characterized as a hydroperoxy, hydroxy hemiacetal derivative, which was consistent with the NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies which were carried out on the more stable methyl ether derivative."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Cell Biology, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80206, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pulfer", "ForeName": "Melissa K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harrison", "ForeName": "Kathleen", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "Robert C", "Initials": "RC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES012347", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL34303", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Soc Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9010412", "ISSNLinking": "1044-0305"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "5-hydroperoxy-B-homo-6-oxa-cholestane-3beta,7-diol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholestanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cholestanols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Free Radic Biol Med. 1995 Dec;19(6):935-41", "ArticleIdList": ["8582671"]}, {"Citation": "Steroids. 1996 Jul;61(7):401-6", "ArticleIdList": ["8837291"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Physiol. 1998 Jun;274(6 Pt 1):L1006-16", "ArticleIdList": ["9609740"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1996 Mar;153(3):904-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8630571"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 28;278(13):11190-6", "ArticleIdList": ["12547823"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Biochem Physiol. 1959 Aug;37(8):911-7", "ArticleIdList": ["13671378"]}, {"Citation": "Pure Appl Chem. 1970;21(2):205-25", "ArticleIdList": ["5458817"]}, {"Citation": "J Org Chem. 1967 Apr;32(4):1005-12", "ArticleIdList": ["6042134"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1992 Jan;112(1):64-72", "ArticleIdList": ["1733049"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1999 Mar;159(3):776-84", "ArticleIdList": ["10051250"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14766287", "10.1016/j.jasms.2003.10.011", "S1044030503007669"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
