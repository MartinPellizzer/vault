For this purpose synthetic triacylglycerols of known structure were converted to hydroperoxides, hydroxides, epoxides, and core aldehydes and their dinitrophenylhydrazones by published procedures. The oxotriacylglycerols were resolved by normal-phase thin-layer chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, and the identities of the oxotriacylglycerols confirmed by LC/ES/MS. Elution factors of oxotriacylglycerols were determined in relation to a homologous series of saturated triacylglycerols, ranging from 24 to 54 acyl carbons, and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC, using a gradient of 20-80% isopropanol in methanol as eluting solvent and an evaporative light-scattering detector. It was shown that the elution times varied with the nature of the functional group and its regiolocation in the triacylglycerol molecule. A total of 31 incremental elution factors were calculated from chromatography of 33 oxygenated and nonoxygenated triacylglycerol species, ranging in carbon number from 36 to 54 and in double-bond number from 0 to 6."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Banting and Best Department of Medical Research, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sj\u00f6vall", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuksis", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marai", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myher", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lipids", "NlmUniqueID": "0060450", "ISSNLinking": "0024-4201"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0RBV727H71", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Linolenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9KJL21T0QJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Linoleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ND2M416302", "NameOfSubstance": "2-Propanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "2-Propanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Linoleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Linolenic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Lipids. 1992 Nov;27(11):933-9", "ArticleIdList": ["1491614"]}, {"Citation": "J Biochem Biophys Methods. 1995 Nov;30(4):271-85", "ArticleIdList": ["8621886"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Chem. 1991 Sep 1;63(17 ):1781-8", "ArticleIdList": ["1789441"]}, {"Citation": "Lipids. 1971 Oct;6(10):734-9", "ArticleIdList": ["27519207"]}, {"Citation": "Lipids. 1995 Apr;30(4):277-90", "ArticleIdList": ["7609594"]}, {"Citation": "Methods Enzymol. 1990;186:407-21", "ArticleIdList": ["2233308"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Biochem Cell Biol. 1983 Aug;61(8):840-9", "ArticleIdList": ["6684982"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1989 Feb 15;158(3):1021-8", "ArticleIdList": ["2920033"]}, {"Citation": "Methods Enzymol. 1981;72:21-34", "ArticleIdList": ["7311832"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9397407", "10.1007/s11745-997-0155-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
