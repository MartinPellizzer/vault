However, the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and its driving mechanism are complex and need to be further analyzed. We analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in the \"2\u00a0+\u00a026\" cities from 2015 to 2021, and quantified the influence of meteorological factors and anthropogenic emissions and their interactions on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations based on geographic detector model. We find the inter-annual and inter-season PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations show downward trend from 2015 to 2021, and the inter-month PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations present a U-shaped distribution. The PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in the \"2\u00a0+\u00a026\" cities manifest a spatial distribution pattern of high in the south and low in the north, and high in the middle and low in the surroundings. Meteorological conditions have stronger effects on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations than anthropogenic emissions, and planetary boundary layer height and temperature are the two main driving factors at the annual scale. On the seasonal scale, sunshine duration is the dominant factor of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in summer and autumn, and planetary boundary layer height is the dominant factor of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in winter. The effect of anthropogenic emissions on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration is higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn, and ammonia and ozone have stronger effects on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations than other anthropogenic emissions. Interactions between the factors significantly enhance the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. The interactions between planetary boundary layer height and other impacting factors play dominant roles on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at annual scale and in winter. Our results not only provide crucial information for further developing air quality policies of the \"2\u00a0+\u00a026\" cities, but also bear out several important implications for clean air policies in China and other regions of the world."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
