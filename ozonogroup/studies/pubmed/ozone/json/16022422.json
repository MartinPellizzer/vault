We tested such a hypothesis by outdoor captive-air irradiation (CAI) experiments in the two largest Mexican metropolitan areas: Guadalajara (GMA) in 1997 and Mexico City (MCMA) in 2000. O3 was monitored in each city for 20 days (8:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.) in smog chambers containing unaltered morning air or morning air enriched with either commercial LPG or LPG synthetic mixture 60/40 (propane and butane). Tested additions of both components were 35% (by volume) in GMA and 60% (by volume) in MCMA. The addition effects on O3 (max) were compared with effects from diluting LPG components or total nonmethane hydrocarbons (tNMHCs) by 50%. Diluting tNMHCs had the greatest absolute effect at both cities: it lowered O3 (max) by 24% in GMA and 55% in MCMA. Adding commercial LPG increased O3 (max) by 6% in GMA and 28% in MCMA; whereas adding LPG synthetic mixture 60/40 caused a similar increase in O3 (max), 4 and 21% in GMA and MCMA, respectively. Compared with dilution of tNMHCs, dilution of LPG-associated compounds had a smaller decreasing effect on O3 (max), only 4% in GMA and 15% in MCMA. These results show that commercial LPG and LPG synthetic mixture 60/40 affect O3 formation to a lesser extent than estimated previously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Programa de Investigaci\u00f3n en Medio Ambiente y Seguridad, Direcci\u00f3n Ejecutiva de Investigaci\u00f3n, Instituto Mexicano del Petr\u00f3leo, Mexico City, Mexico. jjaimes@imp.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaimes-L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "J Luis", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandoval-Fern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Julio", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Ort\u00edz", "ForeName": "Emmanuel", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "V\u00e1zquez-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Marcos", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Mac\u00edas", "ForeName": "Uriel", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zambrano-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Angel", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16022422", "10.1080/10473289.2005.10464667"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
