Then, half of groups were incubated with 30 \u03bcg/mL ozone for 25 min as combination groups. Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay, apoptosis by flow cytometry, and levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and MMP-9 by immunocytochemistry.", "Doxorubicin + ozone treatment enhanced viability of L929 (p<0.01) but reduced viability of MCF-7 compared to only doxorubicin-applied cells without ozone treatment (p<0.001). This combined treatment also enhanced apoptotic effect of doxorubicin on MCF-cells (p<0.001), but not on L929. It significantly increased all protein levels of L929 compared with those of other groups (p<0.05 for tumor necrosis factor alpha and MMP-2; p<0.01 for transforming growth factor beta and MMP-9). This treatment reversed the effect of doxorubicin on tumor necrosis factor alpha levels and considerably reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels of MCF-7 compared with those of control group (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively).", "Ozone treatment potentiated the apoptotic and anticancer activities of doxorubicin in MCF-7 cells and showed repairing and healing effect on healthy fibroblast cells, which were damaged from cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agent. MCF-7 cells may acquire sensitivity against the doxorubicin combined with ozone treatment through activating tumor necrosis factor alpha, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expressions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1575-5751"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Health and Sciences, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Department of General Surgery - Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karagulle", "ForeName": "Onur Olgac", "Initials": "OO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6424-7411"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istanbul Health and Technology University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biochemistry - Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yurttas", "ForeName": "Asiye Gok", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992)", "NlmUniqueID": "9308586", "ISSNLinking": "0104-4230"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35649075", "10.1590/1806-9282.20211193", "S0104-42302022000400507"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
