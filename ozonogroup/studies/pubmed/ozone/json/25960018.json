Tai, Mt. Hua, and Mt. Huang in 2004 were quantified. It was found that the CEC anthropogenic sources influenced the air masses and the associated ozone production most at Mt. Tai, located at the center of CEC domain. At Mt. Hua to the west of CEC domain and at Mt. Huang to the south of CEC domain, the air masses and the associated ozone production showed less CEC anthropogenic influences on a regional scale. At Mt. Tai and Mt. Huang, the ozone mixing ratios in the air masses that passed over polluted source regions in CEC increased during the first 40-70 h after arrival and showed the highest production rate of 31.2 and 12.2 ppb/day, respectively, in May and June. It was estimated that the CEC anthropogenic sources contributed 34-42% of ozone at Mt. Tai and 8-14% at Mt. Huang during this ozone peak season. The large contributions from CEC sources during fall season (Sep-Nov) were also estimated as 31-44 and 17-23% but with the lower ozone production rate of 22.6 and 8.4 ppb/day, respectively, for Mt. Tai and Mt. Huang."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Development Administration, National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA), 118 Serithai Rd., Klongchan, Bangkapi, Bangkok, 10240, Thailand, pakpong.pochanart@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Pochanart", "ForeName": "Pakpong", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 2003 Dec 5;302(5651):1716-9", "ArticleIdList": ["14657488"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2005 Sep 1;437(7055):129-32", "ArticleIdList": ["16136141"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2014 Mar;21(5):3873-9", "ArticleIdList": ["24288059"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2014 Nov 15;499:154-65", "ArticleIdList": ["25181047"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25960018", "10.1007/s11356-015-4642-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
