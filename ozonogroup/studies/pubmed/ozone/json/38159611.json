The application of particular sizes, shapes, and concentration of nanomaterials (NMs) potentially mitigate the negative impacts in plants by modulation of photosynthetic rate, redox homeostasis, hormonal balance, and nutrient assimilation through upregulation of anti-stress metabolites, antioxidant defense pathways, and genes and genes network. The present review inculcates recent advances in uptake, translocation, and accumulation mechanisms of NMs in plants. The critical theme of this review provides detailed insights into different physiological, biochemical, molecular, and stress tolerance mechanism(s) of NMs action and their cross-talk with different phytohormones. The role of NMs as a double-edged sword for climate change factors, abiotic, and biotic stresses for nutrients uptake, hormones synthesis, cytotoxic, and genotoxic effects including chromosomal aberration, and micronuclei synthesis have been extensively studied. Importantly, this review aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the hormesis effect at low and toxicity at higher doses of NMs under different stressors to develop innovative approaches and design smart NMs for sustainable crop production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
