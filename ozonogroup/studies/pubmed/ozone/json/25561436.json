To achieve this, Ni-doped Sb-SnO2 (NSS) was deposited on one side of a titanium (Ti) foil while the other side was anodized to grow a TiO2 nanotube array (TNA) for electrochemical ozone generation and photoelectrochemical hydroxyl radical generation, respectively. Surface characterization indicated that NSS and TNA were formed and spatially separated yet electrically connected through the Ti substrate. While each catalyst possessed unique electrochemical properties, the coupling of both catalysts resulted in mixed electrochemical properties that drove electrocatalysis at high potentials and photoelectrocatalysis at low potentials. The performance of the NSS/TNA electrode for phenol decomposition was \u223c3 times greater than that of single-layer catalysts and \u223c1.5 times greater than the combined catalytic performances of the individual NSS and TNA catalysts. This synergistic effect was attributed partly to the simultaneous generation of hydroxyl radicals and ozone, followed by the production of other ROS. A mechanism for the generation of ROS was discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy Engineering, Kyungpook National University , Daegu 702-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "So Young", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Wonyong", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Hyunwoong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25561436", "10.1021/am5076748"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
