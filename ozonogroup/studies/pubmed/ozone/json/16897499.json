Trends in the annual ozone mean, 95th and 25th percentiles were determined as statistically not significant at Preila and Rugsteliskes sites during the 1994-2004 period. Trends in the ozone concentration and its percentiles in the air masses arriving to Preila station in \"polluted\" and \"unpolluted\" sectors have been examined. Statistically significant changes in the ozone annual mean and 25th percentile were found in air masses in both \"polluted\" and \"unpolluted\" sectors in the 1988-2002 period. The trend analysis in the ozone monthly mean and percentiles for each month of the year revealed the main changes in the ozone level in both sectors during January-May. Insignificant downward trends in monthly 95th percentile in \"unpolluted\" sector and upward trends in \"polluted\" sector were found during summer months. Values of AOT40 for the protection of forests as well as crops and semi-natural vegetation were determined during the 1994-2004 period. The estimated AOT40 values for the protection of forests were lower than the critical level at Lithuanian rural sites but AOT40 values for the protection of crops and semi-natural vegetation were found to be higher than the critical level at both sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physics, Savanoriu 231, LT, 02300, Vilnius, Lithuania. raseleg@ktl.mii.lt"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Girgzdiene", "ForeName": "Rasa", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bycenkiene", "ForeName": "Svetlana", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Girgzdys", "ForeName": "Aloyzas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lithuania"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1999;100(1-3):43-55", "ArticleIdList": ["15093112"]}, {"Citation": "Ambio. 2005 Feb;34(1):47-53", "ArticleIdList": ["15789518"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1959 Jan 23;129(3343):208-10", "ArticleIdList": ["17808689"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16897499", "10.1007/s10661-006-9283-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
