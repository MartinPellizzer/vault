A pilot plant with ozonation and subsequent biological treatment in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was thus operated over 16\u00a0months to investigate the removal of micropollutants and the formation and removal of N-oxide transformation products. Lab-scale kinetic experiments were performed in parallel. At a moderate ozone dose of 0.5\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub> g<sup>-1</sup> DOC, further degradation of gabapentin and 3 iodinated contrast media (iomeprol, iopamidol, and iohexol) could be induced by the biofilm at prolonged exposure times. To facilitate comparison of feeding regimens in biofilm systems a new surface-related degradation rate constant was introduced. The availability of substrates in the pilot MBBR influenced the micropollutant degradation kinetics with increasing and decreasing degradation rates. N-oxides from erythromycin, clarithromycin, tramadol, and venlafaxine were formed during ozonation and could not be degraded by the biofilm."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
