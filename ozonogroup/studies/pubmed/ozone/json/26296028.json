These ultrahigh vacuum studies provide direct infrared spectroscopic evidence for the formation and decomposition of a primary ozonide of C60. The spectral assignments of this highly unstable intermediate have been verified using electronic structure calculations. Theory and experiment revealed that C60 oxidized nearly exclusively via addition of ozone across the double bond that links two six-carbon-containing rings of the molecule. Following spectral characterization, the initial probability for ozone to react with the surface was found to be 5.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10(-4). Once formed, the ozonide quickly thermally decomposed to a variety of carbonyl-containing products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, U.S. Army, Edgewood, Maryland 21010, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Erin Durke", "Initials": "ED"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "Alec", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McEntee", "ForeName": "Monica", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Manpreet", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Troya", "ForeName": "Diego", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morris", "ForeName": "John R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101526034", "ISSNLinking": "1948-7185"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26296028", "10.1021/jz3012518"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
