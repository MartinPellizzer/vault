We investigated iodine-containing particles (0.2-2 \u03bcm) in the Arctic Ocean using a ship-based single particle aerosol mass spectrometer from July to August 2017. Seven main particle types were identified: dust, biomass combustion particles, sea salt, organic S, aromatics, hydrocarbon-like compounds, and amines. The number fraction of iodine-containing particles was higher inside the Arctic Circle (>65\u00b0N) than outside (55-65\u00b0N). According to the air mass back trajectories, the latitudinal distribution of iodine-containing particles can be mainly attributed to iodine emissions from the sea ice edge region. Diurnal trends were found, especially during the second half of cruise, with peak iodine-containing particle number fractions during low-light conditions and relatively low number fractions at midday. These results imply that solar radiation plays a significant role in modulating particulate iodine in the Arctic atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
