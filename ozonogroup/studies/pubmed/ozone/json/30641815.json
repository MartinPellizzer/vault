This problem can lead to morbidity and even mortality. Ozone is a gas that can optimize cellular metabolism and, because of its antioxidant and antibacterial effects, can help the better healing of diabetic foot ulcer.", "Two hundred patients, aged 18-85 with diabetic foot ulcers ranging from grade 1 to 4 according to Wagner classification in two groups were studied. Group 1 was treated by full ozone therapy besides the standard regular DFU treatment while group two just was received routine diabetic foot care. Wound size, wound grade, healing time, Fasting blood sugar and inflammatory biomarker before and after treatment were checked.", "All patients have had complete wound closure in the ozone group. The mean age of the patients included in the results was 59.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.593 and 53.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.212 for ozone group and control group. The baseline average surface area of ulcers was 13.41\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.092\u202fcm<sup>2</sup> (range 1-70\u202fcm<sup>2</sup>) in ozone group and 12.72\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.911 (range 1_64\u202fcm<sup>2</sup>) in the control group. Average healing time was 69.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f36.055 days (range 15-180 days), which is significantly lower than the median healing time measured in the control group and some previous studies.", "Our study results support the efficacy of ozone therapy especially in its comprehensive use in DFU healing and reduction in the chances of infection and amputation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Diabetes India.
