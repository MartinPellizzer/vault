Valencia oranges were continuously exposed to 0.3 \u00b1 0.05 ppm(vol/vol) ozone at 5\u00b0C for 4 weeks. Eureka lemons were exposed to an intermittent day-night ozone cycle (0.3 \u00b1 0.01 ppm ozone only at night) in a commercial cold storage room at 4.5\u00b0C for 9 weeks. Both oranges and lemons were continuously exposed to 1.0 \u00b1 0.05 ppm ozone at 10\u00b0C in an export container for 2 weeks. Exposure to ozone did not reduce final incidence of green or blue mold, although incidence of both diseases was delayed about 1 week and infections developed more slowly under ozone. Sporulation was prevented or reduced by gaseous ozone without noticeable ozone phytotoxicity to the fruit. A synergistic effect between ozone exposure and low temperature was observed for prevention of sporulation. The proliferation of spores of fungicide-resistant strains of these pathogens, which often develop during storage, may be delayed, presumably prolonging the useful life of postharvest fungicides. In vitro radial growth of P. italicum, but not of P. digitatum, during a 5-day incubation period at 20\u00b0C was significantly reduced by a previous 0.3 \u00b1 0.05 ppm ozone exposure at 5\u00b0C for 4 days. Inoculum density did not influence the effect of gaseous ozone on decay incidence or severity on oranges exposed to 0.3 \u00b1 0.05 ppm ozone at 20\u00b0C for 1 week. Susceptibility of oranges to decay was not affected by a previous continuous exposure to 0.3 \u00b1 0.05 ppm ozone at 20\u00b0C for 1 week. A corona discharge ozone generator was effective in abating ethylene in an empty export container."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Pomology, University of California, Davis, Kearney Agricultural Center, 9240 South Riverbend Ave., Parlier, CA 93648."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palou", "ForeName": "Llu\u00eds", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Horticultural Crops Research Laboratory, USDA-ARS, 2021 South Peach Ave., Fresno, CA 93727."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smilanick", "ForeName": "Joseph L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Pomology, University of California, Davis, Kearney Agricultural Center, 9240 South Riverbend Ave., Parlier, CA 93648."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crisosto", "ForeName": "Carlos H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture, Menofiya University, Shebin El-Kom, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansour", "ForeName": "Monir", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30823031", "10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.6.632"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
