Ozone, HONO, HCHO and H2O2 which are regarded as the sources of .OH and other atmospheric components were measured. Mixing ratios of O3, HCHO, HONO and H2O2 were determined to be 4.96 x 10(-8), 3.97 x 10(-10), 2. 53 x 10(-10) and 1.18 x 10(10) respectively, which were lower than the previous observation at the rural areas in Northern China. Using CMAQ, the contribution factors to the .OH of O3, HCHO, HONO, and H2O2 were calculated to be 57.0%, 7.7%, 34.9% and 0.4% respectively. The photolysis of O3 was the most important source of OH radicals in the atmosphere. The contribution factors of O3, HCHO, and H2O2 had a single peak during 12:00-13:00 local time. For HONO, the contribution factor showed fluctuations during the daytime, unlike the human living environment in which it peaked in the morning."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China. liuhao_pku@pku.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui-xiang", "Initials": "HX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24288975"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
