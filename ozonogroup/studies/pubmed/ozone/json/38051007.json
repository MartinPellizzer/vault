Smoke days, which were identified by a combination of overhead satellite smoke detection and surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> data and accounted for approximately 9% of the total number of days, exhibited O<sub>3</sub> levels 6.8 to 8.9 ppb higher than no-smoke days and were predominantly characterized by high daily maximum temperatures and low relative humidity. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was developed to quantify the impact of wildfire contributions to O<sub>3</sub>. The GAM, which provides smooth functions that make the interpretation of relationships more intuitive, employed 17 predictors and demonstrated reliable performance in various evaluation metrics. The mean of the residuals for all sites was approximately zero for the training and cross-validation data and 5.1 ppb for smoke days. We developed three approaches to estimate the contribution of smoke to O<sub>3</sub> from the model residuals. These generate a minimum and maximum contribution for each smoke day. The average of the minimum and maximum wildfire contributions to O<sub>3</sub> for the SLC sites was 5.1 and 8.5 ppb, respectively. Between 2006 and 2022, an increasing trend in the wildfire contributions to O<sub>3</sub> was observed in SLC. Moreover, trends of the fourth-highest MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> before and after removing the wildfire contributions to O<sub>3</sub> at the SLC Hawthorne site in 2006-2022 were quite different. Whereas the unadjusted data do not meet the current O<sub>3</sub> standard, after removing the contributions from wildfires the SLC region is close to achieving levels that are consistent with meeting the O<sub>3</sub> standard. We also found that the wildfire contribution during smoke days was particularly high under conditions of high temperature, high PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration, and low cloud fraction.<i>Implications</i>: In this study, we quantified the impact of wildfires on maximum daily 8-hr average ozone concentrations (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) in Salt Lake City, Utah, using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The GAM results demonstrate the importance of wildfires as contributors to O<sub>3</sub> air pollution. Our results suggest that states could use the GAM approach to assist in quantifying the wildfire contribution to MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> under the U.S. EPA exceptional events rule. These findings also highlight the need for strategies to manage wildfires and their subsequent impacts on air quality in an era of climate warming."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0001-2045-8532"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, University of Washington, Bothell, WA, USA."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Haebum", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, University of Washington, Bothell, WA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}], "LastName": "Jaffe", "ForeName": "Daniel A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wildfires"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38051007", "10.1080/10962247.2023.2291197"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
