Hence, methods for cyanotoxin removal are required to confront seasonal or local incidences to sustain the safety of potable water reservoirs. Non-thermal plasmas provide the possibility for an environmentally benign treatment which can be adapted to specific concentrations and environmental conditions without the need of additional chemicals. We therefore investigated the potential of two different non-thermal plasma approaches for CYN degradation, operated either in a water mist, i.e. in air, or submerged in water. A degradation efficacy of 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00\u00a0g kWh<sup>-1</sup> L<sup>-1</sup> was found for a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) operated in air, while a submerged pulsed corona-like discharge resulted in an efficacy of 0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0g kWh<sup>-1</sup> L<sup>-1</sup>. CYN degradation followed a pseudo zeroth order or pseudo first order reaction kinetic, respectively. Treatment efficacy of the corona-like discharge submerged in water increased with pH values of the initial solution changing from 5.0 to 7.5. Notably, a pH-depending residual oxidative effect was observed for the submerged discharge, resulting in ongoing CYN degradation, even without further plasma treatment. In this case hydroxyl radicals were identified as the dominant oxidants of CYN at acidic pH values. In comparison, degradation by the DBD could be related primarily to the generation of ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
