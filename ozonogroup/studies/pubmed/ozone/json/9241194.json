The ozone in the stratosphere has been degraded by the chloride and bromide radicals which are produced from chlorofluorocarbons and bromofluorocarbons, respectively. However, we believe that fluorine also was related to the ozone degradation. The fluoride was introduced onto the activated carbon surface by tetrafluoromethane plasma treatment. The breakthrough curve of ozone onto PT-AC was measured to elucidate the relationship between the ozone and the fluoride. The amount of ozone adsorbed/degraded onto the PT-AC was larger than the amount that was adsorbed/degraded onto the untreated activated carbon. The amount of fluoride ion eluted from the PT-AC before the adsorption/degradation of ozone was larger than that which eluted after the adsorption/degradation of ozone. These results indicated that the ozone was degraded by the fluoride on the PT-AC surface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kinki University, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, 577, Japan"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanada", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawasaki", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohue", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torii", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Colloid Interface Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0043125", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9797"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9241194", "10.1006/jcis.1997.4902", "CS974902"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
