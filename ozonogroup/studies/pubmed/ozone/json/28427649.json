In this research, humic acid was used as a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in drinking water (up to 3mgL<sup>-1</sup>). The efficiency of DOC removal was studied by applying O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV and O<sub>3</sub>/UV advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) alone and combined with hybrid hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), generated by an orifice plate, as this technology recently shows promising potential for the treatment of water, containing recalcitrant organic substances. It was observed that the combined treatment by HC could significantly affect the performance of the applied AOPs, with as little as 3-9 passes through the cavitation generators. For O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dosages up to 2 and 4mgL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and UV dosage up to 300mJcm<sup>-2</sup>, HC enhanced DOC removal by 5-15% in all combinations, except for O<sub>3</sub>/UV AOPs. Overall, the potential benefits of HC for DOC removal were emphasized for low ratio between applied oxidants to DOC and high UV absorbance of the sample. Investigated DBPs formation potentials require special attention for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV AOPs and combinations with HC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
