Here in this work, a series of perovskite SrFe<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>3-\u03b4</sub> catalysts were prepared via a modified co-precipitation method and evaluated for catalytic ozone oxidative degradation of m-cresol. An artificial neural intelligence networks (ANN) model was employed to train the experimental data to optimize the preparation parameters of catalysts, with SrFe<sub>0.13</sub>Zr<sub>0.87</sub>O<sub>3-\u03b4</sub> being the optimal catalysts. The resultant catalysts before and after reduction were then thoroughly characterized and tested for m-cresol degradation. It was found that the co-doping of Fe and Zr at the B-site and the improvement of oxygen vacancies and oxygen active species by reduction dramatically increased TOC removal rates up to 5 times compared with ozone alone, with the conversion rate of m-cresol reaching 100%. We also proposed a possible mechanism for m-cresol degradation via investigating the intermediates using GC-MS, and confirmed the good versatility of the reduced SrFe<sub>0.13</sub>Zr<sub>0.87</sub>O<sub>3-\u03b4</sub> catalyst to remove other common organic pollutants in concentrated wastewater. This work demonstrates new prospects for the use of perovskite materials in wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
