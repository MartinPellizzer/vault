Our focus is on the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) in South Korea, which is the receptor region of this study. We examine the contributions of both local and transported emissions to an O<sub>3</sub> exceedance episode observed on June 3, 2019, estimating up to four days in advance. By using the CMAQ adjoint, we can determine the sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> remaining in the SMA to changes in O<sub>3</sub> precursor emissions (emissions-based sensitivity) and concentrations (concentrations-based sensitivity) along the long-range transport pathways and emission source regions overseas. These include Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Shandong, Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Central China. CMAQ adjoint-derived source attributions suggest that overseas precursor emissions and O<sub>3</sub> contributed significantly to the O<sub>3</sub> exceedance event in SMA. The emissions-based sensitivities revealed that precursor emissions originating from Shandong, YRD, Central China, and BTH contributed 11.42 ppb, 4.28 ppb, 1.24 ppb, 0.9 ppb, respectively, to the O<sub>3</sub> exceedance episode observed in the SMA. Meanwhile, Korean emissions contributed 31.1 ppb. Concentrations-based sensitivities indicated that 19.3 ppb of contributions originated in regions beyond eastern China and directly affected the O<sub>3</sub> level in the SMA in the form of background O<sub>3</sub>. In addition to capturing the transboundary movements of air parcels between the source and receptor regions, we performed HYSPLIT backward trajectory analyses. The results align with the trajectories of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors that we obtained from the adjoint method. This study represents a unique effort in employing the adjoint technique to examine the impacts of regional O<sub>3</sub> on South Korea, utilizing a combination of emissions-based and concentrations-based sensitivities.<i>Implications</i>: This research brings to light the critical role of both local and regional precursor emissions in contributing to an ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exceedance event in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), South Korea. Utilizing the CMAQ adjoint technique, a novel approach in the context of South Korea's O<sub>3</sub> investigations, we were able to delineate the quantitative contributions of different regions, both within South Korea and from overseas areas such as Beijing, Shandong, Shanghai, and Central China. Importantly, the results underscore the substantial influence of transboundary pollutant transport, emphasizing the need for international collaboration in addressing air quality issues. As metropolitan areas around the globe grapple with similar challenges, the methodology and insights from this study offer a potent tool and framework for regions seeking to understand and mitigate the impacts of O<sub>3</sub> on human health and the environment. By integrating different sensitivity types, coupled with HYSPLIT backward trajectory analyses, this research equips policymakers with comprehensive data to design targeted interventions, emphasizing the significance of collaborative efforts in tackling regional air pollution challenges. However, it's important to note the limitation of this study, which is a case study conducted over a short time period. This constraint may impact the generalizability of the findings and suggests a need for further research to validate and expand upon these results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Kashfi Yeganeh", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Momeni", "ForeName": "Mahmoudreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yunsoo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jincheol", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seoul"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38809877", "10.1080/10962247.2024.2361021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
