The socioeconomic status of each TPU was measured by a social deprivation index (SDI) derived from the proportions of the population with a) unemployment, b) monthly household income < US$250, c) no schooling at all, d) one-person household, e) never-married status, and f ) subtenancy, from the 2001 Population Census. TPUs were classified into three levels of SDI: low, middle, and high. We performed time-series analysis with Poisson regression to examine the association between changes in daily concentrations of ambient air pollution and daily number of deaths in each SDI group for the period from January 1996 to December 2002. We evaluated the differences in pollution effects between different SDI groups using a case-only approach with logistic regression.", "We found significant associations of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 mum, and ozone with all nonaccidental and cardiovascular mortality in areas of middle or high SDI (p < 0.05). Health outcomes, measured as all nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, in people residing in high SDI areas were more strongly associated with SO(2) and NO(2) compared with those in middle or low SDI areas.", "Neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation increases mortality risks associated with air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Chit-Ming", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Chun-Quan", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "King-Pan", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chau", "ForeName": "Yuen-Kwan", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thach", "ForeName": "Thuan-Quoc", "Initials": "TQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Roger Yat-Nork", "Initials": "RY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Graham Neil", "Initials": "GN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peiris", "ForeName": "Joseph Sriyal Malik", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Tze-Wai", "Initials": "TW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hedley", "ForeName": "Anthony Johnson", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "Tai-Hing", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Health Perspect. 2008 Sep;116(9):A370-1. doi: 10.1289/ehp.11856", "PMID": "18795176"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Class"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Armstrong BG.
