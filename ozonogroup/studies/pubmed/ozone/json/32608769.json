The characterization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their relationship with secondary formation were studied. The results show that in May 2019, there were four different ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution processes in Shanghai. The combined pollution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone that occurred under the meteorological conditions of average temperature of approximately 26\u2103 and relative humidity of approximately 40% was analyzed. The photochemical consumption of VOCs was significantly positively correlated with the maximum net growth of O<sub>3</sub> and there was a significant positive correlation between SOA<sub>P</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The key reactive species of VOCs that significantly contribute to ozone generation were <i>m</i>,<i>p</i>-xylene, ethylene, toluene, propylene, and <i>o</i>-xylene. The key reactive species that significantly contribute to secondary organic aerosols (SOA) were toluene, <i>m</i>,<i>p</i>-xylene, ethylbenzene, <i>o</i>-xylene, and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608769", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201907115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
