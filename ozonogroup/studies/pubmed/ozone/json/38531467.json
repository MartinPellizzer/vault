In this study, we collected individual-level information on AECOPD hospitalizations from a standardized electronic database in Guangzhou from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. We calculated the annual mean O\u2083 concentration prior to the dates of the index hospitalization for AECOPD using patients' residential addresses. Employing Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed the association between long-term O\u2083 concentration and the risk of AECOPD readmission across several time frames (30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days). We estimated the disease and economic burden of AECOPD readmissions attributable to O\u2083 using a counterfactual approach. Of the 4574 patients included in the study, 1398 (30.6%) were readmitted during the study period, with 262 (5.7%) readmitted within 30 days. The annual mean O\u2083 concentration was 90.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (standard deviation [SD]\u00a0=\u00a08.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). A 10-\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in long-term O\u2083 concentration resulted in a hazard ratio (HR) for AECOPD readmission within 30 days of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.49), with similar results for readmission within 90, 180, and 365 days. Older patients (aged 75 years or above) and males were more susceptible (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.10-1.61 and HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53, respectively). The population attributable fraction for 30-day readmission due to O\u2083 exposure was 29.0% (95% CI, 28.4%-30.0%), and the attributable mean cost per participant was 362.3 USD (354.5-370.2). Long-term exposure to elevated O\u2083 concentrations is associated with an increased risk of AECOPD readmission, contributing to a significant disease and economic burden."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
