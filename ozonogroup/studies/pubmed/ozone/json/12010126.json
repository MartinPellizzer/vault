They potentially play an important role in mitigating ozone depletion resulting from methyl chloride and methyl bromide emissions. The first step in the pathway(s) of methyl halide degradation involves a methyltransferase and, recently, the presence of this pathway has been studied in a number of bacteria. This paper reviews the biochemistry and genetics of methyl halide utilization in the aerobic bacteria Methylobacterium chloromethanicum CM4T, Hyphomicrobium chloromethanicum CM2T, Aminobacter strain IMB-1 and Aminobacter strain CC495. These bacteria are able to use methyl halides as a sole source of carbon and energy, are all members of the alpha-Proteobacteria and were isolated from a variety of polluted and pristine terrestrial environments. An understanding of the genetics of these bacteria identified a unique gene (cmuA) involved in the degradation of methyl halides, which codes for a protein (CmuA) with unique methyltransferase and corrinoid functions. This unique functional gene, cmuA, is being used to develop molecular ecology techniques to examine the diversity and distribution of methyl halide-utilizing bacteria in the environment and hopefully to understand their role in methyl halide degradation in different environments. These techniques will also enable the detection of potentially novel methyl halide-degrading bacteria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK. imcdonald@bio.warwick.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonald", "ForeName": "I R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Warner", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McAnulla", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodall", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oremland", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murrell", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100883692", "ISSNLinking": "1462-2912"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A6R43525YO", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CmuA protein, Methylobacterium chloromethanicum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyltransferases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hyphomicrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methylobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Methyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}], "NumberOfReferences": "64"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12010126", "10.1046/j.1462-2920.2002.00290.x", "290"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
