In this study a pulse corona discharge (PCD) reactor was employed to degrade gasoline in soil and simultaneously to fix nitrogen in soil. The gasoline removal rates were influenced by input power, electrode gap, gas flow rate, initial gasoline concentration, soil pH, and soil moisture. This technology produced no secondary pollution. Ozone, NOx, and hydroxyl radicals, generated directly on the soil surface, were identified as the primary agents responsible for gasoline degradation. The role of the major active agents was determined by ventilating different gases during the corona discharges. In addition, the concentration of nitrate and wettability of soil was increased after the treatment. Safety and fertility of treated soil were investigated by planting lettuce. Thus, soil pollution was remediated using this non-thermal plasma treatment, while simultaneously improving soil nitrogen content and physical characteristics. This process potentially enhances soil fertility and revegetation, since this environmentally-friendly method does not involve other chemicals injections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
