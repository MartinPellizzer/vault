Current treatments for OA are largely unsatisfactory. Ozone is an inexpensive, accessible, and easily applicable treatment for OA.", "The study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the effects of a short-term, three-month OA treatment using an intra-articular ozone injection, on pain and physical function in patients with stage 2-3 knee OA.", "The research team designed the study as a retrospective review of files from a hospital's archive as well as the results of a follow-up questionnaire about pain that patients completed at a related clinic.", "The study took place at the Algology Clinic at Ankara University in Ankara, Turkey.", "Participants were 94 patients, aged between 28 and 75 years, with stage 2-3 OA who had applied to the clinic between January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2020 and had received an intra-articular ozone injection.", "Participants received intra-articular ozone treatments at a dose of 10 ml at 15 mcg/ml for 4 weeks, once a week.", "Participants completed a visual analogue score (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), measuring pain at baseline and at one month and at 3 months postintervention. The study also determined if the treatment had an effect on analgesic drug use and measured patient satisfaction.", "The decreases in participants' pain scores on both scales were statistically significant at one month and at 3 months postintervention (P = .000). The need for analgesic medication had decreased for 56 participants (61.5%) at one month postintervention and for 50 (54.9%) at 3 months postintervention. Of the 94 participants, 66 (70.2%) were satisfied and 28 (29.8) weren't.", "The intra-articular injection of ozone, applied once a week for 4 weeks, resulted in a reduction in pain in stage 2-3 knee OA, without any side effects. However, further studies are needed to resolve the uncertainties in dosage, number of sessions, and intervals for intra-articular ozone injections. The current study's results need support from further prospective studies that can evaluate the efficacy of ozone treatment for a longer period of time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aliyev", "ForeName": "Dostali", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akkemik", "ForeName": "Umit", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Asik", "ForeName": "Ibrahim", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis, Knee"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intra-Articular"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36239567", "AT7585"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
