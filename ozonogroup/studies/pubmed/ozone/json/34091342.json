Ozonation is commonly utilized as pre-oxidation process to enhance the disinfection of hospital wastewater during COVID-19 spread. In this study, the transformation of ribavirin, antiviral for COVID-19, during ozone/PMS\u2011chlorine intensified disinfection process was investigated. \u2022OH followed by O<sub>3</sub> accounted for the dominant ribavirin degradation in most conditions due to higher reaction rate constant between ribavirin and \u2022OH vs. SO<sub>4</sub>\u2022<sup>-</sup> (1.9 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> vs. 7.9 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). During the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process, ribavirin was dehydrogenated at the hydroxyl groups first, then lost the amide or the methanol group. Chloride at low concentrations (e.g., 0.5- 2 mg/L) slightly accelerated ribavirin degradation, while bromide, iodide, bicarbonate, and dissolved organic matter all reduced the degradation efficiency. In the presence of bromide, O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process resulted in the formation of organic brominated oxidation by-products (OBPs), the concentration of which increased with increasing bromide dosage. However, the formation of halogenated OBPs was negligible when chloride or iodide existed. Compared to the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, the concentration of brominated OBPs was significantly higher after ozonation or the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process. This study suggests that the potential risks of the organic brominated OBPs should be taken into consideration when ozonation and ozone-based processes are used to enhance disinfection in the presence of bromide amid COVID-19 pandemic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
