PKM1 (tomato) plants against Cucumber mosaic virus infection by using the inactivated Cucumber mosaic virus inoculum. Application of a T(4) (0.4mg/l) concentration of ozone to the inoculum containing Cucumber mosaic virus resulted in complete inactivation of the virus. The inactivated viral inoculum was mixed with a penetrator (delivery agent), referred to as T(4) preparation, and it was evaluated for the development of systemic acquired resistance in the tomato plants. Application of a T(4) preparation 5 days before inoculation with the Cucumber mosaic virus protected tomato plants from the effects of Cucumber mosaic virus. Among the components of the inactivated virus tested, coat protein subunits and aggregates were responsible for the acquired resistance in tomato plants. In field trials, the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that, Cucumber mosaic virus accumulation was significantly less for all the test plants (16%) sprayed with the T(4) preparation than untreated control plants (89.5%) at 28 days postinoculation (dpi). A remarkable increase in the activities of the total soluble phenolics (10-fold) and salicylic acid (16-fold) was detected 5 days after the treatment in foliar extracts of test plants relative to untreated control plants. The results showed that treatment of tomato plants with inactivated viral inoculum led to a significant enhancement of protection against Cucumber mosaic virus attack in a manner that mimics a real pathogen and induces systemic acquired resistance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Advance Studies in Botany, University of Madras, Guindy Campus, Chennai-600 025, India. nadesansudhakar@yahoo.co.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sudhakar", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagendra-Prasad", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohan", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murugesan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Virol Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "8005839", "ISSNLinking": "0166-0934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O414PZ4LPZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cost-Benefit Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Virology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Inactivation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17689672", "10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.06.016", "S0166-0934(07)00245-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
