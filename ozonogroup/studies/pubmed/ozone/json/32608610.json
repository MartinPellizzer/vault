The results indicated that the main VOCs species were benzenes, alcohols, ketones, and esters, and the benzenes and alcohols contributed more in different types of processes and emission nodes, whereas the ketones and esters contributed less. The maximum concentration was 269.08mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (<i>n</i>-butanol). Strong correlation was found between the concentrations of the production line and their corresponding exhaust, but the VOC species were not totally identical. Furthermore, the potential formations of ozone and secondary organic aerosols were (3.09\u00b10.94) g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> and (2.58\u00b11.99) g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, expressed by O<sub>3</sub>/VOCs and SOA/VOCs, and the benzenes and internal coating drying being the major precursors and emission node."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Air Pollution Control Research Institute, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wen-Juan", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Qi", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Dang", "ForeName": "Hong-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Air Pollution Control Research Institute, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin-Min", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608610", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201904210"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
