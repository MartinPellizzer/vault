These halocarbons have effects on atmospheric chemistry since they cause ozone depletion. In this chapter, a survey is given of the different sources of these enzymes, some of their properties, the various methods to isolate them, and the bottlenecks in purification. The assays to detect and quantify haloperoxidase activity are described as well as their kinetic properties. Several practical tips and pitfalls are given which have not yet been published explicitly. Recent developments in research on structure and function of these enzymes are reviewed. Finally, the application of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases in the biosynthesis of brominated and other compounds is discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
