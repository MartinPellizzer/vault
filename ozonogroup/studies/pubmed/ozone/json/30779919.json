Canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channel is recently identified as a target of oxidative stress which is involved in airway inflammation. However, the regulatory role of TRPC6 in airway epithelial cells and neutrophils has not yet been illuminated in detail. In this study, we investigated the role of TRPC6 in neutrophil adhesion to airway epithelial cells exposed to O<sub>3</sub> in vivo and in vitro approaches. Using transgenic mice, the results showed that TRPC6-deficiency attenuated O<sub>3</sub>-induced neutrophil recruitment to airway epithelial cells and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. In vitro, O<sub>3</sub> induced ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil adhesion to 16HBE cells (human airway epithelial cell line) and which were reduced by both TRPC6 silencing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and TRPC6 inhibitor Larixyl Acetate (LA). We also confirmed that TRPC6-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and NF-\u03baB activation in 16HBE cells were required for ICAM-1-mediated neutrophil adhesion exposed to O<sub>3</sub>. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the contribution of TRPC6 to O<sub>3</sub>-induced neutrophil adhesion to airway epithelial cells via NF-\u03baB activation and ICAM-1 expression, which may provide new potential concepts for preventing and treating air pollutant-related inflammatory lung diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
