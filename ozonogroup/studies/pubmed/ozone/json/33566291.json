Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common disease of respiratory system among college students. In this study, we assess the acute effect of air pollution on clinic visits of college students for URTI in Wuhan, China. Data on clinic visits due to URTI were collected from Wuhan University Hospital, meteorological factors (including daily temperature and relative humidity) provided by Wuhan Meteorological Bureau, and air pollutants by Wuhan Environmental Protection Bureau. In the present\u00a0study, generalized additive model with a quasi-Poisson distribution link function was used to examine the association between ambient air pollutants (fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)) and the daily number of clinic visits of college students for URTI at Wuhan University Hospital in Wuhan, China. In the meantime, the model was adjusted for the confounding effects of long-term trends, seasonality, day of the week, public holidays, vacation, and meteorological factors. The best degrees of free in model were selected based on AIC (Akaike Information Criteria). The effect modification by gender was also examined. A total of 44,499 cases with principal diagnosis of URTI were included from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. In single-pollutant models, the largest increment of URTI visits were found at lag 0 day in single-day lags, and the effect values in cumulative lags were greater than those in single-day lags. PM<sub>2.5</sub> (0.74% (95%CI: 0.05, 1.44)) at lag 0 day, PM<sub>10</sub> (0.61% (95%CI: 0.12, 1.11)) and O<sub>3</sub> (1.01% (95%CI: 0.24, 1.79)) at lag 0-1 days, and SO<sub>2</sub> (9.18% (95%CI: 3.27, 15.42)) and NO<sub>2</sub> (3.40% (95% CI:1.64, 5.19)) at lag 0-3 days were observed to be strongly and significantly associated with clinic visits for URTI. PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were almost still significantly associated with URTI after controlling for the other pollutants in our two-pollutant models, where the effect value of SO<sub>2</sub> after inclusion of O<sub>3</sub> appeared to be the largest and the effects of NO<sub>2</sub> were also obvious compared with the other pollutants. Subgroups analysis demonstrated that males were more vulnerable to PM<sub>10</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, while females seemed more vulnerable to exposure to SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. This study implied that short-term exposure to ambient air pollution was associated with increased risk of URTI among college students at Wuhan University Hospital in Wuhan, China. And gaseous pollutants had more negative health impact than solid pollutants. SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were the major air pollutants affecting the daily number of clinic visits on URTI, to which females seemed more vulnerable than males."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Faxue", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Han", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Global Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chuangxin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Miaoxuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. dejiali1976@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dejia", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. weizhu@whu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ambulatory Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aboubakri O, Khanjani N, Jahani Y, Bakhtiari B (2019a) Attributable risk of mortality associated with heat and heat waves: a time-series study in Kerman, Iran during 2005-2017.
