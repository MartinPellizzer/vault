The committee was also asked to assess methods for estimating how much a reduction in short-term exposure to ozone would reduce premature deaths, to assess methods for estimating associated increases in life expectancy, and to assess methods for estimating the monetary value of the reduced risk of premature death and increased life expectancy in the context of health-benefits analysis. <i>Estimating Mortality Risk Reduction and Economic Benefits from Controlling Ozone Air Pollution</i> details the committee\u2019s findings and posits several recommendations to address these issues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2008 by the National Academy of Sciences.
