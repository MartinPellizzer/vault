As scientific research validates short- and long-term detrimental effects of UVR, physicians and the public must become increasingly aware of these problems to avoid them. Photoaging is defined. Choice of sunscreens, their Food and Drug Administration labeling, and future sunscreen products are reviewed. Hazards of UVR on the skin include acute sunburn, photocarcinogenesis, immunologic suppression, and photoaging. Distinguishing between UV-A and UV-B damage to the skin is discussed. Education of physicians and their patients is crucial to reduce future photodamage to our population, especially with a reduction of the ozone layer and with patients having more free time. The complete skin examination is emphasized as a method to detect photodamaged skin and give patients insight to provide themselves with future photoprotection. A summary of advice for patients is provided for physicians to give to their patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surger, University of Miami (Fla), USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaminester", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Fam Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9300357", "ISSNLinking": "1063-3987"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sunscreening Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Protection"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunscreening Agents"}], "NumberOfReferences": "135"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8620269", "10.1001/archfami.5.5.289"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
