Between March and May in 2018, 97 healthy adults were examined on 2 or 3 occasions for oral swab sampling. Hourly concentrations of ambient ozone 1-7 days preceding sampling were collected. Mixed-effect models were fitted to examine the associations between ambient ozone and the diversity and taxon abundances of oral microbiome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves estimated the accuracies of markers to delineate between samples exposed to different concentrations of ambient ozone. The associations between the makers and lung function were further examined by linear mixed effect models.", "The averages of daily mean concentrations of ambient ozone (O<sub>3-daily</sub>), maximum 8-h means (O<sub>3-8hmax</sub>) and 1-h maximums (O<sub>3-1hmax</sub>) were respectively 72\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3, 123\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3 and 144\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3. O<sub>3-daily</sub> was positively associated with \u03b1-diversity of oral microbiome, but the exposure-response curves only yielded positive associations in the range of O<sub>3-daily</sub> from 60\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3 to 75\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3. Results of O<sub>3-8hmax</sub> and O<sub>3-1hmax</sub> were consistent with these of O<sub>3-daily</sub>. With an interquartile range increase in O<sub>3-daily</sub> at lag04, the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased by 3.1% (95% CI: -4.0%, -2.2%) and Firmicutes increased by 3.3% (95% CI: 2.3%, 4.3%), whilst the Proteobacteria:Firmicutes ratio (P/F) decreased by 0.9 (95% CI: -1.5, -0.4). The areas under ROC curves for Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and P/F were 0.8535, 0.7569 and 0.8929, respectively. Proteobacteria and P/F were associated with forced expiratory volume in the first second and fractional exhaled nitric oxide significantly.", "Ambient ozone disturbs oral microbial homeostasis.
