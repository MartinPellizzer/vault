The amplification of radical cycling through OVOC photolysis provides an important positive feedback mechanism to accelerate ozone production. The large production of OVOCs near the surface helps promote photochemistry in the whole boundary layer. This amplifier effect is most significant in regions with high nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) and VOC concentrations such as Wangdu, China. Using a 1-D model with comprehensive observations at Wangdu and the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM), we find that OVOC photolysis is the largest free-radical source in the boundary layer (46%). The condensed chemistry mechanism we used severely underestimates the OVOC amplifier effect in the boundary layer, resulting in a lower ozone production rate sensitivity to NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions. Due to this underestimation, the model-simulated threshold NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission value, below which ozone production decreases with NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission decrease, is biased low by 24%. The underestimated OVOC amplifier effect in a condensed mechanism implies a low bias in the current 3-D model-estimated efficacy of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission reduction on controlling ozone in polluted urban and suburban regions of China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2924-2826"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric
