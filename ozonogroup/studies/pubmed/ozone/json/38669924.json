However, the measurement of intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) is lacking in studies focusing on gasoline evaporation. This study sampled organics from a real-world refueling procedure and analyzed the organic compounds using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC\u00d7GC-MS). The non-target analysis detected and quantified 279 organics containing 93 volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 64.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4\u00a0% in mass concentration), 182 IVOCs (34.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4\u00a0%), and 4 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs, 0.2\u00a0%). The refueling emission profile was distinct from that of gasoline exhaust. The b-alkanes in the B12 volatility bin are the most abundant IVOC species (1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) in refueling. A non-negligible contribution of 17.5\u00a0% to the ozone formation potential (OFP) from IVOCs was found. Although IVOCs are less in concentration, secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP) from IVOCs (58.1\u00a0%) even exceeds SOAP from VOCs (41.6\u00a0%), mainly from b-alkane in the IVOC range. At the molecular level, the proportion of cyclic compounds in SOAP (12.1\u00a0%) indeed goes above its mass concentration (3.1\u00a0%), mainly contributed by cyclohexanes and cycloheptanes. As a result, the concentrations and SOAP of cyclic compounds (>50\u00a0%) could be overestimated in previous studies. Our study found an unexpected contribution of IVOCs from refueling procedures to both ozone and SOA formation, providing new insights into secondary pollution control policy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
