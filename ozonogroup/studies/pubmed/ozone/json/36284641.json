However, low level pollution impacts on individual school absences are under-studied. Understanding the variability of pollution at individual schools within an urban region could improve school recess decisions, better identify local pollution sources, and improve local economic impact assessments by providing granular information relevant to specific schools. We modelled PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone concentrations at 36 schools from July 2015 to June 2018 using data from a dense, research grade regulatory sensor network. We determined exposures and daily absences at each school. We used a generalized estimating equations model to retrospectively estimate rate ratios for association between outdoor pollutant concentrations and school absences. We estimated lost school revenue, productivity, and family economic burden. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone concentrations and absence rates vary across the School District. Pollution exposure was associated with a rate ratio as high as 1.02 absences per <i>\u03bc</i>g m<sup>-3</sup> and 1.01 per ppb increase for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone, respectively. Significantly, even PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone exposure below the air quality index breakpoints for good air quality (<12.1 <i>\u03bc</i>g m<sup>-3</sup> and <55 ppb, respectively) was associated with positive rate ratios of absences: 1.04 per <i>\u03bc</i>g m<sup>-3</sup> and 1.01 per ppb increase, respectively. Granular local measurements enabled demonstration of air pollution impacts that varied between schools and were undetectable with averaged pollution levels. Reducing pollution by 50% would save $426000 per year districtwide. Pollution reduction benefits would be greatest in schools located in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Heterogeneity in exposure, disproportionately affecting socioeconomically disadvantaged schools, points to the need for fine resolution exposure estimation. The economic cost of absences associated with air pollution is substantial even excluding indirect costs such as hospital visits and medication. These findings may help elucidate the differential burden on individual schools and inform local decisions about recess and regulatory considerations for localized pollution sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7884-7362"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Respiratory, Critical Care and Occupational Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Utah, 26 North 1900 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Utah, 135 S 1460 E, RM 819, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Mendoza", "ForeName": "Daniel L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Respiratory, Critical Care and Occupational Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Utah, 26 North 1900 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Pirozzi", "ForeName": "Cheryl S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life, Earth, and Environmental Sciences, West Texas A&M University, Happy State Bank Academic & Research Building, Suite 262, Canyon, TX 79016, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Crosman", "ForeName": "Erik T", "Initials": "ET"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Respiratory, Critical Care and Occupational Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Utah, 26 North 1900 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Quantitative Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Liou", "ForeName": "Theodore G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Science and Mathematics Education, University of Utah, 155 S 1452 E, RM 452, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Cleeves", "ForeName": "Jessica J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Economics, University of Utah, 260 Central Campus Drive, RM 4100, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Bannister", "ForeName": "Stephen C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Utah, 257 S 1400 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Anderegg", "ForeName": "William R L", "Initials": "WRL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4511-4437"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Respiratory, Critical Care and Occupational Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Utah, 26 North 1900 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Robert", "ForeName": "Paine", "Initials": "P", "Suffix": "3rd"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 HL125520", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T32 HL105321", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101295599", "ISSNLinking": "1748-9326"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Liang F, Tian L, Guo Q, Westerdahl D, Liu Y, Jin X, Li G and Pan X 2017.
