O(3) sensitivity was assessed by recording the extent of visible symptoms, effects on chlorophyll (Chl) content and changes in Chl a fluorescence parameters. This paper reports the results of an initial screening of 14 bean cultivars that was used to select a small number of cultivars for further work. Seven cultivars showed visible symptoms of injury in the range of 2-60 h after the end of the O(3) fumigation. O(3) significantly depressed total Chl content in most cultivars and a significant correlation was found between Chl content and visible symptoms. Most cultivars showed a significant change in the F(v)/F(m) ratio, even when there were no visual symptoms. There was no relationship between the extent of visual symptoms and quenching coefficients, indicating that these parameters were of no use in the determination of sensitivity to O(3) stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica e Biotecnologie Agrarie, 56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guidi", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Cagno", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soldatini", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092981", "10.1016/s0269-7491(99)00170-0", "S0269-7491(99)00170-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
