To elucidate the molecular and cellular events underlying ozone toxicity in the lung, we hypothesized that lipid ozonation products (LOPs) generated by the reaction of ozone with unsaturated fatty acids in the epithelial lining fluid and cell membranes play a key role in mediating ozone-induced airway inflammation. To test our hypothesis, we ozonized 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and generated LOPs. Confluent human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to the derivatives of ozonized POPC-9-oxononanoyl, 9-hydroxy-9-hydroperoxynonanoyl, and 8-(5-octyl-1,2,4-trioxolan-3-yl-)octanoyl-at a concentration of 10 muM, and the activity of phospholipases A2 (PLA2), C (PLC), and D (PLD) was measured (1, 0.5, and 1 h, respectively). Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were utilized to predict the biological activity of LOPs in airway epithelial cells. The QSAR results showed a strong correlation between experimental and computed activity (r = 0.97, 0.98, 0.99, for PLA2, PLC, and PLD, respectively). The results indicate that QSAR models can be utilized to predict the biological activity of the various ozone-derived LOP species in the lung."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering, and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi 39217, USA. ramzi.m.kafoury@jsums.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kafoury", "ForeName": "Ramzi M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ming-Ju", "Initials": "MJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "G12RR12359", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "GM08047", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "100885357", "ISSNLinking": "1520-4081"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE895536Y5", "NameOfSubstance": "1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16007646", "10.1002/tox.20130"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
