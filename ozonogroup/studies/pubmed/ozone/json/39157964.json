Conventional wastewater treatment methods have shortcomings of incomplete degradation, long-time treatment and secondary pollution. For the first time, a rotational hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (RHCR) equipped with a conical rotor has been designed to enhance the ozonation process for effective degradation of pollutants. The effects of rotational speed, discharge voltage, gas flow rate, liquid flow rate and initial pH on methylene blue (MB) degradation were deeply investigated. The optimised conditions were initial pH\u2009=\u20099, rotational speed\u2009=\u20091800 rpm, discharge voltage\u2009=\u20099.3 kV, gas flow rate\u2009=\u200960 mL/min and liquid flow rate\u2009=\u200980 mL/min. With the integration of ozonation and cavitation in RHCR, the MB degradation efficiency reached 95.2%, which was 15.6% higher than that of the individual ozonation method. The degradation process was proven to track the first-order kinetic model, with the reaction rate and synergy index were 0.232\u2005min<sup>-1</sup> and 1.78, respectively. Through the quenching experiments, it can be confirmed that the contribution proportion of hydroxyl radical during degradation was increased by 8.7% due to the enhancement of cavitation. A required energy consumption of 74.7 kWh/order/m<sup>3</sup> and a total expense of 8.7 $/m<sup>3</sup> were calculated. The energy consumption of the RHCR was approximately 80% lower than that of the recently reported degradation system combining ozonation and cavitation, with total expense reduced by 52%. The findings of this work provide a new water treatment method and offered theoretical references for the design of RHCR."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Advanced Food Manufacturing Equipment & Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4775-1042"], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huiyang", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Advanced Food Manufacturing Equipment & Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0082-5427"], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jianfeng", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39157964", "10.1080/09593330.2024.2391075"]}}]}
