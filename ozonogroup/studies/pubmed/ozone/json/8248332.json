A simple formula was utilized to transform horizontal irradiances to vertical irradiances averaged over 360 degrees azimuth angle. The model was verified with spectral and broadband measurements. The difference between the theoretical and measured UV radiation falling to horizontal surfaces was in most cases less than +/- 10%, and the additional error to theoretical vertical irradiances was less than +/- 10%. The calculations show that the annual horizontal doses in Helsinki (60.2 degrees N, 25 degrees E) are about 35% higher than in Saariselk\u00e4 (68.4 degrees N, 27.5 degrees E), but the difference is only 16% for vertical doses owing to the stronger contribution to vertical (facial) surfaces of the reflection of UV from snow. At Saariselk\u00e4, the maximum vertical irradiance at the end of April approaches the midsummer values. The ozone depletions up to 40% in February and March 1992 had no significant effect on the annual doses because the total ozone returned to normal before the UV increased to biologically significant levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jokela", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leszczynski", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Visuri", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Finland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Snow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8248332", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.1993.tb04932.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
