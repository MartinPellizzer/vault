Here, we developed an integrated evaluation and optimization system for the O<sub>3</sub> control strategy by merging a response surface model for the O<sub>3</sub>-related mortality and an optimization module. Applying this system to the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), we evaluated driving factors for mortality changes from 2013 to 2017, quantified spatial and temporal O<sub>3</sub>-related mortality responses to precursor emission abatement, and optimized a health-oriented control strategy. Results indicate that insufficient NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission abatement combined with deficient VOCs control from 2013 to 2017 aggravated O<sub>3</sub>-related mortality, particularly during spring and autumn. Northern YRD should promote VOCs control due to higher VOC-limited characteristics, whereas fastening NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission abatement is more favorable in southern YRD. Moreover, promotion of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> mitigation in late spring and summer and facilitating VOCs control in spring and autumn could further reduce O<sub>3</sub>-related mortality by nearly 10% compared to the control strategy without seasonal differences. These findings highlight that a spatially and temporally differentiated NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs emission control strategy could gain more O<sub>3</sub>-related health benefits, offering valuable insights to regions with severe ozone pollution all over the world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of
