Children of smoking mothers have an increased risk of premature birth, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome and respiratory diseases during infancy. Smoking also causes long-term risk of maternal health problems such as: heart disease, cancer, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and higher mortality rate. Because women are more likely to quit smoking during pregnancy than at any other time, there are attempts to increase motivation and help them to stop smoking at the procreative phase of their life. The article describes interventions that are carried out in Loma Linda, where the educational program \"When You Smoke Your Baby Smokes\" reminds parents about the health effects of smoking during pregnancy and harmful impact on child's health caused by second-hand smoke. Another threat to health and environment of our children, is the nicotine coming from indirect exposure to tobacco smoke. Residual nicotine that persists in high concentrations on the interior surfaces, including clothing, is forming in the reaction of nitric acid carcinogenic compounds of specific nitrosamines. In addition, ozone and related atmospheric oxidants react with nicotine smoke or smoke coming from the second-hand smoke, giving the smallest particles with high risk of asthma. Efforts towards reducing exposure to tobacco smoke coming from the passive and indirect smoking should be placed at a high priority throughout the European Union."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Children's Hospital, Loma Linda, California 92354 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merritt", "ForeName": "T Allen", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mazela", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adamczak", "ForeName": "Aleksandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merritt", "ForeName": "Travis", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Editorial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Przegl Lek", "NlmUniqueID": "19840720R", "ISSNLinking": "0033-2240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6M3C89ZY6R", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Spontaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "European Union"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Promotion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant Welfare"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23421018"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
