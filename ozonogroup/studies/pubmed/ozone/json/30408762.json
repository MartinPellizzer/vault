However, due to the lack of long-term observation data, relevant research on the characteristics and influencing factors of urban ozone concentrations remains limited. Based on ground ozone observation data during 2006-2016, we quantified the causality influence of individual meteorological factors on ozone concentrations in Beijing using a convergent cross mapping (CCM) method. The result indicated that the influence of each meteorological factor on ozone concentrations varied significantly across seasons and years. At the inter-annual scale, all-year meteorological influences on ozone concentrations were much more stable than seasonal meteorological influences. At the seasonal scale, meteorological influences on ozone concentrations were stronger in spring and autumn. Amongst multiple individual factors, temperature was the key meteorological influencing factor for ozone concentrations in all seasons except winter, when wind, humidity and SSD exerted major influences on ozone concentrations. In addition to temperature, air pressure was another meteorological factor that exerted strong influences on ozone concentrations. At both the inter-annual and seasonal scale, the influence of temperature and humidity on ozone concentrations was generally stable whilst that of other factors experienced large variations. Different from PM<sub>2.5</sub>, meteorological influences on ozone concentrations were relatively weak in summer, when ozone concentrations were the highest in Beijing. Given the generally stable meteorological influences on ozone concentrations and human-induced emissions of VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> across seasons, warming induced notable increase in summertime biogenic emissions of VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> can be a major driver for the increasing ozone pollution episodes. This research provides useful references for understanding long-term meteorological influences on ozone concentrations in mega cities in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
