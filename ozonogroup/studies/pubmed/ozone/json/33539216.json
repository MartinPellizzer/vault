Consequently, alternatives for gossypol destruction must be evaluated. This work evaluated the emerging technology of ozone processing for free gossypol destruction in cottonseed meal. Ozonation was carried out in the actual cottonseed meal and also a model system, designed to describe the involved mode of action. The model system consisted of glass pearls beads covered with free gossypol. Ozonation was performed in two ways: as a static process, i.e., without homogenising the sample after placing them in the reactor, and also homogenising it. Ozone degraded free gossypol in all the systems, but reaching different levels. Free gossypol reduction was higher in the model system than the cottonseed meal, and higher in the homogenised processing than the static one: cottonseed meal in homogenised (56%) and static (25%); model system homogenised (98%) and static (80%). The obtained differences suggest a problem of gas penetration in the solid particles, the effect of unexposed surfaces due to contact areas, and the reaction with other organic molecules further than the target. Ozonation is a promising technique for gossypol degradation in cottonseed meal, but additional strategies are needed to optimise the ozonation process and evaluate toxicological aspects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4743-002X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), \"Luiz de Queiroz\" College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Romero", "ForeName": "Alessandra de C\u00e1ssia", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2764-4706"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), \"Luiz de Queiroz\" College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Calori-Domingues", "ForeName": "Maria Antonia", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5440-9974"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal Nutrition, Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Abdalla", "ForeName": "Adibe Luiz", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7435-343X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), \"Luiz de Queiroz\" College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Augusto", "ForeName": "Pedro Esteves Duarte", "Initials": "PED"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cottonseed Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KAV15B369O", "NameOfSubstance": "Gossypol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cottonseed Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gossypol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33539216", "10.1080/19440049.2020.1865579"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
