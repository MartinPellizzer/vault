Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of N<sub>2</sub>O by CO is considered an effective method for N<sub>2</sub>O elimination. However, O<sub>2</sub> exhibited a significant inhibition effect on the catalytic performance of N<sub>2</sub>O reduction by CO. A series of iron-based catalysts were prepared to investigate the effect of O<sub>2</sub> in SCR of N<sub>2</sub>O by CO. The Fe-Z-pH2 (Fe-ZSM-5 ion-exchanged under pH of 2) catalyst manifested superior activity at low temperature and excellent O<sub>2</sub> resistance in N<sub>2</sub>O reduction process. The characterization results from UV-vis DR spectra and XPS indicated that \u03b1-sites are the main active sites in Fe-Z-pH2, and they were inert to O<sub>2</sub> but highly active to N<sub>2</sub>O. It could be concluded that the competition effect between N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> was very important over different catalysts. O<sub>2</sub> is more prevalent over \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst, while N<sub>2</sub>O dominates over Fe-Z-pH2 catalyst. Moreover, in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, Fe-Z-pH2 exhibited better performance for N<sub>2</sub>O removal than non-noble mixed oxide catalysts, which might broaden the application of low-temperature SCR of N<sub>2</sub>O by CO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
