Subsequent in vitro analyses demonstrated detoxification of AFB1, suggesting a potential method of remediate AF-contaminated grain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of electrochemically produced ozone to degrade AFB1 in naturally contaminated whole kernel corn and confirm detoxification in turkey poults. Corn was procured from the southern coastal areas of Texas and HPLC revealed 1,220 +/- 73.3 ppb AFB1. Control and contaminated corn were treated for 92 h with O3 at 200 mg/min in 30 kg batches; greater than 95% reduction of AFB1 in contaminated corn was achieved. One-day-old female turkey poults were fed 1) control corn, 2) control corn + O3, 3) AFB1 corn, or 4) AFB1 corn + O3 mixed in rations (46% by wt.) and consumed ad libitum for 3 wk. When compared with controls, turkeys fed AFB1 corn had reduced body weight gain and relative liver weight, whereas turkeys fed control corn + O3 or AFB1 corn + O3 did not differ from controls. Furthermore, alterations in the majority of relative organ weight, liver discoloration, serum enzyme activity, hematological parameters, and blood chemistry caused by AFB1 were eliminated (no difference from controls) by treatment with O3. These data demonstrate that treatment of contaminated corn with electrochemically produced O3 provided protection against AFB1 in young turkey poults. It is important to note that treatment of control corn with O3 did not alter the performance of the turkey poults."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Public Health, Faculty of Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843-4458, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKenzie", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubena", "ForeName": "L F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Denvir", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rogers", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hitchens", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bailey", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harvey", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buckley", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxicosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkeys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9706072", "10.1093/ps/77.8.1094", "S0032-5791(19)40928-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
