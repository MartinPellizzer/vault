However, other complex systems have been successfully approximated using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this paper, ANNs are used to model and predict ambient O3 concentrations based on a limited number of measured hydrocarbon species, NOx compounds, temperature, and radiant energy. In order to examine the utility of these approaches, data from the Coastal Oxidant Assessment for Southeast Texas (COAST) program in Houston, TX, have been used. In this study, 53 hydrocarbon compounds, along with O3, nitrogen oxides, and meteorological data were continuously measured during summer 1993. Steady-state ANN models were developed to examine the ability of these models to predict current O3 concentrations from measured VOC and NOx concentrations. To predict the future concentrations of O3, dynamic models were also explored and were used for extraction of chemical information such as reactivity estimations for the VOC species. The steady-state model produced an approximation of O3 data and demonstrated the functional relationship between O3 and VOC-NOx concentrations. The dynamic models were able to the adequately predict the O3 concentration and behavior of VOC-NOx-O3 system a number of hourly intervals into the future. For 3 hr into the future, O3 concentration could be predicted with a root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 8.21 ppb. Extending the models further in time led to an RMSE of 11.46 ppb for 5-hr-ahead values. This prediction capability could be useful in determining when control actions are needed to maintain measured concentrations within acceptable value ranges."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hadjiiski", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hopke", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10842954", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
