This ozone is found to be depleted in heavy isotopes ((18)O and (17)O), with respect to the source water, following a strict mass-dependent rule. Our experiments also suggest that the isotopes are distributed at the apex and base positions of the bent ozone molecule in a random fashion, without obeying the zero-point energy constraint. Endowed with these characteristics, the electrolytic ozone provides a source of reference that has a known internal heavy isotope distribution for spectroscopic studies. In addition, this ozone, when subjected to photolytic decomposition, can be used as a source of atomic oxygen with mass-dependent isotope ratios that can be varied by simply changing the water composition. Such an oxygen source is important for studying isotope effects in gas-phase recombination/exchange reactions such as COO + O* --> [COOO*] --> COO* + O."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth Sciences Division, Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, Gujarat 380009, India. bhatta@prl.res.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savarino", "ForeName": "Joel", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luz", "ForeName": "Boaz", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19462962", "10.1021/ac900283q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
