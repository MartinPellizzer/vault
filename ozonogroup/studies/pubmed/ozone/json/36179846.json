Various advanced oxidation processes have been investigated for tetracyclines degradation and their transformation products (TPs) have recently gained more attention. Studies on ozonation are however seldom for the degradation of oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxycycline (DTC). In the present study, a lower O<sub>3</sub> inlet gas concentration (4.67 \u00b1 0.13 mg/L), supplied at a flow rate of 0.27 L/min, was shown to be more effective at removing OTC than the same dose of ozone applied at higher inlet gas concentration (up to 6.29 mg/L) over a shorter time at the same flow rate. The use of pCBA and t-BuOH indicated that ozone plays a more important role in the degradation of OTC than HO\u2022. The DTC degradation was less efficient than for OTC, with 99 % removal requiring twice the amount of ozone. OTC had almost no inhibition of Vibrio fischeri, however, the inhibition ratio was increased to 37 % (5-min) and 46 % (15-min) within 1 min of ozonation. Contrastly, DTC had toxic effects on V. fischeri (inhibition rate<sub>5min</sub> of 84 %) and sustained toxicity in samples treated for up to 40-min. The observed toxicities after treatment could be explained by the identified TPs (26 TPs for OTC and 23 for DTC, some identified for the first time) and their quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis data. Several TPs showed toxic or extremely toxic predicted effects on fish, daphnid, and green algae, corresponding with the V. fischeri inhibition results. Among the possible degradation pathways, aromatic ring hydroxylation and ring-opening pathways could lead to the formation of TPs less harmful to the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
