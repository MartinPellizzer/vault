A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30,315 children in the China Children, Homes, Health (CCHH) project, involving 205 preschools in six cities in China, to investigate the long-term effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents on lifetime-ever diagnosed pneumonia. Information on the lifetime-ever pneumonia and demographics were collected by validated questionnaires. The lifetime annual average ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, ozone and five main PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents, including SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, organic matter (OM) and black carbon (BC), were estimated according to preschool addresses by a combination of satellite remote sensing, chemical transport modeling and ground-based monitors. The prevalence of lifetime-ever diagnosed pneumonia was 34.5% across six cities and differed significantly among cities (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The two-level logistic regression models showed that the adjusted odds ratio for PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) and its constituents (per 1\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>)-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and OM were 1.12 (95% CI:1.07-1.18), 1.02 (1.00-1.04), 1.06 (1.04-1.09), 1.05 (1.03-1.07) and 1.09 (1.06-1.12), respectively. Children in urban area, aged\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0years and breastfeeding time\u00a0<\u00a06\u00a0months enhanced the risks of pneumonia. Our study provided robust results that long-term levels of ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its constituents increased the risk of childhood pneumonia, especially NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and OM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
