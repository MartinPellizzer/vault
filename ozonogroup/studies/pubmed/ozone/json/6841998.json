Selective UV filtration was accomplished by passing this radiation through Schott WG-320 cutoff filters of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mm thickness. Minimal erythema doses (MED) were determined for each filter combination. Starting with 0.5 and with 0.9 MED, groups of 20 mice were irradiated 5 days per week; this was increased by 20% increments (of the original dose) every 6th day for 40 days (\"0.5 MED\" and \"0.9 MED\" experimental groups, respectively). Other groups of mice were irradiated with the same incremental increases, starting at 6.5 J/cm2 (\"equal dose\" regimen). The salient results were: (1) shorter wavelength components appear to preferentially produce tumors; (2) resultant observable dose-response behavior for each regimen is a complicated function of concurrent \"light\" and \"dark\" reactions; (3) time-dose reciprocity is absent; and (4) there are no straightforward relationships among tumor efficiency, dose fractionation, and spectral distribution of excitation radiation. These results indicate that photocarcinogenesis is a dynamic process, in which events that result in tumor growth compete with those that cause tumor regression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Willis", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Menter", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-17555", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0426720", "ISSNLinking": "0022-202X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6841998", "10.1111/1523-1747.ep12555445", "S0022-202X(15)43980-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
