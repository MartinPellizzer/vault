The observed VOCs concentrations (VOCs-obs) were 47.1 ppbv and 59.2 ppbv for clear days (CD) and O<sub>3</sub>-polluted days (OPD), respectively. The increase in daytime concentrations of alkenes is a significant factor contributing to the enhanced atmospheric photochemical activity during the OPD period, corroborated by VOCs-loss, ozone formation potential (OFP), propy-equiv concentration, and L<sub>OH</sub>. The sensitivity analysis of O<sub>3</sub>-NOx-VOCs indicated that O<sub>3</sub> formation was in a transitional regime towards NOx-limited conditions. The results of positive matrix factorization (PMF) demonstrated that refining and petrochemicals (20.8-25.0\u00a0%), along with oil and gas evaporation (15.6-16.7\u00a0%) were the main sources of VOCs concentrations. Notably, source apportionment based on VOCs-obs underestimated the contributions from sources of reactive components. It is worth highlighting that the sunlight impact & background source was identified as the major contributor to L<sub>OH</sub> (21.6\u00a0%) and OFP (25.3\u00a0%), signifying its significant role in O<sub>3</sub> formation. This study reiterates the importance of controlling reactive VOC components to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution and provides a scientific foundation for air quality management, with emphasis on priority species and controlling sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
