Chamber- and flow-tube-generated SOA samples were collected, extracted in a methanol/water solution, and photolyzed for 1 h under identical irradiation conditions. In these experiments, the irradiation was equivalent to about 3-8 h of exposure to the sun in its zenith. The molecular level composition of the dissolved SOA was probed before and after photolysis with direct-infusion electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HR-MS). The mass spectra of unphotolyzed SOA generated by ozone oxidation of monoterpenes showed qualitatively similar features and contained largely overlapping subsets of identified compounds. The mass spectra of OH/NOx-generated SOA had more unique visual appearance and indicated a lower extent of product overlap. Furthermore, the fraction of nitrogen-containing species (organonitrates and nitroaromatics) was highly sensitive to the SOA precursor. These observations suggest that attribution of high-resolution mass spectra in field SOA samples to specific SOA precursors should be more straightforward under OH/NOx oxidation conditions compared to the ozone-driven oxidation. Comparison of the SOA constituents before and after photolysis showed the tendency to reduce the average number of atoms in the SOA compounds without a significant effect on the overall O/C and H/C ratios. SOA prepared by OH/NOx photooxidation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and guaiacol were more resilient to photolysis despite being the most light-absorbing. The composition of SOA prepared by ozonolysis of monoterpenes changed more significantly as a result of the photolysis. The results indicate that aqueous photolysis of dissolved SOA compounds in cloud/fog water can occur in various types of SOA, and on atmospherically relevant time scales. However, the extent of the photolysis-driven change in molecular composition depends on the specific type of SOA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Romonosky", "ForeName": "Dian E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25412112", "10.1021/jp509476r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
