All three channels are prominent at all wavelengths investigated. O2 vibrational distributions for each channel and each wavelength are also estimated assuming Boltzmann rotational distributions. Averaged over wavelength in the measured range, the yields of the O((3)P2) + O2(X (3)\u03a3g(-)), O((3)P2) + O2(a (1)\u0394g), and O((3)P2) + O2(b (1)\u03a3g(+)) channels are 0.36, 0.31,and 0.34, respectively. Photofragment distributions in the spin-allowed channel O((3)P) + O2(X (3)\u03a3g(-)) are compared with the results of quantum mechanical calculations on the vibronically coupled PESs of the singlet states B (optically bright) and R (repulsive). The experiments suggest that considerably more vibrational excitation and less rotational excitation occur than predicted by the quantum calculations. The rotational distributions, adjusted to fit the experimental images, suggest that the dissociation takes place from a more linear configuration than the Franck-Condon bending angle of 117\u00b0. The dissociation at most wavelengths results in a positive value of the anisotropy parameter, \u03b2, both in the experiment and in the calculations. Calculations indicate that both nonadiabatic transitions and intersystem crossings substantially reduce \u03b2 below the nominal value of 2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ulrich", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tokel", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Houston", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grebenshchikov", "ForeName": "S Yu", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23795961", "10.1021/jp4041088"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
