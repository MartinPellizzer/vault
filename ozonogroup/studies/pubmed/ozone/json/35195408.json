The construction of an electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) coordination structure to maximize the number of active sites and increase the intrinsic activity of active sites is an effective means to improve catalytic performance. In this work, the abundant Si-OH groups on PSBA-15 (SBA-15 before calcination) were used to anchor Mn to form a Si-O-Mn-based EMSI coordination structure. Detailed characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect significantly adjusts and stabilizes the electronic structure of Mn 3d states, resulting in an electron-rich center on the Si-O-Mn bond to promote the specific adsorption/activation of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and an electron-poor center on the (Si-O-)Mn-O bond to adsorb a large amount of CH<sub>3</sub>SH accompanied by its own oxidative degradation. <i>In situ</i> Raman and <i>in situ</i> Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses identify that catalytic ozonation over 3.0Mn-PSBA generates atomic oxygen species (AOS/*O) and reactive oxygen species (ROS/<sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) to achieve efficient decomposition of CH<sub>3</sub>SH into CO<sub>2</sub>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Furthermore, the electrons obtained from CH<sub>3</sub>SH in electron-poor centers are transferred to maintain the redox cycle of Mn<sup>2+/3+</sup> \u2192 Mn<sup>4+</sup> \u2192 Mn<sup>2+/3+</sup> through the internal bond bridge, thus accomplishing the efficient and stable degradation of CH<sub>3</sub>SH prolonged to 180 min. Therefore, the rational design of catalysts with abundant active sites and optimized inherent activity <i>via</i> the EMSI effect can provide significant potential to improve catalytic performance and eliminate odorous gases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Dingren", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Weiqi", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4333-8859"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yajing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6016-358X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Dehua", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Qiyu", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3875-5631"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35195408", "10.1021/acs.est.1c07065"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
