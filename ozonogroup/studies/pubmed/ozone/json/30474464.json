Subsequently, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) were also developed. In addition to refrigerant applications, they were used as foam blowing agents, as solvents and as propellants for many aerosols. In the 1970s and 1980s, concern developed about their environmental impact, specifically on stratospheric ozone depletion. Industry began to consider acceptable replacements. In 1987, many of the governments of the world came together and drafted the Montreal Protocol, calling upon Industry to initially phase out production of the CFCs and later HCFCs. Within 4\u2009months of the signing of the Montreal Protocol, the 15 global major producers joined together to form the Alternative Fluorocarbons Environmental Acceptability Study (AFEAS), which sponsored research into environmental effects and the Program for Alternative Fluorocarbons toxicity Testing, PAFT), which examined the toxicology of potential replacements for the CFCs and HCFCs. Nine replacements were identified by companies and, through this international cooperation; toxicology programs were designed, conducted, and evaluated without duplication of effort and testing; consequently these new products were introduced within less than 10\u2009years. Indeed the Montreal Protocol has been recognized as the most appropriate international treaty to phase-down HFCs. In 2016 the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol set out a phase-down schedule for the consumption and production of HFCs. In order to reduce the consumption and emissions of high GWP HFCs. Recently lower GWP HFCs and very low GWP HFOs (hydrofluoroolefins and HCFOs (hydrochlorofluoroolefins) have been introduced into a range of applications. Summaries of the toxicology profiles of some of the original CFCs and HCFCs, the replacements and the new post-PAFT replacements are described.
