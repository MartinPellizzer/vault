The measurement of exhaled NO was performed using NO analyser model 280i, Sievers Instruments, Inc., USA. This measurement was based on the gas phase chemiluminescence reaction between NO and ozone. The investigations were performed on the group of 85 asthmatic patients (34 with chronic mild asthma, 31 with chronic moderate asthma, 20 with chronic severe asthma). F(ENO) level in healthy, non-smoking volunteers (46 persons--control group) was mean 12.9 +/- 4.6 ppB and it was statistically significant lower than in all groups of asthmatics. The highest F(ENO) levels were observed in patients with severe asthma (74 +/- 72 ppB). Statistically significant lower levels of ENO were obtained in patients with moderate (42 +/- 31 ppB) and mild asthma (49 +/- 43 ppB). In all groups of asthmatic patients higher levels of F(ENO) were observed in subjects with allergic asthma. In patients with mild and moderate asthma ENO levels were negatively correlated with the used dosage of inhaled steroids. Similar dependences were not noticed in patients with severe asthma. The measurement of exhaled nitric oxide levels provides a rapid, reproducible, non-invasive and reliable test, which is very useful in diagnosis and treatment monitoring in asthmatic patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Klinika Alergologii i Chor\u00f3b Wewnetrznych, Samodzielnego Publicznego Szpitala, Akademii Medycznej w Bia\u0142ymstoku. z.zietkowski@wp.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zietkowski", "ForeName": "Ziemowit", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bodzenta-Lukaszyk", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tomasiak", "ForeName": "Maria Magdalena", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skiepko", "ForeName": "Roman", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Stezenie wydychanego tlenku azotu w nieinwazyjnej diagnostyce chorych na astme."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Pol Arch Med Wewn", "NlmUniqueID": "0401225"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Breath Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16130599"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
