The content of carbonaceous organic materials, nitrogenous compounds and phosphoric substances in sludge supernatant were measured. The release of soluble chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) caused by O3/H2O2 treatment were more than by O3 alone. As a result, it can be concluded that the efficiency of sludge breakup in O3/H2O2 was better than that in O3 alone. However, a peak appeared in both systems for the biodegradable substances such as carbohydrate. Carbohydrate could be used as the carbon source for denitrification, and the releasing of TN and TP may become an additional burden for a subsequent biological system. So, it was of benefit for the enhancement of cryptic growth and cost reduction by raising and maintaining the content of biodegradable substance and reducing the concentrations of the nitrogenous and phosphoric substances as far as possible. Therefore, sludge treated by O3/H2O2 with lower O3 dose would be more suitable than O3 alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Songliao Aquatic Environment, Ministry of Education, Jilin Jianzhu University, Changchun, 130118, Jilin Province, China E-mail: hitzyx@163.com; School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, Heilongjiang Province, China."}], "LastName": "Yuxin", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Songliao Aquatic Environment, Ministry of Education, Jilin Jianzhu University, Changchun, 130118, Jilin Province, China E-mail: hitzyx@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Wang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Information and Technology, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, 130118, Jilin Province, China."}], "LastName": "Helong", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Songliao Aquatic Environment, Ministry of Education, Jilin Jianzhu University, Changchun, 130118, Jilin Province, China E-mail: hitzyx@163.com."}], "LastName": "Baojun", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Songliao Aquatic Environment, Ministry of Education, Jilin Jianzhu University, Changchun, 130118, Jilin Province, China E-mail: hitzyx@163.com."}], "LastName": "Jinming", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25026588", "10.2166/wst.2014.185"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
