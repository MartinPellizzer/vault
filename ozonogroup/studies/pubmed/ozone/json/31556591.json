Inspired by the structure of skin, in this article, we design a new method to combine wrinkle structure with porous sponge structure and achieve a novel, flexible, compressible, and bifunctional sensor based on carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane (CNT-PDMS) with functions of humidity sensing and pressure sensing. The performance of the humidity sensing part can be controlled by the ultraviolet and ozone (UVO) treatment time and CNT concentration, while the sensitivity of the pressure sensing part can be controlled by the CNT concentration and grinding time of sugar granules. The bifunctional sensor can easily sense approaching and touching of a hand, which shows great potential of alarming and protecting some electronics. Moreover, the bifunctional sensor can also be used in detecting human joint motions and breath conditions as a wearable and flexible health monitor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2164-5476"], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Liming", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4185-2256"], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Haotian", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Xiaoliang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Haixia", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31556591", "10.1021/acsami.9b13383"]}}]}
