Leachates were collected from a municipal landfill site; samples containing around 1000 mg l(-1) COD and BOD(5)/COD ratio about 0.17 were treated by using two different processes or combinations between them, i.e. ozonation, coagulation-flocculation, ozonation followed by coagulation/flocculation and coagulation/flocculation followed by ozonation. The application of single ozonation resulted to the efficient removal of color and organic loading, due to the respective oxidation, induced by ozonation; however, COD values lower than 200 mg l(-1) could be only achieved after prolonged reaction times and for high ozone production rates. The coagulation of leachate samples was studied by the addition of ferric chloride or poly-aluminum chloride agents at various dosages. Maximum COD removal rates (up to 72%) were achieved by the addition of 7 mM Fe, or of 11 mM Al respectively. However, final COD values higher than 200 mg l(-1) were obtained indicating the requirement of an additional treatment step. Pre-ozonation followed by coagulation/flocculation was not found to be an efficient treatment approach for this aim, but coagulation/flocculation followed by ozonation, was proved to be an efficient process for the reduction of COD to lower than 180 mg l(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemical Technology, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki GR-541 24, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ntampou", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zouboulis", "ForeName": "A I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samaras", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15967479", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.04.067", "S0045-6535(05)00644-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
