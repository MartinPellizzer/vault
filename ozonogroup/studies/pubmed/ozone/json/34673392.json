Adoption of Fe-Mn/PAC pellet in microbubble ozonation enhanced the 1-h chemical oxygen demand (COD) and phenol removal in PWW to 79% and 95%, respectively. With ozone dosage of 10\u00a0mg/L, 1\u00a0g/L Fe-Mn/PAC pellet exhibited ozone conversion of 92%. In comparison to microbubble ozonation process, Fe-Mn/PAC induced microbubble-catalytic ozonation process promoted ozone decomposition rate by 1.9 times. In terms of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH production, Fe-Mn/PAC pellet enhanced <sup>\u2022</sup>OH exposure by 10 times, with a R<sub>ct</sub> value of 2.92\u00a0\u00d7\u200910 <sup>-8</sup>. R<sub>ct</sub> kinetic model also suggested that Fe-Mn/PAC pellet obtained higher kinetic rate constants for initiating and promoting <sup>\u2022</sup>OH generation. Usage of Fe-Mn/PAC pellet in microbubble ozonation for phenolic wastewater treatment also reduced the total ozone consumption by 70%. In Fe-Mn/PAC induced microbubble-catalytic ozonation process, the ratio between ozone consumption and COD removal (\u0394O<sub>3</sub>/\u0394COD) was 0.91. Fe-Mn/PAC pellet characterization with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed successful doping of Fe-Mn on PAC substrate and larger numbers of carbon-oxygen/hydroxyl surface groups, which played key roles in ozone decomposition and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
