This is particularly important for the treatment of industrial effluents, released from pharmaceutical industries, which can contain rather high concentrations of antimicrobials. The aim of this work was to evaluate membrane bioreactors (MBRs), nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and ozonation, as well as their combinations, for the removal of antimicrobials from a synthetic wastewater which simulated highly contaminated industrial effluents. The study was performed using a mixture of four important classes of antimicrobials, including sulfonamides (SA), fluoroquinolones (FQ), macrolides (MAC) and trimethoprim (TMP). Performance of two different types of MBRs, Kubota and Zenon, was evaluated under different regimes regarding hydraulic retention time, total organic load and total nitrogen load. It was shown that elimination of SA in MBR treatment was very efficient, while the elimination of MAC, FQ, and TMP was incomplete. A mass balance of these contaminants in MBR suggested that microbial transformation represented the main mechanism, while only a small percentage was eliminated from the aqueous phase by adsorption onto sludge particles. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis achieved high elimination rates however produced highly contaminated concentrate. High removal was achieved using ozonation, but further research is needed to characterize formed ozonation products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
