Oxygen radicals are produced by inflammatory cells in the airways and/or inhaled directly from environmental air. There is ample evidence that oxygen radical production is increased in asthma and is closely related to the pathogenesis and that exogenous oxidants such as cigarette smoke and ozone directly cause asthma exacerbation. The mechanism by which oxygen radicals cause asthma pathology is oxidation or nitration of proteins, lipids, or DNA to cause dysfunction of these molecules. In addition, physiological antioxidant system, which is equipped to protect host from detrimental oxidants, is impaired in asthma, possibly because of inflammation. Thus, the imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant that is called oxidant stress is critical in asthma pathogenesis. Elegant technique to measure oxygen radicals and the footprints of oxidant stress in patients with asthma have been developed and give an important clue to evaluate possible involvement of oxygen radicals in individual pathophysiology. Therapeutic interventions that reduce oxidant stress and enhance antioxidant defense may be useful in the treatment of asthma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Clinical Research, Mie National Hospital, 357 Osato-kubota, Tsu, Mie 514-0125, Japan. fujisawa@mie-m.hosp.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujisawa", "ForeName": "Takao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets Inflamm Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "101160019", "ISSNLinking": "1568-010X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "NumberOfReferences": "76"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16101530", "10.2174/1568010054526304"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
