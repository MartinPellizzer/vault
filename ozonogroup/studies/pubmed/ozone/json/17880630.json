The outcome was not inconsistent, however, with some observations of recognition, beyond mere detection, at about 15-20 ppb. Individual differences in sensitivity lay at or just below an order of magnitude, rare in olfactory testing and indicative of precision. In a study of d-limonene, subjects again showed high sensitivity and small individual differences. The subjects could detect the odor at 8 and 15 ppb, depending upon whether they occupied a space with or without carbon filtration, respectively. The results argue for use of carbon filtration to measure sensitivity most stringently, although absence of filtration seems not to incur a large penalty. The protocol used here, with collection of hundreds of judgments in a day, yet with little net exposure of the subject to odorant; with verifiably stable delivery; and with analytical confirmation of level should reduce tolerance for outcomes of large differences among subjects and among studies.", "Humans manifested much higher sensitivity to ozone and D-limonene than commonly thought, a pattern revealing itself more broadly in olfactory studies as testing improves and analytical confirmation of delivery becomes more common. Published databases, with errors of +/-1000%, often badly underestimate sensitivity and can thereby encourage use of higher concentrations of compounds, particularly VOCs, than relevant in studies of reactive indoor chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemosensory Perception Laboratory, Department of Surgery (Otolaryngology), University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0957, USA. wcain@ucsd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cain", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolkoff", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Indoor Air", "NlmUniqueID": "9423515", "ISSNLinking": "0905-6947"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17880630", "10.1111/j.1600-0668.2007.00476.x", "INA476"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
