The annual concentration of O<sub>3</sub> in Beijing was about 56.18 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in 2014. In the over polluted days during May and September, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration could reach as high as 148.05 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The diurnal distribution of ozone presented a clear unimodal pattern with its peak appearing at 15:00 or 16:00 and trough at 06:00 or 07:00 and the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> during 09:00 and 23:00 was significantly higher than those in the Summer time. For the spatial distribution of O<sub>3</sub>, the concentration was lower in central urban area with the highest concentration appearing at plant garden site in the west of the urban area. Ground weather type of O<sub>3</sub> over polluted days was divided into three categories including high-pressure, low-pressure, equalizing field, which accounted for 16%, 36%, 48%, respectively. The concentration of O<sub>3</sub> was negatively correlated with the air pressure, humidity and visibility while it was positively correlated with the wind speed and temperature. In one heavy pollution episode of O<sub>3</sub> caused by local photochemical pollution and regional transport from May 29th to June 1st in 2014 in Beijing, regional transport showed a very important influence on the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> in Beijing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Nian-Liang", "Initials": "NL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Da-Wei", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Huan", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spatial Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964868", "10.13227/j.hjkx.2016.06.006"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
