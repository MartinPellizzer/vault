However, the underlying mechanisms for the success are unknown and the therapy has not been accepted fully within conventional medicine. This study sought to assess the effect of ozone therapy on resting muscle oxygenation.", "Twenty-three (23) patients and 3 volunteers were recruited for this prospective study. Systemic ozone therapy was administered by autohemotransfusion on three alternate days over 1 week. Tissue oxygenation (mmHg) was directly measured in the tibialis anterior muscle using polarographic needle electrodes before and after the first and the third ozone therapy session.", "Globally, the differences in oxygenation were not statistically significant but there was a significant decrease in the percentage of low-oxygenated values (pO(2) < 5 mmHg) following ozone sessions (p < 0.02). The change in muscle oxygenation following ozone therapy was inversely correlated with age (r = -0.398; p = 0.044) and with the initial (baseline pretherapy) muscle oxygenation values (r = -0.644; p < 0.001), indicating that the more poorly oxygenated muscles benefited most from the therapy. A significant (p = 0.031) higher oxygenation in these tissues was observed 48 hours after the second session.", "Ozone therapy can modify oxygenation in resting muscles, particularly of those that are most hypoxic. Our results suggest that ozone therapy could be used effectively as a complementary treatment of hypoxic and ischemic syndromes and that the therapy warrants further investigation for possible application in other clinical conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation Oncology Department, Research Unit, Dr. Negr\u00edn University Hospital, Canary Islands, Spain. bernardinoclavo@terra.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clavo", "ForeName": "Bernardino", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "Juan L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su\u00e1rez", "ForeName": "Gerardo", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lloret", "ForeName": "Marta", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Victor", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mac\u00edas", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santana", "ForeName": "Maite", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morera", "ForeName": "Jes\u00fas", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fiuza", "ForeName": "Dolores", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robaina", "ForeName": "Francisco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcnderoth", "ForeName": "Martina", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confidence Intervals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12804078", "10.1089/10755530360623365"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
