Human data demonstrated that exposure to various ambient air contaminants including ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) adversely affected nervous system functions. It is also well-established that substance abuse produces central nervous system dysfunctions with resultant increase in suicide rates. However, the role of substance abuse in combination with O<sub>3</sub> exposure on mental health remained to be determined. The aim of this investigation was to conduct a time-stratified case-crossover study to examine the possible correlation between short-term ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposure and daily hospital admissions for substance abuse, including alcohol dependence syndrome and non-dependent abuse of drugs, in Taipei from 2009 to 2013. In our single pollutant model, a 35% rise in interquartile (IQR) O<sub>3</sub> levels on cool days and a 12% elevation on warm days was associated with increase in mental health hospitalizations. In our two-pollutant models, O<sub>3</sub> remained significantly associated with elevated number of hospitalizations after adding any one of possible air pollutants, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO, to our model on cool and warm days. Data suggested that temperature may affect the association between outdoor ambient air O<sub>3</sub> exposure and enhanced risk of hospitalization for substance abuse. Further study is needed to better understand these findings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Healthcare Administration, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Shang-Shyue", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of pediatrics, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang-Gung University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chih-Cheng", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Pei-Shih", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Health Research Institute, Miaoli, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "27"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35392774", "10.1080/15287394.2022.2053021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
