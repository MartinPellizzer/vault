Total duration of the study was 45 days consisting of two clinical phases (phase I, i.e., aided) and phase II, i.e. unaided) of the duration of 21 days in each phase, with a washout period of 3 days between the two phases. With a split-mouth design, sites from each subject were randomly allocated into two treatment groups: Powered Toothbrushing (PB) and OZI were randomly done for each half side of the mouth of each subject. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from sites of both the treatment groups and sent for microbial analysis. Clinical and microbial parameters were measured before and after the treatment.", "Significant improvement of the clinical and microbial parameters was found in both treatment groups.
