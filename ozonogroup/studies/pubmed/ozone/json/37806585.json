Studies are needed to improve the technology used for the simultaneous removal of harmful cyanobacteria and algal metabolites. In this review, widely reported advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) strategies for removing major species Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and microcystins (MCs) were screened through bibliometrics, such as photocatalysis, activated persulfate, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Ozone oxidation, ultrasonic oxidation, and electrochemical oxidation, etc. AOPs generate kinds of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inactivate cyanobacteria and degrade cyanotoxins. A series of responses occurs in algal cells to resist the damaging effects of ROS generated by AOPs. Specifically, we reviewed laboratory research, mechanisms, practical applications, and challenges of HABs treatments in AOPs. Problems common to these technologies include the impact of algal response and metabolites, and environmental factors. This information provides guidance for future research on the removal of harmful cyanobacteria and treatment of algal metabolites using AOPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
