We wished to assess the effects of pollutants on asthmatic children in Chongqing, China. Daily numbers of hospital visits because of asthma attacks in children aged 0-18 years in 2013 were collected from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Data on pollutants were accessed from the nine air quality-monitoring stations in Chongqing. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied and conditional logistic regression was undertaken to analyze the data. We found that short-term exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, sodium dioxide, nitrogen and carbon monoxide could trigger hospital visits for asthma in children. Nitrogen dioxide had an important role, whereas ozone had no effect."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
