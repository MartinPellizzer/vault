The measured liquid-phase bimolecular rate coefficients of the AH2 + O3 reaction exhibit a significant pH dependence, and the corresponding values at ionic strength 0.2 M are (3.1 \u00b1 2.0) \u00d7 105 M-1 s-1 and (1.2 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 107 M-1 s-1 for pH \u2248 2 and 6, respectively. These results measured in micron-sized droplets are in agreement with those from previous bulk measurements, indicating that the observed aerosol reaction kinetics can be solely explained by liquid phase diffusion and AH2 + O3 reaction. Furthermore, the results indicate that high ionic strengths could enhance the liquid-phase rate coefficients of the AH2 + O3 reaction. The results also exhibit a negative ozone pressure dependence that can be rationalized in terms of a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type mechanism for the heterogeneous oxidation of AH2 aerosol particles by gas-phase ozone. The results of the present work imply that in acidified airway-lining fluids the antioxidant ability of AH2 against atmospheric ozone will be significantly suppressed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan. ypchang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Pin", "Initials": "YP", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shan-Jung", "Initials": "SJ", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Min-Sian", "Initials": "MS", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Che-Yu", "Initials": "CY", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Genin Gary", "Initials": "GG", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "36"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33876156", "10.1039/d0cp06493a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
