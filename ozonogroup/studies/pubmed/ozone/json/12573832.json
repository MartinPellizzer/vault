Column elution experiments and analyses were conducted. Compounds with an easy capacity for dissociation to ions, such as KCN and potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), were found to be eluted by forming free cyanide even in fresh water. Hexacyanoferrate(II) salts, such as potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) and iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II), were found not to be dissociated in water, but were dissociated and diffused under alkaline conditions (pH >13). Hexacyanoferrate(II) ion was found to be more easily dissociated in water with a higher pH. Column tests as above were also conducted for soil samples taken from a former paint ink factory using iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II), cyanogen chloride, potassium cyanate, copper cyanide, as well as potassium cyanide, as raw materials. It was demonstrate that iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) was dissociated and eluted under alkaline conditions. The elution rate was reduced when the contaminated soil was sandwiched with standard soil layers.Further, it was found that the Fe(CN)(6)(4-) ion eluted with NaOH from hexacyanoferrate acid in soil, were easily decomposed into cyanic acid or other byproducts by UV with the addition of ozone and H(2)O(2)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Naito Kankyou-Kanri Co., 2051-2 Saitama-shi, 336-0015, Saitama, Japan. mitsuo_matsumura@knights.co.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumura", "ForeName": "Mitsuo", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kojima", "ForeName": "Toshinori", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferrocyanides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Poisons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ferrocyn"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MQD255M2ZO", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Cyanide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferrocyanides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poisons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Cyanide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12573832", "10.1016/s0304-3894(02)00248-0", "S0304389402002480"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
