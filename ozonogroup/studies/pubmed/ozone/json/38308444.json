The effects of different ozone treatment concentration, ozone treatment duration and ozone treatment times on the growth, disease and fruit setting rate of potted tomato were analyzed.", "Different ozone treatment had effects on leaf mildew, gray mold and fruit setting rate of tomato. The influence degree of three factors on leaf mildew, gray mold and fruit setting rate was from large to small, a\u2009>\u2009b\u2009>\u2009c, a\u2009>\u2009c\u2009>\u2009b, b\u2009>\u2009a\u2009>\u2009c. A quadratic regression model was established with the control effect of tomato leaf mildew, gray mold and fruit setting rate as response values, and the optimal parameter combination was determined: The ozone treatment concentration was 0.0465\u2009g\u2009kg<sup>-1</sup>, the ozone treatment time was 30\u2009min, and the ozone treatment times were twice a week. In this case, the control efficiency of tomato leaf mildew was 95.02%, the control effect of gray mold was 99.49%, and the fruit setting rate was 76.5%.
