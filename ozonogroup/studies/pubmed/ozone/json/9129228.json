We hypothesized that the stratum corneum (SC), as the outermost skin layer and the permeability barrier of the skin, represents a sensitive target for O(3)-induced oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis, SKH-1 hairless mice were anesthetized and exposed for 2 h to O(3) by using two strategies: (i) single exposures to 0 (n = 12), 1 (n = 4), 5 (n = 4), and 10 (n = 4) ppm; and (ii) repeated daily exposures to 0 ppm (controls; n = 4) and 1 ppm (n = 4) for six consecutive days. New techniques based on the removal of SC by tape stripping were used to analyze the biologic effects of O(3) with respect to vitamin E depletion and lipid peroxidation. SC tissue was extracted from the tape and immediately analyzed by HPLC for vitamin E and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. After in vivo exposure to increasing O(3) doses, vitamin E was depleted and MDA formation was increased, both in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, repeated low-level O(3) exposures resulted in cumulative oxidative effects in the SC: As compared with O(3) exposures of 0 ppm (alpha-tocopherol, 8.95 +/- 1.3 pmol per mg; gamma-tocopherol, 3.00 +/- 0.3 pmol per mg; MDA, 3.69 +/- 0.3 pmol per mg), vitamin E was depleted (alpha-tocopherol, 2.90 +/- 0.6 pmol per mg, p < 0.001; gamma-tocopherol, 0.5 +/- 0.1 pmol per mg, p < 0.001) and MDA levels were increased (4.5 +/- 0.2; p < 0.01). This report demonstrates the unique susceptibility of the SC to oxidative damage upon exposure to O(3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3200, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thiele", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Traber", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Polefka", "ForeName": "T G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cross", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Packer", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0426720", "ISSNLinking": "0022-202X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Hairless"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9129228", "10.1111/1523-1747.ep12292144", "S0022-202X(15)42892-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
