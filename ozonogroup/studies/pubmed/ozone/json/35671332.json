The reactivity dropped by a factor of about four for amino acid residues with secondary amide bonds and by a factor of up to nearly 20 for amino acid residues with tertiary amide bonds, compared with that in acetonitrile. According to density functional theory studies, the lower reactivity is due to protonation of the amide moiety, whereas in neutral water, hydrogen bonding with the amide should have little impact on the absolute reaction rate compared with that in acetonitrile. This finding can be rationalized by the high reactivity and broad reaction pattern of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u00b7</sup>. Although hydrogen bonding involving the amide group raises the energies associated with some electron transfer processes, alternative low-energy pathways remain available so that the overall reaction rate is barely affected. The undiminished high reactivity of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u00b7</sup> toward aliphatic amino acid residues in a neutral aqueous environment highlights the health-damaging potential of exposure to the combined air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u00b7</sup>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5373-2833"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Bio21 Institute, The University of Melbourne, 30 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Nathanael", "ForeName": "Joses Grady", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Bio21 Institute, The University of Melbourne, 30 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1756-5449"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Bio21 Institute, The University of Melbourne, 30 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Wille", "ForeName": "Uta", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetonitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetonitriles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35671332", "10.1021/acs.est.2c00863"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
