The evolution of pH-dependent differential absorbance spectra suggests that O<sub>3</sub> preferentially reacts with the DOM phenolic moieties and less so with the aromatic carboxylic groups with increasing O<sub>3</sub>/DOC (dissolved organic carbon) ratios and changes of UV absorbance and fluorescence. When ozonation used as pretreatment, the formation of halophenols in subsequent chlorination decreased linearly with increasing O<sub>3</sub> doses or changes of UV absorbance until it reached 85% suppression of the halophenols' formation from unaltered DOM. The thresholds of decreases of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence corresponding to 85% suppression of halophenols' formation were in the range of 25%-30%, 30%-35% and 30%-45%, respectively. Pre-ozonation also showed a moderate suppression of haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation potentials, \u226426.5% for reverse osmosis isolate of Suwannee River natural organic matter and \u226431.5% for Yangtze River at applied O<sub>3</sub> doses. Measurement of changes of estrogenic activity during ozonation of water and wastewater showed that to attain a >90% abatement of estrogenic activity, the corresponding thresholds of decreases of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence were \u223c30%, \u223c40%, and \u223c70%, respectively. Bromate formation was also suppressed to below 10\u202f\u03bcg/L before these thresholds. This study suggests that optimal ozonation conditions and a balance between control of disinfection byproducts (halophenols, HAAs and bromate) and elimination of estrogenic activity can be reached based on online data."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
