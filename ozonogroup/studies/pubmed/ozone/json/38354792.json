We investigated these possible effects using a plant-pollinator interaction where the VOCs responsible for pollinator attraction are known and which is commonly exposed to high O<sub>3</sub> concentration episodes: the Mediterranean fig tree (Ficus carica) and its unique pollinator, the fig wasp (Blastophaga psenes). In controlled conditions, we exposed fig trees bearing receptive figs to a high-O<sub>3</sub> episode (5\u00a0h) of 200\u00a0ppb and analyzed VOC emission. In addition, we investigated the chemical reactions occurring in the atmosphere between O<sub>3</sub> and pollinator-attractive VOCs using real-time monitoring. Finally, we tested the response of fig wasps to the chemical signal when exposed to increasing O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratios (0, 40, 80, 120 and 200\u00a0ppb). The exposure of the fig tree to high O<sub>3</sub> levels induced a significant decrease in leaf stomatal conductance, a limited change in the emission by receptive figs of VOCs not involved in pollinator attraction, but a major change in the relative abundances of the compounds among pollinator-attractive VOCs in O<sub>3</sub>-enriched atmosphere. Fig VOCs reacted with O<sub>3</sub> in the atmosphere even at the lowest level tested (40\u00a0ppb) and the resulting changes in VOC composition significantly disrupted the attraction of the specific pollinator. These results strongly suggest that current O<sub>3</sub> episodes are probably already affecting the interaction between the fig tree and its specific pollinator."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
