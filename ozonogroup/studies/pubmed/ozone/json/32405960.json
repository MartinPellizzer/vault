For most practical problems, however, a computationally efficient solution method is not known to exist. While this problem has attracted a significant amount of attention, the majority of specifically designed algorithms do not scale well with respect to the problem size or do not provide a usable open-source package. In this study, we show that any global continuous optimization technique can be used for solving the representative subset selection problem. The latter is achieved by designing a simple transformation which embeds the problem's discrete space into a larger continuous space. The proposed methodology is applied to design problems in environmental and statistical domains. We evaluate the proposed method using several open-source global optimization packages, and show that this technique compares favorably with existing direct methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9875-0616"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mathematics and Physics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4072, Australia. r.vaisman@uq.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Vaisman", "ForeName": "Radislav", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CE140100049", "Agency": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Mathematical Statistical Frontiers", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Science"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32405960", "10.1007/s10661-019-7938-6", "10.1007/s10661-019-7938-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
