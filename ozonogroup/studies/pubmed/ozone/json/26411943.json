In this study, to assess indoor air quality in Chiba City, gaseous chemical compounds were surveyed using four types of diffusive sampler.", "Gaseous chemical compounds such as carbonyls, volatile organic compounds (VOC), acid gases, basic gases, and ozone were measured in indoor and outdoor air of 50 houses throughout Chiba City in winter and summer. Four types of diffusive sampler were used in this study: DSD-BPE/DNPH packed with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine and trans-1,2-bis(2-pyridyl)ethylene-coated silica for ozone and carbonyls; VOC-SD packed with Carboxen 564 particles for volatile organic compounds; DSD-TEA packed with triethanolamine-impregnated silica for acid gases; and DSD-NH3 packed with phosphoric acid-impregnated silica for basic gases.", "Almost all compounds in indoor air were detected at higher concentrations in summer than in winter. However, the nitrogen dioxide concentration in indoor air particularly increased only in winter, which well correlated with the formic acid concentration (correlation coefficient=0.974). The compound with the highest concentrations in indoor air was p-dichlorobenzene, with recorded levels of 13,000\u2005\u03bcg\u2005m(-3) in summer and 1,100\u2005\u03bcg\u2005m(-3) in winter in indoor air.", "p-Dichlorobenzene in summer and nitrogen dioxide in winter are detected at markedly high concentrations. Pollution control and continuous monitoring of IAQ are indispensable for human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Public Health."}], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Hironari", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uchiyama", "ForeName": "Shigehisa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kihara", "ForeName": "Akiko", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsutake", "ForeName": "Toyoshige", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bekki", "ForeName": "Kanae", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Inaba", "ForeName": "Yohei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakagome", "ForeName": "Hideki", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kunugita", "ForeName": "Naoki", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Eiseigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0417457", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5082"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Formates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0YIW783RG1", "NameOfSubstance": "formic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D149TYB5MK", "NameOfSubstance": "4-dichlorobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Formates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26411943", "10.1265/jjh.70.249"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
