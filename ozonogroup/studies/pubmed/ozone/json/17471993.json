The control group consisted of similar patients but without ozone pretreatment. OT efficacy was assessed by the rate of pyoinflammatory complications (PIC), results of immunological examination, positive changes in prostatic secretion, urine analysis, total blood count, degree ofbacteriuria. In the study group PIC (acute urethritis) developed in 1 patient, in the control--in 6 patients (3 cases of acute urethritis, 2 cases of acute prostatitis and 1 case of acute epididymitis). OT led to lowering of mean values of leukocyturia from 18.1 +/- 0.6 to 14.3 +/- 0.7 on the day of operation, to 10.9 +/- 0.7 after 4 days and to 8.7 +/- 0.6 on postoperative day 8 versus from 18.8 +/- 0.8 to 15.4 +/- 0.7, to 15.8 +/- 0.6 and 13.5 +/- 0.6, respectively. Mean control count of leukocytes in prostatic secretion fell in both groups. OT reduced bacteriuria. Number of bacteria to the day of operation decreased in both groups, but complete elimination of the agent from urine on day 8 was not achieved in the controls. The study group exhibited a rise in the absolute count of blood leukocytes, lymphocytes and ESR diminishing. OT raised significantly the phagocytic count and activity, concentration of mature T-lymphocytes (CD3), T-helpers (CD4), cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD8), B-lymphocytes (CD20), T-NK-cells (CD16), T-lymphocyte activation markers (CD3+, CD16+, CD56+, CD3+, CD25+, HLADR+, CD3+. The concentration of IgG, IgM, IgA remained high. Thus, the results of ozone application before PA TUR appeared promising in prevention of postoperative PIC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustafaev", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martov", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naumov", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siniukhin", "ForeName": "V N", "Initials": "VN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shakir", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merinov", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amelin", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al'bitskaia", "ForeName": "A Iu", "Initials": "AIu"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Controlled Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Urologiia", "NlmUniqueID": "100900900", "ISSNLinking": "1728-2985"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Therapy Modalities"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Postoperative Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Hyperplasia"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Suppuration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transurethral Resection of Prostate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17471993"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
