The results showed that GPP was higher during the middle of the growth period and low during the early and late growth periods, reaching a maximum of 40 \u03bcmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>. Using high and low ozone sensitivity settings,O<sub>3</sub>-damage in 150, 100, 50 nL\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> and control treatment (CK) reduced GPP by -72%, -36%, -6%, and -10%, and by -13%, -6%, -1%, and -2%, respectively.
