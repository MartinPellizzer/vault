Particle phase products formed within the first 3-22 s of reaction were analyzed online using a scanning mobility particle sizer and two particle mass spectrometers. The first, a photoionization aerosol mass spectrometer (PIAMS), was used to determine the molecular composition of nascent particles between 30 and 50 nm in diameter. The second, a nano-aerosol mass spectrometer (NAMS), was used to determine the elemental composition of individual particles from 50 nm to below 10 nm in diameter. Molecular composition measurements with PIAMS confirm that both the stabilized Criegee intermediate and hydroperoxide channels of alpha-pinene ozonolysis are operative. However, these channels alone cannot explain the high oxygen content of the particles measured with NAMS. The carbon-to-oxygen mole ratios of suspected nucleating agents are in the range of 2.25-4.0, while the measured ratios are from 1.9 for 9 nm particles to 2.5 and 2.7 for 30 and 50 nm particles, respectively. The large oxygen content may arise by cocondensation of small oxygenated molecules such as water or multistep reactions with ozone, water, or other species that produce highly oxygenated macromolecules. In either case, the increasing ratio with increasing particle size suggests that the aerosol becomes less polar with time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware 19716, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tolocka", "ForeName": "Michael P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heaton", "ForeName": "Katherine J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dreyfus", "ForeName": "Matthew A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shenyi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zordan", "ForeName": "Christopher A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saul", "ForeName": "Thomas D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "Murray V", "Initials": "MV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16570606", "10.1021/es051926f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
