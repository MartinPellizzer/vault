Moreover, few studies investigated ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). This study aimed to investigate the associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and executive function in Chinese children.", "In 2017, we randomly recruited 5028 children aged 6-12 years from 5 schools in Guangzhou city, southern China. Each of 5028 children's executive function were assessed using parent filled questionnaire. We further randomly selected 522 children to take computerized tests to assess working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. The 1-year average residence-based exposure to PM with diameters \u22642.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) or 10\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> exposures were estimated by using an inverse-distance weighting approach. Associations were evaluated by mixed linear regression models.", "The 1-year average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> was 39.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.12\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 60.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.49\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 53.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.44\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 12.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and 90.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.96\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Each interquartile range increment in PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with 48.04\u00a0ms [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18 to 93.89] increase in inhibitory control and 0.72 (95% CI: -1.14 to -0.29) points decrease in forward recall.

SO<sub>2</sub> exposure was associated with 0.69 (95%CI: 0.37 to 1.02) and 0.73 (95%CI: 0.40 to 1.05) high scores of behavioral regulation index and metacognition index, respectively. Significant association was found between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and metacognition index (estimate, 95%CI: 0.87, 0.45 to 1.29). No associations for cognitive flexibility were observed.
