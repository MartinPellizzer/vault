This research was performed to explore the potential synergy between ozone and PEF treatments against selected foodborne bacteria. Cells of Lactobacillus leichmannii ATCC 4797, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 35150, and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A were suspended in 0.1% NaCl and treated with ozone, PEF, and ozone plus PEE Cells were treated with 0.25 to 1.00 microg of ozone per ml of cell suspension, PEF at 10 to 30 kV/cm, and selected combinations of ozone and PEF. Synergy between ozone and PEF varied with the treatment level and the bacterium treated. L. leichmannii treated with PEF (20 kV/cm) after exposure to 0.75 and 1.00 microg/ml of ozone was inactivated by 7.1 and 7.2 log10 CFU/ml, respectively; however, ozone at 0.75 and 1.00 microg/ml and PEF at 20 kV/cm inactivated 2.2, 3.6, and 1.3 log10 CFU/ml, respectively. Similarly, ozone at 0.5 and 0.75 microg/ml inactivated 0.5 and 1.8 log10 CFU/ml of E. coli, PEF at 15 kV/cm inactivated 1.8 log10 CFU/ml, and ozone at 0.5 and 0.75 microg/ml followed by PEF (15 kV/cm) inactivated 2.9 and 3.6 log10 CFU/ml, respectively. Populations of L. monocytogenes decreased 0.1, 0.5, 3.0, 3.9, and 0.8 log10 CFU/ml when treated with 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 microg/ml of ozone and PEF (15 kV/cm), respectively; however, when the bacterium was treated with 15 kV/cm, after exposure to 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 microg/ml of ozone, 1.7, 2.0, and 3.9 log10 CFU/ml were killed, respectively. In conclusion, exposure of L. leichmannii, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes to ozone followed by the PEF treatment showed a synergistic bactericidal effect. This synergy was most apparent with mild doses of ozone against L. leichmannii."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Unal", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11403125", "10.4315/0362-028x-64.6.777", "S0362-028X(22)01331-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
