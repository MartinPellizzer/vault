High levels of microorganisms in the sap occur during holding, leading to a darker syrup with lower economic value. We investigated the use of dissolved ozone as a method to reduce the microbial population in sap. After 40 min of ozone treatment, concentrations of up to 0.30 mg/liter were achieved but were ineffective in reducing the aerobic plate count. Three predominant colonies on nutrient agar were selected for isolation and identification from sap. These included one mucoid and one nonmucoid yeast, both identified as Candida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. When suspended in buffer, each was readily inactivated by ozone. Addition of 3% sucrose to the buffer markedly reduced the effectiveness of ozone. With the use of an ozone generator with a larger ozone output, saturating ozone concentrations (1 mg/liter) were achieved within 5 min but were accompanied by only a 1-log reduction in aerobic plate count of maple sap. After 40 min of ozone treatment, a less than 3-log reduction occurred. The results indicate that, because of the presence of sucrose, ozone may be of limited use in reducing the microbial population in sap."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst 01003, USA. rlabbe@foodsci.umass.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Labbe", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinsley", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas fluorescens"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11198429", "10.4315/0362-028x-64.1.104", "S0362-028X(22)00665-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
