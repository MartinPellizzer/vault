Ozone therapy (OT) is systematically effective when pathological inflammatory and immunologic processes are activated. Among of these conditions are wound healing, macular degeneration related to aging, and conditions that are ischemic or infectious.", "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of OT on wound healing of intestinal anastomosis in the presence of peritonitis in a rat model.", "Animal experimentation.", "A total of 40 Wistar albino rats were randomized into four groups (n=10) including: sham (S), peritonitis (P), ozone 0 (O0), and ozone 24 (O24). In group S, only cecal dissection was carried out. The S group had only a cecal dissection and intestinal anastomosis performed, but no peritonitis. In all other groups, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) followed the cecal dissection to induce bacterial peritonitis. 24 h after puncture, a cecal resection and ileocolic anastomosis were performed. In group P, 24 h after CLP, a cecal resection and ileocolic anastomosis were performed and no ozone was administered. In group O0, immediately after the anastomosis, and in group O24, starting 24 hours after the anastomosis, an intraperitoneal 1 mg/kg/day ozone administration was applied for seven days. On the seventh day the animals were sacrificed, the anastomotic bursting pressures (BP) and the hydroxyproline values of the anastomotic tissues were measured, and histopathologic examination of the anastomotic segment was carried out.", "The highest BP was in group S, with 211\u00b123.13 mmHg. The mean BP of group P was 141\u00b156.25 mmHg, which was significantly lower than in the other two peritonitis groups that received ozone therapy, group O0 and O24, where it was 192\u00b122 and 166\u00b145 mmHg, respectively (p<0.05). The difference in the BP between groups O0 and O24 was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Histopathologic analyses of the anastomotic segments determined there was significantly more oedema and necrosis in the control group rats, and collagen deposition in the anastomotic tissue was significantly higher in the ozone-treated groups on postoperative day 7. Hydroxyproline levels were significantly higher in groups O0 and O24 compared to the peritonitis group (P).", "Ozone therapy has a beneficial effect on anastomotic healing of the colon in the presence of peritonitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, \u0130stanbul \u015ei\u015fli Etfal Training and Research Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Erginel", "ForeName": "Ba\u015fak", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, \u0130stanbul Training and Research Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Erginel", "ForeName": "Turgay", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, \u0130stanbul Training and Research Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aksoy", "ForeName": "Bilgin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, \u0130stanbul \u015ei\u015fli Etfal Training and Research Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Dokucu", "ForeName": "Ali \u0130hsan", "Initials": "A\u0130"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Balkan Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "101571817", "ISSNLinking": "2146-3123"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Vaneerdeweg W, Hendriks JMH, Lauwers PRM, Leven M, Eyskens EJM.
