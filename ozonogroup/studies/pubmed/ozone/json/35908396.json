Ozone might be a more effective oxidant to treat both high- and low-viability cyanobacteria than other common oxidants (e.g., chlorine, potassium permanganate). However, previous studies only conducted ozonation experiments using high-viability cyanobacteria, and potential influences of cell-viability on ozonation process, remains unknown. In this study, kinetics of ozone decay, cell inactivation, membrane destruction, and cyanotoxin fate of high- and low-viability Microcystis (the most common genus), was investigated, and associated mechanism was discussed. Results showed that low-viability Microcystis exhibited a higher rate constant of membrane destruction (665-744\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) than high-viability Microcystis (364-600\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) by equal concentrations of ozone, ascribed to loosely gelatinous sheath comprised with fewer organic matters as oxidant scavengers. Meanwhile, a higher rate constant of photosynthetic inactivation induced by ozonation, was observed for low-viability Microcystis (312-364\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) than that for high-viability Microcystis (168-294\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). However, elevated aromatic organics competitively inhibited microcystin ozonation for low-viability Microcystis, and hydroxyl radicals for microcystin oxidation could be reduced by elevated organic loads and alkalinity. Moreover, elevated ozone exposure (>51\u00a0mg\u00a0min\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) did not totally oxidize microcystin with a residual of 30\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> for low-viability Microcystis. These findings suggested that elevated microcystin risk would be the great barrier to limit ozonation application for low-viability Microcystis, even with benefits of higher cell inactivation compared to high-viability Microcystis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
