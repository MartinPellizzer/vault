However, it is important to acknowledge that certain conditions and system configurations may lead GUV systems to produce air contaminants including oxidants and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). In this study, we modeled the formation and dispersion of oxidants and secondary contaminants generated by the operation of GUV systems employing ultraviolet C 254 and 222 nm. Using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model, we examined the breathing zone concentrations of chemical species in an occupied classroom. Our findings indicate that operating GUV 222 leads to an approximate increase of 10 ppb in O<sub>3</sub> concentration and 5.2 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in SOA concentration compared to a condition without GUV operation, while GUV 254 increases the SOA concentration by about 1.2 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, with a minimal impact on the O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Furthermore, increasing the UV fluence rate of GUV 222 from 1 to 5 \u03bcW\u00b7cm<sup>-2</sup> results in up to 80% increase in the oxidants and SOA concentrations. For GUV 254, elevating the UV fluence rate from 30 to 50 \u03bcW\u00b7cm<sup>-2</sup> or doubling the radiating volume results in up to 50% increase in the SOA concentration. Note that indoor airflow patterns, particularly buoyancy-driven airflow (or displacement ventilation), lead to 15-45% lower SOA concentrations in the breathing zone compared to well-mixed airflow. The results also reveal that when the ventilation rate is below 2 h<sup>-1</sup>, operating GUV 254 has a smaller impact on human exposure to secondary contaminants than GUV 222. However, GUV 254 may generate more contaminants than GUV 222 when operating at high indoor O<sub>3</sub> levels (>15 ppb). These results suggest that the design of GUV systems should consider indoor O<sub>3</sub> levels and room ventilation conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Architectural Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Seongjun", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Architectural Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States."}], "LastName": "Won", "ForeName": "Youngbo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0751-3605"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Architectural Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, United States."}], "LastName": "Rim", "ForeName": "Donghyun", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38922431", "10.1021/acs.est.4c00575"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
