Changes in these parameters over a 72-hour time period were correlated with the development of symptoms of ozone toxicity. Toxicity symptoms normally appeared within 24 hours. The content of ATP and total adenylates increased immediately following a 3-hour exposure to ozone. Photosynthesis was depressed initially, but returned to normal within 24 hours. Respiration was not always altered initially, but it was significantly stimulated within 24 hours. We interpret the results to mean that the changes in adenylate content and photosynthesis are early events in the initiation of ozone damage and that the change in respiration is a consequence rather than a cause of cellular injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Rutgers University-The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brennan", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1950 Apr;25(2):354-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16654296"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1967 May;42(5):691-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16656557"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1969 Apr;44(4):605-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16657107"]}, {"Citation": "Phytopathology. 1968 Jun;58(6):808-10", "ArticleIdList": ["5662383"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1973", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1974", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16658333", "PMC366268", "10.1104/pp.51.2.378"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
