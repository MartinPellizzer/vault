Prediction models for kO3 were developed for aromatic compounds, olefins, and amines by quantum chemical molecular orbital calculations employing ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (B3LYP) methods. The kO3 values for aromatic compounds correlated well with the energy of a delocalized molecular orbital first appearing on an aromatic ring (i.e., the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or HOMO-n (n \u2265 0) when the HOMO is not located on the aromatic ring); the number of compounds tested (N) was 112, and the correlation coefficient (R(2)) values were 0.82-1.00. The kO3 values for olefins and amines correlated well with the energy of a localized molecular orbital (i.e., the natural bond orbital (NBO)) energy of the carbon-carbon \u03c0 bond of olefins (N = 45, R(2) values of 0.82-0.85) and the NBO energy of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons of amines (N = 59, R(2) values of 0.81-0.83), respectively. Considering the performance of the kO3 prediction model and the computational costs, the HF/6-31G method is recommended for all aromatic groups and olefins investigated herein, whereas the HF/MIDI!, HF/6-31G*, or HF/6-311++G** methods are recommended for amines. Based on their mean absolute errors, the above models could predict kO3 within a factor of 4, on average, relative to the experimentally determined values. Overall, good correlations were also observed (R(2) values of 0.77-0.96) between kO3 predictions by quantum molecular orbital descriptors in this study and by the Hammett (\u03c3) and Taft (\u03c3*) constants from previously developed quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. Hence, the quantum molecular orbital descriptors are an alternative to \u03c3 and \u03c3*-values in QSAR applications and can also be utilized to estimate unknown \u03c3 or \u03c3*-values. \u202f."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Minju", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Zimmermann-Steffens", "ForeName": "Saskia G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Ueberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 Duebendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Arey", "ForeName": "J Samuel", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Ueberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 Duebendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics, ETH Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Fenner", "ForeName": "Kathrin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Ueberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 Duebendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics, ETH Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26121114", "10.1021/acs.est.5b00902"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
