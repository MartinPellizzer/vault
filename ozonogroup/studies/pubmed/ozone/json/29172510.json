The abatement patterns of TrOCs had inflected shapes, controlled by the reactivity of TrOCs toward ozone and HO<sup>\u2022</sup> radicals. These novel and generic correlation models will be of importance for WRRF operators to reduce operational costs and minimize byproduct formation. Both UVA<sub>254</sub> and fluorescence surrogates could be used to control \u0394TrOC, although fluorescence measurements indicated a slightly better reproducibility and an enlarged control range. The generic framework was validated for several WRRFs and correlations for any compound with known kinetic information could be developed solely using the second order reaction rate constant with ozone (k<sub>O3</sub>). Two distinct reaction phases were defined for which separate linear correlations were obtained. The first was mainly ozone controlled, while the second phase was more related to HO<sup>\u2022</sup> reactions. Furthermore, parallel factor analysis of the fluorescence spectra enabled monitoring of multiple types of organic matter with different O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sup>\u2022</sup> reactivity. This knowledge is of value for kinetic modeling frameworks and for achieving a better understanding of the occurring changes of organic matter during ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Industrial Biological Sciences, Ghent University Campus Kortrijk , Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2337-1667"], "LastName": "Chys", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Industrial Biological Sciences, Ghent University Campus Kortrijk , Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Audenaert", "ForeName": "Wim T M", "Initials": "WTM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Industrial Biological Sciences, Ghent University Campus Kortrijk , Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EnVOC, Department of Sustainable Organic Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deniere", "ForeName": "Emma", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BIOMATH, Department of Mathematical Modelling, Statistics and Bioinformatics, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, Ghent University , Ottergemsesteenweg 460, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortier", "ForeName": "S\u00e9verine Th\u00e9r\u00e8se F C", "Initials": "STFC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EnVOC, Department of Sustainable Organic Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Langenhove", "ForeName": "Herman", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BIOMATH, Department of Mathematical Modelling, Statistics and Bioinformatics, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nopens", "ForeName": "Ingmar", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EnVOC, Department of Sustainable Organic Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demeestere", "ForeName": "Kristof", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Industrial Biological Sciences, Ghent University Campus Kortrijk , Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Hulle", "ForeName": "Stijn W H", "Initials": "SWH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29172510", "10.1021/acs.est.7b04905"]}}]}
