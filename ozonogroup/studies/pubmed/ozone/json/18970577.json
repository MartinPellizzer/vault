This biosensor is based on an indirect inhibition immunoassay which takes place at a chemically modified optical transducer chip. The spatially resolved modification of the transducer surface allows the simultaneous determination of selected target analytes by means of \"total internal reflection fluorescence\" (TIRF). The performance of the immunosensor method developed was evaluated against a well accepted traditional method based on solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The chromatographic method was superior in terms of linearity, sensitivity and accuracy, and the biosensor method in terms of repeatability, speed, cost and automation. The application of both methods in parallel to determine the occurrence and removal of atrazine, isoproturon and estrone throughout the treatment process (sand filtration, ozonation, activated carbon filtration and chlorination) in a waterworks showed an overestimation of results in the case of the biosensor, which was partially attributed to matrix and cross-reactivity effects, in spite of the addition of ovalbumin to the sample to minimize matrix interferences. Based on the comparative performance of both techniques, the biosensor emerges as a suitable tool for fast, simple and automated screening of water pollutants without sample pretreatment. To the author's knowledge, this is the first description of the application of the biosensor RIANA in the multi-analyte configuration to the regular monitoring of pollutants in a waterworks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Chemistry, IIQAB-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, C/ Jordi Girona Salgado 18-26, Barcelona, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodriguez-Mozaz", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Alda", "ForeName": "Maria J L\u00f3pez", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barcel\u00f3", "ForeName": "Dami\u00e0", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Talanta", "NlmUniqueID": "2984816R", "ISSNLinking": "0039-9140"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18970577", "10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.050", "S0039-9140(05)00666-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
