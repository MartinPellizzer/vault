Results showed that ZIF-67-derived Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite maintained the polyhedral structure of ZIF-67. After modification, abundant amorphous FeOOH nanowire attached on the surface of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite, resulting in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@FeOOH interwoven polyhedrons. Furthermore, the specific surface area of the formed composite was about 2.5 times that of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite, which might provide more active sites for catalytic reaction. Compared with single ozonation system, the catalytic ozonation process (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@FeOOH/O<sub>3</sub>) had better performance in NOF mineralization under the same operating conditions. Moreover, in the presence of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@FeOOH, faster O<sub>3</sub> decomposition and higher \u2022OH concentration were observed, which could explain the significant enhancement of TOC removal. The co-existence of Fe and Co in various valence states in catalyst might improve the conversion of Co(III)/Co(II) and Fe(III)/Fe(II), which would increase the catalytic activity in catalytic ozonation process. Besides, several main intermediate products were detected and possible NOF degradation pathway was proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
