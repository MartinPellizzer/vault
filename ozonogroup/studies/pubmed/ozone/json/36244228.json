We examined the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and mortality from dementia, psychiatric disorders, and suicide in seven European cohorts. Within the multicenter project 'Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe' (ELAPSE), we pooled data from seven European cohorts from six countries. Based on the residential addresses, annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), black carbon (BC), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and 8 PM<sub>2.5</sub> components were estimated using Europe-wide hybrid land-use regression models. We applied stratified Cox proportional hazard models to investigate the associations between air pollution and mortality from dementia, psychiatric disorders, and suicide. Of 271,720 participants, 900 died from dementia, 241 from psychiatric disorders, and 164 from suicide, during a mean follow-up of 19.7\u00a0years. In fully adjusted models, we observed positive associations of NO<sub>2</sub> (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a01.38; 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13, 1.70 per 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.29; 95\u00a0% CI: 0.98, 1.71 per 5\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), and BC (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.37; 95\u00a0% CI: 1.11, 1.69 per 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup>/m) with psychiatric disorders mortality, as well as with suicide (NO<sub>2</sub>: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.13 [95\u00a0% CI: 0.92, 1.38]; PM<sub>2.5</sub>: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.19 [95\u00a0% CI: 0.76, 1.87]; BC: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.08 [95\u00a0% CI: 0.87, 1.35]), and no association with dementia mortality. We did not detect any positive associations of O<sub>3</sub> and 8 PM<sub>2.5</sub> components with any of the three mortality outcomes. Long-term exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and BC may lead to premature mortality from psychiatric disorders and suicide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
