The atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) is an important meteorological parameter for the sources and sinks of air pollutants. It is generally recognized that the reduction of boundary layer is conducive to the accumulation of pollutants. However, in recent years, some studies have shown that the relationship between ABLH and ozone is not negatively correlated. Here, we analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone exceedance in China from 2015 to 2022. The relationships between particulate pollution and ozone pollution and boundary layer meteorology were discussed. The key to coordinated control is to control the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in the winter and ozone in summer. Moreover, the two have different responses to meteorological factors, especially to the ABLH. Low temperature and low ABLH are conducive to the deterioration of particulate pollution, but high temperature and high ABLH are conducive to the occurrence and development of ozone pollution. The response of ozone to ABLH is contrary to previous studies in Europe and the United States. Moreover, an abnormal positive correlation was observed for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ABLH in Southwest China, which was mainly due to the impact of biomass combustion in Southeast Asia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
