The membrane potential of these cells is mainly maintained by the interplay of potassium and chloride currents. Our previous studies indicated the ability of O<sub>3</sub> to activate ORCC (Outward Rectifier Chloride Channel) and consequently increases the chloride current. In this paper our aim was to understand the response of potassium current to oxidative stress challenge and to identify the kind potassium channel involved in O<sub>3</sub> induced current changes. After measuring the total membrane current using an intracellular solution with or without potassium ions, we obtained the contribution of potassium to the overall membrane current in control condition by a mathematical approach. Repeating these experiments after O<sub>3</sub> treatment we observed a significant decrease of I<sub>potassium</sub>. Treatment of the cells with Iberiotoxin (IbTx), a specific inhibitor of BK channel, we were able to verify the presence and the functionality of BK channels. In addition, the administration of 4-Aminopyridine (an inhibitor of voltage dependent K channels but not BK channels) and Tetraethylammonium (TEA) before and after O<sub>3</sub> treatment we observed the formation of BK oxidative post-translation modifications. Our data suggest that O<sub>3</sub> is able to inhibit potassium current by targeting BK channel. Further studies are needed to better clarify the role of this BK channel and its interplay with the other membrane channels under oxidative stress conditions. These findings can contribute to identify the biomolecular pathway induced by O<sub>3</sub> allowing a possible pharmacological intervention against oxidative stress damage in lung tissue."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
