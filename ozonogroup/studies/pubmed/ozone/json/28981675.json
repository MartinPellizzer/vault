In this study, ozone was applied in the gaseous form to control two species of pests in stored dried figs. The samples of figs (50\u2009g each) were infested with adults of Oryzaephilus surinamensis L. and larvae of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller and were subjected to different combinations of ozone concentrations (2, 3, and 5\u2009ppm) and exposure times (15, 30, 45, 60, and 90\u2009min). Changes in organoleptic properties (color, sweetness, firmness, aroma, and overall acceptability) during ozonation were studied. The results showed that the mortality rate increased with an increase in ozone concentration and exposure time. The total mortality of both pests was achieved at an ozone concentration of 5\u2009ppm and exposure time of 90\u2009min. Sensory evaluation showed that ozone only had a negligible effect on aroma. Therefore, the usage of ozone is recommended during the postharvest process instead of other chemical fumigants, such as methyl bromide and phosphine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author 2017.
