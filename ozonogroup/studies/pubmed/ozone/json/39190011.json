Considering the critical role of the degree of unsaturation in lipid oxidation, this study investigates NTP-induced oxidation across various unsaturated lipids. These lipids are six oil samples primarily containing one of the following methylesters: oleate, linoleate, linolenate, arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate. Samples were treated with a nonthermal surface dielectric barrier discharge. Plasma-induced effects were first examined by classical lipid oxidation indicators, such as the peroxide value and <i>p</i>-anisidine value. The specific volatile oxidation products, including hexanal, nonanal, trans-2-hexenal, and methyl 9-oxononanoate, were determined to further elucidate the impact of ozone-related oxidation. Monitoring the production of selected nonvolatile oxidation products, such as epoxy-, oxo-, and hydroxy fatty acid methylesters, confirmed that plasma treatment facilitated the decomposition of lipid hydroperoxide. Generally, the level of plasma-induced oxidation increased in parallel with the unsaturation degree of the studied samples, except for the quantity of individual volatile carbonyls. The long-term effect of NTP treatment was investigated by a stability test, revealing that the oxidative stability depended on the input gas of plasma treatment, the sensitivity of the treated sample, and the presence of antioxidants. Except for the focus on the NTP impact, this study offered a case study of a comprehensive investigation into lipid oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent 9000, Belgium."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6300-3044"], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Danyang", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent 9000, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sierens", "ForeName": "Joke", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent 9000, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haydamous", "ForeName": "Christelle", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Unit Plasma Technology (RUPT), Department of Applied Physics, Ghent University, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent 9000, Belgium."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2255-6419"], "LastName": "Nikiforov", "ForeName": "Anton", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Unit Plasma Technology (RUPT), Department of Applied Physics, Ghent University, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent 9000, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Geyter", "ForeName": "Nathalie", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent 9000, Belgium."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0121-5567"], "LastName": "De Meulenaer", "ForeName": "Bruno", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39190011", "10.1021/acs.jafc.4c04365"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
