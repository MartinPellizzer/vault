Outperforming the conventional <sup>\u2022</sup>OH-based catalytic ozonation process, O<sub>3</sub>/NHC not only realized an enhancement of the pseudo-first-order rate constant of 11 times in comparison with that of O<sub>3</sub> alone, but was also endowed with a high stability over a wide pH (4-9) and temperature (15-35 \u00b0C) range for the degradation of KTP. The high graphitization degree (<i>I</i><sub>D</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>G</sub> = 0.78-0.88) and low unsaturated oxygen content (0.10-1.38%) of NHC highlighted the dominant role of N-heteroatoms in the O<sub>3</sub>/NHC system. The specific effects of different N species were confirmed by a relationship study (N property vs catalytic activity) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization. The graphitic N forming in the bulk of the graphitic structure served as the \"electron-mobility\" region to promote KTP degradation with the transfer of electrons from the KTP molecule to O<sub>3</sub> via a nonradical reaction process. The pyrrolic and pyridinic N located at defects of the graphitic structure acted as the \"radical-generation\" region to decompose O<sub>3</sub> into <sup>\u2022</sup>OH for degrading KTP by a radical oxidation process. This finding provided a brand new insight into engineering N-doped carbonaceous catalysts precisely in the catalytic ozonation process for the efficient treatment of organic-contaminated water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhiqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Ministry of Education, School of Urban Construction and Environmental Engineering , Chongqing University , Chongqing 400044 , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Caihong", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhen", "ForeName": "Yufei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0903-5547"], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "90Y4QC304K", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketoprofen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ketoprofen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31392886", "10.1021/acs.est.9b02745"]}}]}
