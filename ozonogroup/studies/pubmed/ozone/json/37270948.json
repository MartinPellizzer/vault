This study investigated the impact of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)- biologically active filtration (BAF) as integral components of non-reverse osmosis (RO)-based potable reuse treatment trains and as a potential pretreatment option to improve adsorptive PFAA removal from wastewater effluent by nonselective (e.g., granular activated carbon (GAC) and selective (e.g., anionic exchange resins (AER) and surface-modified clay (SMC)) adsorbents. For nonselective GAC, O<sub>3</sub> and BAF resulted in similar PFAA removal improvements, while BAF alone performed better than O<sub>3</sub> for AER and SMC. O<sub>3</sub>-BAF in tandem resulted in the highest PFAA removal performance improvement among pretreatments investigated for selective and nonselective adsorbents. Side by side evaluation of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) breakthrough curves and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for each pretreatment scenario suggested that despite the higher affinity of selective adsorbents towards PFAAs, the competition between PFAA and effluent organic matter (EfOM) (molecular weights (MWs): 100-1000\u00a0Da) negatively impacts the performance of these adsorbents. The SEC results also demonstrated that transformation of hydrophobic EfOM to more hydrophilic molecules during O<sub>3</sub> and biotransformation of EfOM during BAF were the dominant mechanisms responsible for alleviating the competition between PFAA and EfOM, resulting in PFAA removal improvement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
