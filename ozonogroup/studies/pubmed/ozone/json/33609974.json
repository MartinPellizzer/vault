Purpose of this study is to integrate ozone with microalgal biotreatment to achieve effective removal of both organic compounds and nutrients with one-step biodegradation and obtain high quality effluent dischargeable to municipal sewage system. Results showed that ozone pretreatment removed 35.0-90.2% color and inactivated 1.8-4.7 log CFU/mL bacteria in MPW. In post biotreatment using microalgae co-immobilized with activated sludge (ACS) bacteria, bacterial growth in ozone pretreated wastewater (7.1-8.1 log CFU/mL) were higher than non-pretreated control (6.0 log CFU/mL) due to enhanced biodegradability of wastewater pollutants. Algal biomass growth in wastewater pretreated with 0.5 (2489.3\u00a0mg/L) and 1 (2582.0\u00a0mg/L) minute's ozonation were improved and higher than control (2297.1\u00a0mg/L). Ozone pretreatment significantly improved nutrients removal. Following ozone pretreatment of 0.5\u00a0min, microalgal biotreatment removed 60.1% soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), 79.5% total nitrogen (TN) and 91.9% total phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) which were higher than control (34.4% sCOD, 63.4% TN, 77.6% total PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>). Treated effluent contained 342.3\u00a0mg/L sCOD, 28.8\u00a0mg/L TN, 9.9\u00a0mg/L total PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and could be discharged into municipal sewage system. However, excessive ozone pretreatment displayed adverse impact on algal growth and sCOD removal. Therefore, integration of 0.5\u00a0min's ozone pretreatment with microalgae-based biotreatment is an efficient on-site treatment to simultaneously remove organic compounds and nutrients with one-step biodegradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
