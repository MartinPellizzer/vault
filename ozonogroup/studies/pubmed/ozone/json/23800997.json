Its use is banned in many countries because of its ozone-depleting properties. Despite this ban, the use of MeBr persists in some parts of the world (e.g. New Zealand) due to its important role in maintaining strict biosecurity of exported and imported products. Its high chemical reactivity leads to a broad toxicological profile ranging from acute respiratory toxicity following inhalation exposure, through carcinogenicity to neurotoxicty. In this article, we discuss the chemistry of MeBr in the context of its mechanisms of toxicity. The chemical reactivity of MeBr clearly underlies its toxicity. Bromine (Br) is electronegative and a good leaving group; the \u03b4+ carbon thus facilitates electrophilic methylation of biological molecules including glutathione (GSH) via its \u03b4- sulphur atom, leading to downstream effects due to GSH depletion. DNA alkylation, either directly by MeBr or indirectly due to reduction in GSH-mediated detoxification of reactive alkylating chemical species, might explain the carcinogenicity of MeBr. The neurotoxicity of MeBr is much more difficult to understand, but we speculate that methyl phosphates formed in cells might contribute to its neurone-specific toxicity via cholinesterase inhibition. Finally, evidence reviewed shows that it is unlikely for Br\u207b liberated by the metabolism of MeBr to have any toxicological effect because the Br\u207b dose is very low."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bulathsinghala", "ForeName": "A T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shaw", "ForeName": "I C", "Initials": "IC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flame Retardants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Flame Retardants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxicity Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone Depletion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23800997", "10.1177/0960327113493299", "0960327113493299"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
