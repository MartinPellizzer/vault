In this study, a set of national-provincial-gridded (1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0) emission estimation methods were built and applied to obtain the national, provincial, and gridded emission inventories in China in 1990-2019. In addition, the HCFC-22 emission reduction potential of different emission scenarios was analyzed. The results show that China's HCFC-22 emissions reached a peak in 2017 and that the cumulative emissions in 1990-2019 were 1576.8 (1348.2-1819.0) kt (equivalent to 86.7 kt CFC-11 and 2854.1 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>). China's HCFC-22 emissions in the east were higher than those in the west, and the emissions in the south were higher than those in the north. Under the control of the Montreal Protocol, China will reduce the cumulative emissions of 17\u202f840.8 kt (avoiding 0.08\u00b0 of global warming by 2056) in 2020-2056. If the disposal refrigerant can be effectively recycled in the future, the HCFC-22 emission reduction in this period will reach 18\u202f020.3 kt. The established emission estimation methods and obtained results can provide scientific and technological support for ozone layer protection and for addressing climate change."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The MOE Key Laboratory of Resource and Environmental System Optimization, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, P.
