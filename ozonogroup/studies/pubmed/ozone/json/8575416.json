The extracts were 2-8 times more mutagenic in TA100 than in TA98, and the mutagenic potencies of the water extracts ranked similarly in both strains: Cl2 > O3 + Cl2 > NH2Cl > O3 + NH2Cl > O3 > raw. 3-Chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), which was estimated to account for approximately 20% of the mutagenic activity of the extracts, was shown to be the most potent compound tested thus far in a prophage-induction assay in Escherichia coli and a forward-mutation assay in Salmonella TM677. The mutations in approximately 2,000 revertants of TA98 and TA100 induced by MX and the water extracts were analyzed by colony probe hybridization and polymerase chain reaction/DNA sequence analysis. The water extracts and MX produced similar mutation spectra, which consisted in TA100 of predominantly of GC-->TA transversions in the second position of the CCC (or GGG) target of the hisG46 allele. This spectrum resembles that produced by large aromatic compounds and is distinct from that produced by alkylating agents and the semivolatile drinking water mutagen dichloroacetic acid. In TA98, MX and those water extracts resulting from the introduction of the chlorine atom produced 50-70% hotspot 2-base deletions and 30-50% complex frameshifts (frameshifts with an adjacent base substitution--mostly GC-->TA transversions as found in TA100). No other compound or mixture is known to induce such high frequencies of complex frameshifts. These results suggest that MX and \"MX-like\" compounds (possibly halogenated aromatics, such as halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) account for much of the mutagenic activity and specificity of the nonvolatile organics in drinking water and that these halogenated organics are especially capable of promoting misincorporation by the DNA replication complex. This study provides further evidence that the mutation spectrum of a complex mixture reflects the dominance of one or a few classes of chemical mutagens within the mixture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Carcinogenesis Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeMarini", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abu-Shakra", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Felton", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patterson", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shelton", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "77439-76-0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KW8K411A1P", "NameOfSubstance": "chloramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8575416", "10.1002/em.2850260403"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
