The adsorption behavior of twelve kinds of simulated radionuclides (Mn, Co, Sr, Y, Ru, Rh, Sb, Te, Cs, Ba, Eu, and I (I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)) on these composite adsorbents has been studied in real river water at room temperature. PA316TAS adsorbents showed much higher distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>) for all metal ions. TAS structure has more selective adsorption ability for Mn, Co, Sr, Y, Cs, Ba, Eu, and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. On the other hand, Y, Ru, Rh, Sb, Te, Eu, I (I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) were adsorbed on both PA316 and TAS structures. To evaluate the validity of these mechanistic expectations, the respective chemical adsorption behaviors of Mn, Co, Sr, etc. and PA316TAS adsorbent were examined in river water ranging in temperature from 278 to 333\u00a0K. As was expected, one adsorption mechanism for Mn, Co, Sr, Cs, and Ba systems and two types of adsorption mechanisms for Y, Ru, Rh, Sb, Te, Eu, I (I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) systems were observed. On the other hand, the precipitation of Mn, Co, Y, Ru, Rh, Te, and Eu was formed by ozonation for river water, that is, ozone can transform Mn, Co, Y, Ru, Rh, Te, and Eu ions into the insoluble precipitates. Hence, one straight line for Sr, Cs, Ba systems and two types of straight lines for Sb, I (I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) systems were obtained in river water treated with ozone. The chromatography experiments of Cs, Sr, I (I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) were carried out to calculate their maximum adsorption capacities. The obtained maximum adsorption capacities of Cs, Sr, and I<sup>-</sup> mixed with IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> (Cs), 1.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup> (Cs/O<sub>3</sub>), 7.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup> (Sr), 5.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> (Sr/O<sub>3</sub>), 5.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup> (I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), 3.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup> (I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/O<sub>3</sub>) mol/g - PA316TAS. It was discovered that the maximum adsorption capacities of I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> for the composite adsorbent is unprecedented high and the capacity become much greater than an order of magnitude, compared with those of previous reports. This phenomenon suggests the formation of electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes or pseudo EDA complex. Based on these results, it was concluded that the combined use of tannic acid-type organic composite adsorbents and ozone made it possible to remove simultaneously and effectively various kinds of radionuclides in river water in the wide pH and temperature ranges."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
