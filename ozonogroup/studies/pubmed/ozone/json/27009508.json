Seed-borne disease refers to plant diseases that are transmitted by seeds; seed disinfection is an important technique for prevention of such diseases. In this study, the effectiveness of low-pressure plasma treatment in the inactivation of the seed-borne plant pathogenic bacterium, Xanthomonas campestris, inoculated on cruciferous seeds, was evaluated. The highest inactivation effect was observed when the treatment voltage and argon gas flow rate were 5.5 kV and 0.5 L/min, respectively. The viable cell number of X. campestris was 6.6 log cfu/seed before plasma treatment, and decreased by 3.9 log after 5 min of treatment and by 6.6 log after 40 min. Ethidium monoazide treatment and quantitative real-time PCR results indicated that both the cell membrane and target DNA region were damaged following 5 min of plasma treatment. Although both heat and ozone were generated during the plasma treatment, the contribution of both factors to the inactivation of X. campestris was small by itself in our low-pressure plasma system. Overall, we have shown that our low-pressure plasma system has great applicability to controlling plant pathogenic bacterium contamination of seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environment, Agriculture and Fisheries, Osaka Prefecture."}], "LastName": "Nishioka", "ForeName": "Terumi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takai", "ForeName": "Yuichiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mishima", "ForeName": "Tomoko", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawaradani", "ForeName": "Mitsuo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanimoto", "ForeName": "Hideo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okada", "ForeName": "Kiyotsugu", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Misawa", "ForeName": "Tatsuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kusakari", "ForeName": "Shinichi", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biocontrol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9712121", "ISSNLinking": "1342-4815"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xanthomonas campestris"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27009508", "10.4265/bio.21.37"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
