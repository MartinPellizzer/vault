We investigated the presence of any potential correlation between exposure to air pollution and outpatient admission for blepharitis in Shanghai, China. Data on daily outpatient admission for blepharitis were collected from January 2017 to July 2022. Air pollution and meteorological data were acquired from the Shanghai Environmental Protection Agency. Using the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) we investigated the relationship between air pollutants and blepharitis. Seasonal stratified analysis was carried out. In total, 10,681 blepharitis patients were recruited. In the single-pollutant model, a 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in particulate matter with < 2.5 \u03bcm PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 10 \u03bcm PM<sub>10</sub> along with sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and 100 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in carbon monoxide (CO) was significantly associated with outpatient visits for blepharitis. In the multi-pollutant model, a 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and a 100 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in carbon monoxide (CO) was significantly associated with outpatient visits for blepharitis. Moreover, there was an obvious relationship between blepharitis and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the summers and blepharitis and PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> during the winters. Exposure to short-term air pollution increases the risk of blepharitis outpatient visits in Shanghai, China."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
