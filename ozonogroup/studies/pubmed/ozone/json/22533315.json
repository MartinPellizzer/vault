Milled wood lignin (MWL) was isolated from each species using a modified protocol and all milled wood lignin preparations were analyzed through quantitative (13)C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, methoxyl analysis, sugar analysis, and nitrobenzene oxidation. Nitrobenzene oxidation and ozonation were carried out on extractive-free wood, alkali-extracted wood, milled wood lignin, and alkali-extracted lignin. Milled wood lignin isolated by the modified protocol was found to be representative of the total lignin in alkali-extracted wood. Significant variations in lignin structures, such as syringylpropane/guaiacylpropane ratio (S/G ratio), arylglycerol-\u03b2-aryl ether (\u03b2-O-4), degree of condensation, and elemental and methoxyl contents, were found among the hardwood species studied. These structural variations among species appear to be correlated to a single factor, the syringyl/guaiacyl ratio. A new method to predict the S/G ratio of total lignin in wood was developed, using a calibration line established by the syringaldehyde/vanillin (S/V) ratio (nitrobenzene oxidation) and the S/G ratio ((13)C NMR) of milled wood lignin (MWL)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Biomaterials, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27606, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Ricardo B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Capanema", "ForeName": "Ewellyn A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balakshin", "ForeName": "Mikhail Yu", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hou-min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jameel", "ForeName": "Hasan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22533315", "10.1021/jf301276a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
