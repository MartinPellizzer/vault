These experimental animal studies provided useful perspectives of plausible, but more subtle pathologic outcomes having relevance to lifestyle exposure to gaseous environmental irritants including tobacco smoke.", "Freeze-fracture technology was applied to ultrastructural examination of large airway epithelium, with appropriate controls, from guinea pigs exposed to ozone and of nasal mucosa of human subjects exposed to ozone or sulfur dioxide, and nasal mucosa of active smokers.", "We documented substantive membrane structural changes to tight junctional complexes and cilia as well as an infiltrate of neutrophils into the surface mucosal layer in exposed animals. These patterns also were evident but not as pervasive among human subjects acutely exposed experimentally to irritant gases and those chronically exposed by their lifestyle to tobacco smoke.", "Our intent was to characterize respiratory tract mucosal membrane disorganization associated with high level acute irritant exposures in an experimental animal model and to evaluate evidence of similar but perhaps more subtle pathologic change associated with lower level experimental or lifestyle exposures. Our studies demonstrate continuity, albeit subtle, of pathologic change from high dosage experimental animal exposure to low dosage human exposures.", "This study represents the first report of ultrastructural airway epithelial membrane anomalies associated with lifestyle exposure to tobacco smoke irritants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. jcarson@med.unc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carson", "ForeName": "Johnny L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brighton", "ForeName": "Luisa E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Collier", "ForeName": "Albert M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bromberg", "ForeName": "Philip A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K5161X06LL", "NameOfSubstance": "Cotinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biopsy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Cotinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Fracturing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Style"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "blood", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Tight Junctions"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23421485", "10.3109/08958378.2013.763314"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
