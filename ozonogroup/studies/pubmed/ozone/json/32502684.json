Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) was analyzed as the research subject through different experiments in laboratory. The degradation effect of organic compounds by O<sub>3</sub> and UV/O<sub>3</sub> processes in different air distribution methods was compared independently, and the mechanism of free radical generation by the two processes was analyzed. This study found that the combined UV/O<sub>3</sub> process for organic matter mineralization is clearly better than that of independent effect of O<sub>3</sub> process as mixed gas-liquid distribution method was superior to the bubble aeration method. The experimental conditions included inlet O<sub>3</sub> concentration between 70 and 75\u00a0mg/L, reactor internal relative pressure at 0.3\u00a0MPa, contact reaction time of 12\u00a0min, DMP mineralization efficiency reaching 63.07%. The calculated dosing ratio of O<sub>3</sub> in the dynamic experiment was around 0.74\u00a0mg COD<sub>Cr</sub>/mg O<sub>3</sub>. The results showed that the best effect in wastewater treatment was achieved when the conditions of ultraviolet lamp irradiation intensity and the O<sub>3</sub> dosage reached 822.88\u00a0W/m<sup>2</sup> 15\u00a0mg/L and utilized in conjunction with biochemical reactions. The resulting COD<sub>Cr</sub> concentration of effluent reached 39.8\u00a0mg/L. Finally, it is determined that the main influence factors affecting the economically efficient operation of UV/O<sub>3</sub> process were the efficient O<sub>3</sub> distribution mode, control of the relative pressure within the reactor, proportion of ozone addition and light source configuration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
