Such an explosion produces pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO <sub><i>x</i></sub> ). The most common NO <sub><i>x</i></sub> is nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), which is present in the atmosphere due to natural and anthropogenic processes. The presence of NO<sub>2</sub> is used as indicator of air pollution. However, the specific contribution of NO<sub>2</sub> to air quality is uncertain due to the presence of other constituents, especially particulate matter (PM10). Research has shown that extended exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> may result in serious health effects. This study investigated the impact of the explosion on NO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere above Beirut and the surrounding area. NO<sub>2</sub> data from the Sentinel-5P program were used to map the levels of NO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, ground-monitoring data were used to assess the levels of PM10 and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) due to the evident association between these constituents and NO<sub>2</sub>. Results showed that NO<sub>2</sub> levels were higher than before the blast. However, 7\u00a0days after the explosion, NO<sub>2</sub> levels had returned to normal, while the levels of PM10 and O<sub>3</sub> remained normal following the explosion. However, a slight increase in the daily average atmospheric pressure was noticed after the explosion, which was attributed to the decomposition of ammonium nitrate."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411365.4", "0000 0001 2218 0143"], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, American University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Tarig", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411365.4", "0000 0001 2218 0143"], "Affiliation": "Department Biology, Chemistry and Environmental Sciences, American University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Abouleish", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411365.4", "0000 0001 2218 0143"], "Affiliation": "GIS and Mapping Lab, American University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Gawai", "ForeName": "Rahul", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411365.4", "0000 0001 2218 0143"], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, American University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Hamdan", "ForeName": "Nasser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8820-6649"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.24805.3b", "0000 0001 0687 2182"], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM USA."}], "LastName": "Elaksher", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "EuroMediterr J Environ Integr", "NlmUniqueID": "101766402", "ISSNLinking": "2365-7448"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abbey DE, Colome SD, Mills PK, Burchette R, Beeson WL, Tian Y.
