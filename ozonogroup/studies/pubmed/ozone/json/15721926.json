The porous structure of the ozone-treated carbons remained practically unchanged with regard to the virgin GAC. However, important modifications of the chemical surface and hydrophobicity were observed from FTIR spectroscopy, pH titrations, and determination of pH(PZC). As a rule, the ozone treatment at either room temperature (i.e., about 25 degrees C) or 100 degrees C gave rise to acidic surface oxygen groups (SOG). At 25 degrees C primarily carboxylic acids were formed while a more homogeneous distribution of carboxylic, lactonic, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups was obtained at 100 degrees C. The experimental isotherms for phenolic compounds on both GAC were analyzed using the Langmuir model. Dispersive interactions between pi electrons of the ring of the aromatics and those of the carbon basal planes were thought to be the primary forces responsible for the physical adsorption whereas oxidative coupling of phenolic compounds catalyzed by basic SOG was a major cause of irreversible adsorption. The exposure of both GAC to ozone at room temperature decreased their ability to adsorb P, PNP, and PCP. However, when ozone was applied at 100 degrees C adsorption was not prevented but in some cases (P and PNP on F400) the adsorption process was even enhanced."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Energ\u00e9tica, Universidad de Extremadura, 06071 Badajoz, Spain. pmalvare@unex.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Araya", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beltr\u00e1n", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masa", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medina", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Colloid Interface Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0043125", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15721926", "10.1016/j.jcis.2004.09.014", "S0021-9797(04)00910-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
