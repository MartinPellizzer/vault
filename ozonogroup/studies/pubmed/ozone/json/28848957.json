BaP was coated on a Pyrex glass tube and oxidized with different concentrations of ozone. After oxidation, the epoxide products were derivatized by N-acetylcystein (NAC) and then analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results show that in addition to mono-epoxides, diol-epoxides were also formed. BaP exposed to genuine indoor air also produces mono- and diol-epoxides, having similar chromatograms to those produced by oxidation of BaP by low concentrations of ozone. Although it is well recognized that diol-epoxides are formed from BaP oxidation in the human body and that they exhibit carcinogenicity via formation of adducts with DNA, this is the first demonstration that such classes of compounds can be formed by abiotic heterogeneous oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George St., Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada. szhou@chem.utoronto.ca leo.yeung@oru.se."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shouming", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeung", "ForeName": "Leo W Y", "Initials": "LWY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forbes", "ForeName": "Matthew W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mabury", "ForeName": "Scott", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28848957", "10.1039/c7em00181a"]}}]}
