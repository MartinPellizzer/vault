This study assessed air quality inside an urban commuter bus by continuously monitoring PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and CO concentrations during both driving and parking periods. Our findings revealed that the ventilation system of the bus significantly reduced the infiltration of outdoor particulate matter and water vapor. However, CO concentrations were considerably higher inside the bus than outside, primarily due to vehicular self-emission. The ineffection of the ventilation system to remove CO potentially increases long-term exposure risks for passengers. The study identified ozone as a key oxidant in the cabin. Besides vehicle emissions, C3-C10 saturated aldehydes and carbonyl compounds were detected, including acetone, propanal, and hexanal. The presence of 6-MHO, an oxidation product of squalene, suggests that passengers contribute to VOCs load through direct emissions or skin surface reactions. Additionally, human respiration was found to significantly contribute to isoprene levels, estimated at 81.7\u00a0%. This research underscores the need for further investigation into the cumulative effects of stable compounds in cabin air and provides insights for developing healthier public transportation systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
