For example, systems are now in place, which can observe ocean parameters, providing information on algal blooms, pollutants and pathogens as well as storm assessments and sea level rise.", "Space-based systems in place can contribute valuable information through monitoring the processes of long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic, where accumulation in animals and plants can occur. It is well-known that biomagnification up the food chain and ultimate consumption as traditional foods by indigenous peoples have resulted in some of the highest exposures in the world to certain contaminants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maynard", "ForeName": "Nancy G", "Initials": "NG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Conway", "ForeName": "George A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Alaska Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0370457", "ISSNLinking": "0002-4538"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oceans and Seas"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spacecraft"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18062618"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
