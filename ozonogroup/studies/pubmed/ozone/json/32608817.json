During the observation period, a high ozone concentration period (<i>P</i><sub>H</sub>) and a low ozone concentration period (<i>P</i><sub>L</sub>) were defined according to the level of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The average O<sub>3</sub> concentration during <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> was 117 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and that of <i>P</i><sub>L</sub> was 25 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. According to the difference in chemical composition, single particles mainly included aging element carbon particles (EC-aged), secondary particles (Sec), and aging organic carbon particles (OC-aged) during the observation period. The total number of single particles in <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> (348085) was higher than in <i>P</i><sub>L</sub> (224797), and the proportion of Sec particles (37.1%) in <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> was significantly higher than in <i>P</i><sub>L</sub> (27.8%), whereas the proportion of EC-aged particles in <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> (32.1%) was lower than in <i>P</i><sub>L</sub> (44.1%). The proportion of OC-aged particles in <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> (13.5%) was slightly higher than in <i>P</i><sub>L</sub> (10.4%). The concentration of particles containing nitrate and sulfate showed significant diurnal changes during <i>P</i><sub>H</sub>, but no diurnal changes during <i>P</i><sub>L</sub>. The peak area of nitrate and sulfate in the Sec particles and EC-aged particles in <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> was higher than in <i>P</i><sub>L</sub>, which indicates that the amount of nitrate and sulfate produced by the secondary reaction process in <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> was more than in <i>P</i><sub>L</sub>. In addition, the peak areas of nitrate and sulfate in the Sec particles were significantly higher than those in the EC-aged particles, indicating that the age of the Sec particles was greater. In this study, acetate (<sup>59</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and glyoxal (<sup>73</sup>C<sub>2</sub>HO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) were selected to represent the changing characteristics of aldehyde and ketone compounds in single-particle aerosols. The number concentration and peak area of <sup>59</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>73</sup>C<sub>2</sub>HO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in Sec and OC-aged particles in <i>P</i><sub>H</sub> were significantly higher than those in <i>P</i><sub>L</sub>, and showed significant diurnal variation characteristic during <i>P</i><sub>H</sub>. The peak appeared 2 h after the peak of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. In <i>P</i><sub>L</sub>, the peak value was significantly reduced, and the change trend was the same as that of the number concentration of Sec and OC-aged particles, indicating that high concentration of O<sub>3</sub> is beneficial to the oxidation of VOCs to <sup>59</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>73</sup>C<sub>2</sub>HO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. In summary, high concentration of O<sub>3</sub> and enhancement of secondary species in single particles were due to the strong photochemical reactions during <i>P</i><sub>H</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometer and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Online Atmospheric Pollution Source Apportionment, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Meng-Xi", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometer and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Online Atmospheric Pollution Source Apportionment, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Chun-Lei", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometer and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Online Atmospheric Pollution Source Apportionment, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Hexin Analytical Instrument Limited Company, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometer and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Online Atmospheric Pollution Source Apportionment, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Regional Air Quality Monitoring, Guangdong Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Secondary Pollution, Guangdong Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Duo-Hong", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608817", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201910122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
