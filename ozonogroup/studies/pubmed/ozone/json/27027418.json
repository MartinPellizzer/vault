However, a self-produced external screen in the form of nanoparticular Fe(III) minerals could have effectively protected those early microorganisms. In this study, we use viability studies by quantifying colony-forming units (CFUs), as well as Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate reduction rates, to show that encrustation in biogenic and abiogenic Fe(III) minerals can protect a common soil bacteria such as the nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN1 and strain 2AN from harmful UVC radiation. Analysis of DNA damage by quantifying cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) confirmed the protecting effect by Fe(III) minerals. This study suggests that Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms, as would have grown in association with mafic and ultramafic soils/outcrops, would have been able to produce their own UV screen, enabling them to live in terrestrial habitats on early Earth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Geomicrobiology, Center for Applied Geosciences, University of T\u00fcbingen , T\u00fcbingen, Germany ."}], "LastName": "Gauger", "ForeName": "Tina", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta , Edmonton, Canada ."}], "LastName": "Konhauser", "ForeName": "Kurt", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Geomicrobiology, Center for Applied Geosciences, University of T\u00fcbingen , T\u00fcbingen, Germany ."}], "LastName": "Kappler", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Astrobiology", "NlmUniqueID": "101088083", "ISSNLinking": "1557-8070"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27027418", "10.1089/ast.2015.1365"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
