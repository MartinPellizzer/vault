This study is designed to explore the impact of environmental pollution particulate matter PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) on cognitive functions in students from schools located in or away from air-polluted areas.", "In this study, two schools were selected: one was located near a traffic-polluted area (school #1), and the second was in an area away from the traffic-polluted area (school #2). In this study, a total of 300 students were recruited: 150 (75 male and 75 female) students from school #1 located in a traffic-polluted area, and 150 students (75 male and 75 female) from school #2 located away from a traffic polluted area. The overall average age of students was 13.53\u00b11.20 years. The students were selected based on age, gender, health status, height, weight, BMI, ethnicity, and homogenous socio-economic and educational status. The pollutants PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, and SO2 were recorded in the surrounding environment. The overall mean concentration of environmental pollutants in school #1 was 35.00\u00b10.65 and in school #2 was 29.95\u00b10.32. The levels of airborne particles were measured, and the cognitive functions were recorded using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The students performed the cognitive functions tasks, including the attention switching task (AST), choice reaction time (CRT), and motor screening task (MOT).", "The results revealed that the AST-Mean 928.34\u00b1182.23 vs. 483.79\u00b1146.73 (p=0.001), AST-mean congruent 889.12\u00b1197.12 vs. 473.30\u00b1120.11 (p=0.001), AST-mean in-congruent 988.98\u00b1201.27\u00a0 vs. 483.87\u00b1144.57 (p=0.001), CRT-Mean 721.36\u00b1251.72\u00a0 vs. 418.17\u00b189.71 (p=0.001), and MOT-Mean 995.07\u00b1394.37 vs. 526.03\u00b157.83 (p=0.001) were significantly delayed among the students who studied in school located in the traffic polluted area compared to students who studied in school which was located away from the traffic-polluted area.", "Environmental pollution was significantly higher in motor vehicle-congested areas. Cognitive functions were impaired among the students who were studying in a school located in a polluted area. The results further revealed that the students studying in schools located in environmentally polluted areas have attention, thinking, and decision-making abilities related to cognitive function impairment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. smeo@ksu.edu.sa."}], "LastName": "Meo", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salih", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Hussain", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alkhalifah", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meo", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9717360", "ISSNLinking": "1128-3602"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cognition"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38305621", "10.26355/eurrev_202401_35079", "35079"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
