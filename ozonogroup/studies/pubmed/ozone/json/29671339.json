The lowest concentration that completely immobilised all the sperm in 20\u2009s without subsequent recovery of motility was recorded as the minimum effective concentration (MEC). The effects of OOO at MEC on human sperm viability, mitochondrial and acrosomal status, DNA integrity and transmission electron microscopy were observed.", "Our findings demonstrate that OOO dose-dependently inhibits sperm motility. The MEC of OOO for 100% sperm immobilisation in 20\u2009s was 6\u2009\u03bcg/ml. Further experiments showed that sperm ultrastructure, function and DNA integrity were significantly affected after treatment with 6\u2009\u03bcg/ml OOO in vitro.", "OOO has spermicidal potential and may be explored as a promising vaginal contraceptive agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Family Planning Research Institute , Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , P.
