Also, to provide reference information for the prevention and treatment of epistaxis. <b>Methods:</b> Data of patients with epistaxis admitted to the Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University from January 2017 to December 2021 were collected. In addition, the local AQI and the concentrations of 6 air pollutants, namely particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), were analyzed at the time of onset. Furthermore, the correlation with the incidence of epistaxis has been analyzed. <b>Results:</b> From 2017 to 2021, there were 24,721 patients with epistaxis aged from 0 to 17\u2009years old while male patients were more than females. The incidence was higher in April, May, and June. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of daily epistaxis in different months and under AQI conditions (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.05). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between the number of daily epistaxis and the concentrations of AQI, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, PM2.5, PM10, and SO<sub>2</sub> in Yangzhou, in which O<sub>3</sub>, PM10, and SO<sub>2</sub> were highly correlated with the average number of daily epistaxis, and there was no obvious time lag effect of air pollutants on epistaxis. <b>Conclusion:</b> Epistaxis in the Yangzhou area is more common in males, mostly occurs in 0 to 17\u2009years old, with seasonal. There was also a positive correlation between the incidence of epistaxis and air pollutants in Yangzhou. Therefore, by reducing the AQI index in daily life, and reducing the concentration of environmental pollutants in the air, the occurrence of epistaxis could be prevented and reduced to a certain extent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4663-5178"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Pengfei", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ear Nose Throat J", "NlmUniqueID": "7701817", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5613"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38738381", "10.1177/01455613241249540"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
