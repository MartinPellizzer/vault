O<sub>3</sub> exposure increased with W126, a biologically based cumulative exposure index, at a rate of 1.738 ppm-hr yr<sup>-1</sup>. MEGAN3.1 was applied to estimate biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions and their response to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China by quantifying species responses to O<sub>3</sub> stress. In 2020, China's BVOC emissions were 23.26 Tg when considering the effects of O<sub>3</sub> pollution, which was 1.7 % higher than that without O<sub>3</sub> stress. Isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other VOC emissions changed by -1.0 %, 1.4 %, 15.5 %, and 2.7 %, respectively. The stimulated BVOC emissions were mainly focused on the North China Plain (NCP) and a partial area of the Tibetan Plateau, which increased by >45 %. Changes in monthly emissions differed, with the greatest increase, 181 tons (3.25 %), in August. The seasonal patterns for the impacts of O<sub>3</sub> pollution were also distinguished spatially. The elevated O<sub>3</sub> exposure caused BVOC emission increases of 104.7 Gg yr<sup>-1</sup> during 2014-2020, with isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other VOCs contributing -18.6 %, 27.5 %, 40.4 %, and 50.8 %, respectively. The greatest increase in emissions appeared on the NCP and eastern and central China, with annual increases of >100 tons per grid (36 km \u00d7 36 km). The interannual variations in BVOC emissions also displayed different seasonal patterns."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
