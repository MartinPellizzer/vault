The annual exposure to carcinogenic sunlight in Norway, calculated by use of measured ozone levels, showed no increasing trend during the same period. Thus, ozone depletion is not a cause of the increasing trend of the incidence rates of skin cancers. The incidence rates of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) increase with decreasing latitude in Norway. The same is true for CMM in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Our data were used to estimate the implications of a future ozone depletion for the incidence rates of skin cancer: a 10% ozone depletion was found to give rise to a 16-18% increase in the incidence rate of SCC (men and women), a 19% increase in the incidence rate of CMM for men and a 32% increase in the incidence rate of CMM for women. The difference between the numbers for men and women is almost significant and may be related to a different intermittent exposure pattern to sunlight of the two sexes. The increasing trend in the incidence rates of CMM is strongest for the trunk and lower extremities of women, followed by that for the trunk of men. The increasing incidence rates of skin cancers as well as the changing pattern of incidence on different parts of the body is most likely due to changing habits of sun exposure. Comparisons of relative densities of CMM, SCC, LMM and SCC falling per unit area of skin at different parts of the body indicate that sun exposure is the main cause of these cancer forms although other unknown factors may play significant roles as well. For the population as a whole sun exposure during vacations to sunny countries has so far been of minor importance in skin cancer induction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Research, Montebello, Oslo, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dahlback", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "0370635", "ISSNLinking": "0007-0920"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Photochem Photobiol. 1990 Nov;52(5):1025-8", "ArticleIdList": ["2287633"]}, {"Citation": "Photochem Photobiol. 1989 Oct;50(4):497-505", "ArticleIdList": ["2687905"]}, {"Citation": "Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 15;49(18):5207-12", "ArticleIdList": ["2766289"]}, {"Citation": "Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 1;49(15):4247-50", "ArticleIdList": ["2743311"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Epidemiol. 1974 Dec;3(4):325-32", "ArticleIdList": ["4435983"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Epidemiol. 1986 Dec;15(4):502-6", "ArticleIdList": ["3818157"]}, {"Citation": "Med J Aust. 1983 Apr 30;1(9):407-10", "ArticleIdList": ["6835157"]}, {"Citation": "Australas J Dermatol. 1982 Dec;23(3):105-9", "ArticleIdList": ["7183302"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1980 Oct;23(1):24-8", "ArticleIdList": ["7428759"]}, {"Citation": "Med Hypotheses. 1987 Apr;22(4):341-6", "ArticleIdList": ["3647222"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1616864", "PMC1977777", "10.1038/bjc.1992.192"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
