Compared with pure red mud slurry, the red mud (RM)\u00a0+\u00a0sodium ascorbate (SA) slurry significantly improved the denitrification efficiency from 24% to 84% and the desulfurization efficiency to 98%. Meanwhile, the effects of RM, SA concentration, reaction time and O<sub>3</sub>/NO molar ratio on desulfurization and denitrification efficiencies were studied. The results showed that the RM\u00a0+\u00a0SA composite slurry maintained high efficiencies of desulfurization and denitrification for 240\u00a0min under the optimized conditions. As an antioxidant, the introduction of SA inhibited the excessive oxidation of sulfite, and itself could easily react with NO<sub>2</sub> through the redox reaction, greatly promoting the absorption of NO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the reaction mechanism of the simultaneous removal of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> by red mud and sodium ascorbic mixed slurry combined was proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
