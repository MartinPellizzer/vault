Ultraviolet-C and the very heavy ions are therefore produced on earth only artificially, by special lamps and in accelerators. The range of biological effects of the different UV radiations and low and high LET radiations have been studied extensively, yet only recently new facts such as the production of DNA strand breaks by long wave UV light were established, adding to the various points of encounter existing between ionizing and nonionizing radiations. There are some similarities in radiation products, and the resulting effects of insult by radiation on biological systems very often are similar, if not the same. A common phenomenon that exists in all healthy biological cells is the ability to repair damage to DNA and thus either survive or mutate, and although the specific mechanisms of repair are somewhat different, the end result is the same. Recently a mechanism of improved radioprotection was found to involve an effect of certain radioprotective compounds on DNA repair. It is suggested that improved, and nontoxic, modes of protection may be offered by employing such compounds as biological response modifiers and natural substances. Further research is needed and is under way."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nuclear Research Center-Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riklis", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Adv Space Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9878935", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1177"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cosmic Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Repair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Energy Transfer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photobiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiobiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Relative Biological Effectiveness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11539963", "10.1016/0273-1177(94)90479-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
