Many are implicated as ecological signals, but what is the evidence-and how do they work? Volatiles diffuse, are carried by wind, and may be taken up by other organisms or degrade with exposure to atmospheric ozone, radicals, and UV light; visual signals such as color are not subject to these complications (but require a line of sight). Distantly related plants-and nonplants-produce many of the same volatiles, yet specific compounds and blends may be distinct. Here, I present a quantitative review of the literature on plant volatiles as ecological signals, illustrating a field that has focused on developing ideas as much as reporting primary data. I discuss advantages and constraints, review recent advances, and propose considerations for primary studies to elucidate particular functions of plant volatiles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Geography and Chemistry, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; email: meredithchristine.schuman@uzh.ch."}], "LastName": "Schuman", "ForeName": "Meredith C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Annu Rev Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101140127", "ISSNLinking": "1543-5008"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36889007", "10.1146/annurev-arplant-040121-114908"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
