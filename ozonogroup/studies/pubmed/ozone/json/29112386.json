We estimate long-term OPE variability across the eastern United States using two novel approaches: an observation-based empirical method and a chemical transport model (CTM) method. The CTM approach explicitly controls for differing O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>X</sub> reaction product (NO<sub>Z</sub>) deposition rates and separately estimates OPEs from on-road mobile and electricity generating unit sources across a broad spatial scale. We find lower OPEs in urban areas and that average July OPE increased over the eastern United States domain between 2001 and 2011 from 11 to 14. CTM and empirical approaches agree at low NO<sub>Z</sub> concentrations, but CTM OPEs are greater than empirical OPEs at high NO<sub>Z</sub>. Our results support that NO<sub>X</sub> emissions reductions become more effective at reducing O<sub>3</sub> at lower NO<sub>Z</sub> concentrations. Electricity generating unit OPEs are higher than mobile OPEs except near emissions locations, meaning further utility NO<sub>X</sub> emissions reductions will have greater per unit impacts on O<sub>3</sub> regionally."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard University , T.H.
