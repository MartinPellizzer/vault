Then, the degree of oxidation and gel structure of surimi were determined, the in vitro digestion and absorption of the gels were simulated, and the digestion and absorption products were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the quality of surimi gels was improved after proper ozone oxidation. After ozone water rinsing, the dry matter digestibility, peptide, and amino acid content increased, and the changes of all three were in line with the Logistic kinetic model (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.95-0.99). Caco-2 cell absorption experiments showed that the absorption rate of peptides and amino acids decreased after ozone water rinsing. In summary, ozone oxidation can promote the digestion of surimi gels, but it also reduces the absorption of peptides and amino acids by Caco-2 cells. This study provides a reference for the application of ozone in the food field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
