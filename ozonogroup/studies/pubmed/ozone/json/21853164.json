The seedlings, supplied with N (NH(4)NO(3) solution) at 0, 30 and 60 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (simplified as N0, N30, N60, respectively), were exposed to ambient (AA) or elevated O(3) (AA + 60 nmol mol(-1) and AA + 120 nmol mol(-1), designated as AA + 60 and AA + 120, respectively) for the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons. Symptomatic leaf percentages were significantly increased with O(3) concentration. AA + 120 significantly decreased the mean leaf size and chlorophyll content of both 2009- and 2010-emerged leaves, inhibited the growth of stem height and basal diameter, and reduced biomass accumulation of all plant parts except for leaves. By comparison, only the chlorophyll content of 2009-emerged leaves and root dry weight were significantly reduced under AA + 60. Specific leaf area, total leaf area and foliar biomass were not affected even at a higher O(3) level. On the other hand, N loads, especially N60, exerted significantly positive effects on all variables except mean leaf size and shoot/root ratio. No significant interactions between O(3) and N were detected, suggesting that the N supply at \u226460 kg ha(-1) year(-1) did not significantly modify the response of C. camphora to O(3) in terms of seedling growth and biomass accumulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2871 mailbox, Shuangqing Road 18, Haidian District, Beijing, 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Junfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhaozhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaoke", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum camphora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21853164", "10.1039/c1em10305a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
