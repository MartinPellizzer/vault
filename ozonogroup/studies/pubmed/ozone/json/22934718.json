No clear pattern was observed for I(2) or aerosol parameters as a function of light levels. Aerosol mass fluxes and particle number concentrations, were, however, correlated with I(2) mixing ratios for low O(3) mixing ratios of <3 ppb(v) (R(2) = 0.7 and 0.83, respectively for low light levels, and R(2) = 0.95 and 0.98, respectively for medium light levels). Additional experiments into particle production as a function of laboratory-generated I(2), over a mixing ratio range of 1-8 ppb(v), were conducted under moderate O(3) mixing ratios (\u223c24 ppb(v)) where a clear, 100-fold or greater, increase in the aerosol number concentrations and mass fluxes was observed compared to the low O(3) experiments. A linear relationship between particle concentration and I(2) was found, in reasonable agreement with previous studies. Scaling the laboratory relationship to aerosol concentrations typical of the coastal boundary layer suggests a I(2) mixing ratio range of 6-93 ppt(v) can account for the observed particle production events. Aerosol number concentration produced from I(2) is more than a factor of 10 higher than that produced from CH(2)I(2) for the same mixing ratios."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Physics and Centre for Climate & Air Pollution Studies, Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, University Road, Galway, Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monahan", "ForeName": "Ciaran", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashu-Ayem", "ForeName": "Enowmbi R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nitschke", "ForeName": "Udo", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Darby", "ForeName": "Steven B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Paul D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stengel", "ForeName": "Dagmar B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venables", "ForeName": "Dean S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Dowd", "ForeName": "Colin D", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kelp"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Laminaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Marine Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22934718", "10.1021/es3011805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
