Recently, several studies have been conducted that primarily aimed to enhance the overall performance of desiccant air conditioners by innovating new desiccant materials, innovating new system configurations and improving system designs and controls, and integrating different hybrid energy sub-systems technologies. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the studies mentioned earlier. The present comprehensive review dealt with several axes: first, an overview of the importance of using desiccant air conditioners and their operations, and performance indicators. Second, a summary statement for desiccant materials that includes: the new innovative desiccant materials and the most important composite desiccant materials. Third, detailed information on the newest innovative designs and configurations of desiccant air conditioning systems and their control systems. Fourth, a detailed statement on the most important hybrid energy sub-systems technologies integrated with desiccant air conditioners. Based on the latest developments in desiccant air conditioning systems, this study presents discussions of urgent issues and recommendations for future work that can help focus necessary efforts to find solutions to critical and pending problems, which lead to further improvements in the overall performance of desiccant air conditioners."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
