Although stringent anthropogenic NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission controls have been implemented since the early 2000s in the United States, several rural regions of California still suffer from O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Previous findings suggest that soils are a dominant source of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions in California; however, a statewide assessment of the impacts of soil NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission (SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) on air quality is still lacking. Here we quantified the contribution of SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub> to the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> budget and the effects of SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub> on surface O<sub>3</sub> in California during summer by using WRF-Chem with an updated SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub> scheme, the Berkeley Dalhousie Iowa Soil NO Parameterization (BDISNP). The model with BDISNP shows a better agreement with TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> columns, giving confidence in the SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub> estimates. We estimate that 40.1% of the state's total NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions in July 2018 are from soils, and SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub> could exceed anthropogenic sources over croplands, which accounts for 50.7% of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions. Such considerable amounts of SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub> enhance the monthly mean NO<sub>2</sub> columns by 34.7% (53.3%) and surface NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by 176.5% (114.0%), leading to an additional 23.0% (23.2%) of surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration in California (cropland). Our results highlight the cobenefits of limiting SNO<sub><i>x</i></sub> to help improve air quality and human health in rural California."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
