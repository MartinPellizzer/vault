The catalytic membrane coupled with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) not only significantly enhances the pollutant removal efficiency but also inhibits the fouling of the membrane via self-cleaning. In this review, the preparation approaches of catalytic membranes including blending, surface coating, and bottom-up synthesis are comprehensively summarized. The different integrated catalytic membrane systems coupled with photocatalysis, Fenton oxidation, persulfate activations, ozonation and electrocatalytic oxidation are discussed in terms of mechanisms and performance. Besides, the principles, influencing factors, advantages and issues of the different catalytic membrane/oxidation systems are outlined comparatively. Finally, the future challenges, and research directions are suggested, which is conducive to the design and development of catalytic membrane-oxidation systems for practical remediation of organic containing wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
