A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 3000 citizens in Kitaibaraki City, Japan. The questionnaire included social participation status in January 2020 and January 2021, the Kihon Checklist, working status, and economic status. We classified the respondents into the following groups: Nonparticipating, no participation at either time point; Discontinued, participation only in 2020; and Continued, participation at both time points. We compared the Discontinued and Continued groups in terms of Kihon Checklist items using the <i>t</i>-test.", "Of 2963 individuals who received the questionnaire, 1307 (44.1%) returned it, and 1047 were analyzed. Of the respondents analyzed, 586 (56.0%) were in the Nonparticipating group, 254 (24.3%) were in the Discontinued group, and 207 (19.8%) were in the Continued group. On the Kihon Checklist, oral function and mood differed significantly between the Discontinued and Continued groups. The proportion of those with impairment in multiple categories of the Kihon Checklist was 12.3% in the Nonparticipating group, 5.5% in the Discontinued group, and 3.4% in the Continued group.", "Older individuals who continued participating in social activities at 1\u00a0year into the COVID-19 pandemic might have a lower risk of frailty in terms of oral function and depressed mood."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Authors.
