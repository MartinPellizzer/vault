For enhancing VOCs emission policy, we investigated potential formation of O<sub>3</sub> and SOA based on analyses of node-specific VOCs concentration and species distribution in solvent-consuming industry. Although aromatics were found to contribute most to O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation averagely (2.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.14\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/g VOCs, 1.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.67\u00a0g SOA/g VOCs), however, large disparity concerning emission and secondary pollution profile were identified among different emission nodes which demonstrated that regulation policy should be formulated based on comprehensive pollution characteristic. Therefore, emission nodes were classified into four clusters through data normalization, formatting and classification process, including aromatics dominated (7 emission nodes), aromatics-alkene dominated (4 emission nodes), aromatics-alcohols dominated (4 emission nodes) and alcohols dominated (4 emission nodes). And different dominating VOCs species were further obtained in each cluster. Subsequently, focusing regulation measures of reducing O<sub>3</sub> and SOA for different emission source clusters were proposed to guide pollution prevention and enhance future VOCs emission policies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
