To understand the causes of high ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, the high O<sub>3</sub> episode days associated with special synoptic systems in the three bays were identified via observations and simulated by the weather research and forecasting coupled with community multiscale air quality (WRF-CMAQ) model. It was revealed that the interaction between synoptic winds and mesoscale breezes resulted in slow wind speeds over the HZB and PRE, where air pollutants transported from upwind cities gained a long residence time and subsequently participated in intensive photochemical reactions. The net O<sub>3</sub> production rates within the bay areas were even comparable to those in surrounding cities. This finding was also applicable to BHB but with lower net O<sub>3</sub> production rates, while high levels of background O<sub>3</sub> and the regional transport from farther upwind BHB partially elevated the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Hence, these three bay areas served as O<sub>3</sub> \"pools\" which caused the accumulation of air pollutants via atmospheric dynamics and subsequent intense photochemical reactions under certain meteorological conditions. The results may be applicable to other similar ecotones around the world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Land and Space, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Zeren", "ForeName": "Yangzong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Land and Space, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Beining", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science and Technology, International Institute for Earth System Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yanhua", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science and Technology, International Institute for Earth System Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3306-1008"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Land and Space, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Xiaopu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7329-2110"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Likun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0655-3389"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hongli", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Land and Space, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xufei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7996-7294"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Land and Space, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36178303", "10.1021/acs.est.2c05126"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
