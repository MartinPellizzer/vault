However, the biochemical mechanisms by which ROS and NO participate, and the potential interaction between these molecules are still unclear. Ozone (O(3)) can be used as a tool to elicit ROS-activated stress responses and to activate cell death in plant leaves. We have recently shown that O(3) induced a rapid accumulation of NO in Arabidopsis leaves and at late time points NO production coincided with the formation of hypersensitive response like lesions. Experiments using O(3) and the NO-donor SNP alone or in combination indicated that both molecules are capable of activating a large set of stress related genes. In combined treatment, NO attenuated O(3)-induction of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthetic and signaling genes, and reduced SA accumulation. In addition, NO can elevate the levels of ethylene in several mutants. Thus, NO is a modifier of ROS signaling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biology, Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahlfors", "ForeName": "Reetta", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brosch\u00e9", "ForeName": "Mikael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kangasj\u00e4rvi", "ForeName": "Jaakko", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Signal Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "101291431", "ISSNLinking": "1559-2316"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Ahlfors R, Brosch\u00e9 M, Kollist H, Kangasj\u00e4rvi J.
