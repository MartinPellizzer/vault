The GC conditions were initially optimized for complete separations of several pptv-level VOCs (e.g. vinyl chloride, 1,3-butadiene, acrylonitrile, 1,2-dichloroethane and chloroform) in ambient air because the selected ions are easily interfered with by coexisting C4-, C5-hydrocarbons and analytes presented at ppbv levels. Thirty-four VOCs determined by the 1 week and 24 h sampling method in December 16-22 (2002) had concentrations of 6.0-15000 pptv per compound. Concentrations of 28 VOCs (including polar VOCs (e.g. methyl isobutyl ketone and butyl acetate)) obtained by the method were approximately equal to the mean values calculated from 24 h sampling (< +/- 10% deviation). Six VOCs that had low concentrations of 6.0-43 pptv showed more than +/- 10% deviation. Thirteen VOCs were not detected during the entire sampling period. The effect of relative humidity or ozone for the specific VOCs (e.g. MIBK, butyl acetate, vinyl chloride, 1,3-butadiene and styrene) was negligible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nishikawa Keisoku Co.
