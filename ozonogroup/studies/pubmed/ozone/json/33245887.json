Convincing associations between TRAP and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are known, but the underlying biological mechanisms are not well established. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) is a promising platform for untargeted characterization of molecular mechanisms between TRAP and health indexes.", "We examined metabolic perturbations associated with short-term exposures to TRAP, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) among 180 participants of the Center for Health Discovery and Well-Being (CHDWB), a cohort of Emory University-affiliated employees.", "A cross-sectional study was conducted on baseline visits of 180 CHDWB participants enrolled during 2008-2012, in whom HRM profiling was determined in plasma samples using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry with positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes. Ambient pollution concentrations were measured at an ambient monitor near downtown Atlanta. Metabolic perturbations associated with TRAP exposures were assessed following an untargeted metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) framework using feature-specific Tobit regression models, followed by enriched pathway analysis and chemical annotation.", "Subjects were predominantly white (76.1%) and non-smokers (95.6%), and all had at least a high school education. In total, 7821 and 4123 metabolic features were extracted from the plasma samples by the negative and positive ESI runs, respectively. There are 3421 features significantly associated with at least one air pollutant by negative ion mode, and 1691 features by positive ion mode. Biological pathways enriched by features associated with the pollutants are primarily involved in nucleic acids damage/repair (e.g., pyrimidine metabolism), nutrient metabolism (e.g., fatty acid metabolism), and acute inflammation (e.g., histidine metabolism and tyrosine metabolism). NO<sub>2</sub> and EC were associated most consistently with these pathways. We confirmed the chemical identity of 8 metabolic features in negative ESI and 2 features in positive ESI, including metabolites closely linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, such as histamine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and proline.", "We identified a range of ambient pollutants, including components of TRAP, associated with differences in the metabolic phenotype among the cohort of 180 subjects. We found Tobit models to be a robust approach to handle missing data among the metabolic features. The results were encouraging of further use of HRM and MWAS approaches for characterizing molecular mechanisms underlying exposure to TRAP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
