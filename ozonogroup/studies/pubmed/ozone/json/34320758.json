The process parameters such as pH (3.0-11) and ozone dosage (5-25\u00a0mg/L) were optimized and obtained as 3.0 and 25\u00a0mg/L, respectively to treat the AO 7 by ozonation. Similarly, the process parameters, namely pH (5.0-9.0) and temperature (25-45\u00a0\u00b0C) were optimized and found to be 7.0 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively by biological treatment. Bacillus sp. was found to be the most effective bacteria to remove the AO 7. An integrated system obtained an overall 98.7% removal of AO 7 under optimum conditions. Andrews-Haldane model was best to predict the experimental data and the bio-kinetic constants; \u00b5<sub>max</sub>: 0.1875\u00a0day<sup>-1</sup>; K<sub>s</sub>: 49.53\u00a0mg/L; K<sub>i</sub>: 133.32\u00a0mg/L were obtained. The developed integrated system can be a promising option for the treatment of azo dye containing-wastewaters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
