Black peppers were exposed to three different ozone concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm) for different periods (0 to 360 min) at 85% +/- 3% relative humidity (RH) and 25 +/- 0.5 degree C. An approximately 7-log CFU/g reduction of E. coli in whole black peppers was achieved by treating the samples with 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm of ozone for 360, 240, or 120 min, respectively. E. coli populations in ground black peppers were reduced from an initial count of about 7.5 log CFU/g to 1 log CFU/g after 360 min at 0.1- and 0.5-ppm ozone concentrations, whereas the same microbial reduction was obtained after 240 min at 1.0-ppm ozone concentration. An ozone concentration of 0.1 ppm for 360 min was found to be appropriate to inactivate E. coli in whole and ground black peppers without alteration of the organoleptic properties. No significant differences (P > or = 0.05) were present in the bitterness, flavor, odor, color, or overall acceptability values of the whole and ground black peppers treated with 0.1 ppm of ozone for up to 360 min."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Gebze Institute of Technology, P.O.
