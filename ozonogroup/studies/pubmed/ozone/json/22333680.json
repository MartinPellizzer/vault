However, substantial negative interference caused by the presence of ozone in air has been reported. To avoid the influences of ozone, a potassium iodide scrubber (KI-scrubber) is commonly used. However, when air sampling using a DNPH-cartridge and a KI-scrubber is performed under conditions of high humidity, moist potassium iodide in the KI-scrubber traps carbonyls before they reach the DNPH-cartridge. Moreover, wet KI reacts with I(2) to form KI(3) and this oxidative reagent moves to the DNPH-cartridge and destroys the DNPH and DNPhydrazone derivatives. In order to alleviate these problems, new ozone scrubbers (BPE-scrubber, HQ-scrubber) have been developed. BPE-scrubber and HQ-scrubber consist of silica gel particles impregnated with trans-1,2-bis-(2-pyridyl) ethylene (BPE) and hydroquinone (HQ), respectively. BPE reacts with ozone to form pyridine aldehyde and HQ reacts with ozone to form benzoquinone. The amounts of reducing agent in silica gel (130 mg) for ozone scrubber are 1% (w/w) for BPE-cartridge; 0.2% (w/w) for HQ-scrubber. These scrubbers can be used in air containing 140 \u03bcg/m(3) of ozone for 24h at a flow rate of 200 mL/min. When the relative humidity exceeded 80%, KI in the KI-scrubber was gradually moistened and changed to yellow in color. Peak abundance of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone DNPhydrazones was diminished to 25%, 15%, and 2%, respectively, compared with the BPE-scrubber or HQ-scrubber. When using a BPE-scrubber or HQ-scrubber, decomposition of DNPH and DNPhydrazones was not observed at a wide range of relative humidities (3-97%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.
