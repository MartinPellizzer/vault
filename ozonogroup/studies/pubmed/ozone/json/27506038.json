The result demonstrated that within the range of 1-5 mg \u00b7 L\u207b\u00b9 O\u2083, the formation of AOC increased with increasing ozone dosage, but higher ozone dosage (9 mg \u00b7 L\u207b\u00b9) resulted in reduction of AOC formation. AOC formation increased with higher pH but decreased with increasing ionic strength. The result also showed that AOC formation with hydrophobic fraction (HPO) was the most, followed by transphilic fraction (TPI), and charged hydrophilic fraction (CHPI), while neutral hydrophilic fraction (NHPI) was the least. It was found that AOC formation related closely with SUVA of small molecular weight organics, and the lower SUVA produced more AOC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Bing-zhi", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jia-li", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chang", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27506038"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
