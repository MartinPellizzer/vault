This paper discusses the parameters that impact the UV light (UV) and ozone disinfection processes and the related mechanisms based on literature review. Low-pressure UV and ozone technologies were investigated on effluents that covered a wide range of water quality. The results are given in terms of design doses required to meet three major disinfection standards. Both processes were found eligible for the majority of effluents tested. Although cost-effectiveness is usually considered more favourable to UV, the ozone alternative should be examined in cases such as the disinfection of low-quality effluents or large treatment plants. Ozonation was also found capable of meeting the stringent Title 22 standard with no coagulation at a dose of 10 mg/l."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIRSEE-Lyonnaise des Eaux, 38 rue du Pr\u00e9sident Wilson, 78230 Le Pecq, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savoye", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janex", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lazarova", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11436776"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
