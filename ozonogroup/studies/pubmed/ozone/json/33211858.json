Investigation into IMD would provide insights on the actual health burden of air pollution and interpretation of associations. We aimed to investigate IMD regarding short-term effect of air pollution on mortality.", "We illustrated manifestations and interpretations of lag-mortality associations. If IMD exists, a net increase of one cause-specific death can be offset by a net decrease of other cause-specific deaths. We conducted a time-series analysis to estimate associations of ambient particulate matter smaller than 10\u2009\u00b5m (PM10), ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) with mortality, considering lags up to the previous 45\u2009days, for seven major cities of South Korea from 2006 to 2013. Attributable mortality cases were identified.", "For O3, respiratory mortality [11\u00a0929 cases, 95% empirical confidence interval (eCI), 5358, 17\u00a0688 cases] was counterbalanced by cardiovascular mortality (-11\u00a0272 cases, 95% eCI: -22\u00a0444, -629 cases). All-cause mortality was 37\u00a0148 cases (95% eCI: 4448, 68\u00a0782 cases). For PM10, respiratory deaths were 9167 cases (95% eCI: 563, 16\u00a0521 cases), and cardiovascular deaths were 6929 cases (95% eCI: -11\u00a0793, 24\u00a0138 cases). Estimates for SO2 were comparable to those for PM10. All-cause mortality attributable to NO2 was explained by short-term mortality displacement. No associations with mortality were found for CO.", "IMD may exist in the relationship between air pollution and mortality.
