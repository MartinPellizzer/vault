Additionally\uff0c the backward trajectory clustering analysis method\uff0c potential source contribution method \uff08PSCF\uff09\uff0c and concentration weight trajectory analysis method \uff08CWT\uff09 were used to study the transport paths and potential source region distribution of the DHP of Nanjing by different synoptic situations. The synoptic situations favorable to the DHP in Nanjing were the control of weak low-pressure type \uff08Type1\uff09 and high-pressure center \uff08Type2\uff09. Synoptic situations could have had an effect on the directional origin of the backward trajectory. In Type1\uff0c the Nanjing area was affected by two low pressures in the northeast and southwest\uff0c and the clustering trajectories of the Nanjing air mass mainly came from the eastern and western directions. The average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the trajectory were 83.48 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 106.85 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>\uff0c respectively. In Type 2\uff0c Nanjing and its surroundings were at the edge of the high-pressure center\uff0c and the air mass cluster trajectories mainly came from the north and east. The average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the trajectory were 94.47 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 92.32 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>\uff0c respectively. Most of the two types of backward trajectories belonged to short and medium-distance regional transportation\uff0c indicating that the pollution of neighboring provinces was one of the main factors affecting the DHP in Nanjing. PSCF and CWT analysis showed that the distribution of the most important potential sources of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in Type1 and Type2 were not completely consistent\uff0c which indicates that the two pollutants did not come from the same area in the DHP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory of Agrometeorological Support and Applied Technique, China Meteorological Administration, Zhengzhou 450003, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Meteorological Observatory, Zhengzhou 450003, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of High Technology for Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of High Technology for Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory of Agrometeorological Support and Applied Technique, China Meteorological Administration, Zhengzhou 450003, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Meteorological Observatory, Zhengzhou 450003, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anyang National Climate Observatory, Anyang 455000, China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Hai-Jiang", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471903", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202302177"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
