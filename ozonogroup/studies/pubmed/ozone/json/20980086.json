Such understanding is needed as up to 50% of forests, globally, may be subjected to phytotoxic concentrations of ozone. The physiological, transcriptional and genetic response to ozone was examined in Populus trichocarpa and P. deltoides, which show extreme sensitivity and tolerance to ozone, respectively. Using an inbred F2 mapping population derived from these two species, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits associated with ozone response, examined segregation of the transcriptional response to ozone and co-located genes showing divergent responses between tolerant and sensitive genotypes with QTL. QTL were identified linking detrimental effects of ozone with leaf and biomass traits and differential responses were found for key genes involved in ethylene production and response."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010.
