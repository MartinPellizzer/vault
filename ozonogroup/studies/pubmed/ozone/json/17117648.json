The results indicate that mycorrhizal colonization was slightly affected by elevated atmospheric O3, but spore and hypahe growth were significantly impacted. Spore number at high O3 level increased I times than that at ambient O3; hypahe length of AM at low and high O3 level decreased 48.7% and 85.6% than that at ambient O3, respectively. Root biomass, nodule number, horsebean pod and grain weight (excluding the treatment-- S + M) significantly decreased with elevated atmospheric O3, but they markedly increased after inoculation with AM fungi. Compared with the uninoculated treatment, nodule number increased by 2-5 times and grain weight of horsebean increased by 3-6 times after inoculation with AM fungi. Relative function of AM was slightly impacted by elevated atmospheric O3. Although indigenous microbes competed with inoculated AM fungi, inoculation with AM fungi could decrease the stress of O3 on plant, which was positive significant to alleviate crop loss resulted from O3 pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China. shgwang2002@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-guang", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-ke", "Initials": "XK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zong-wei", "Initials": "ZW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Hyphae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Spores, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vicia faba"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17117648"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
