The new methodology enables fast computation of the ionization energies and evaluation of the respective Dyson orbitals, the square norms of which are related with the ionization probabilities, in the ground and excited electronic states of molecules. As the application of EKT recycles the intermediate quantities from the SSR analytical energy gradient, evaluation of the ionization energies and probabilities can be carried out on-the-fly during the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. This opens up a perspective for fast theoretical simulation of the time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy observations. In the present work, the new methodology is tested in the computation of the ionization energies and Dyson orbitals of several molecules in the ground and excited electronic states, including strongly correlated species, such as the ozone molecule, dissociating chemical bonds, and conical intersections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1541-739X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Filatov", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seunghoon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8757-1396"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Cheol Ho", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Theory Comput", "NlmUniqueID": "101232704", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9618"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32421323", "10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00218"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
