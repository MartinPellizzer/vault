The mechanisms and response characteristics of N<sub>2</sub>O emission in desert soils to precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition are still unclear. To further elucidate this, an in-situ experiment was conducted in the Gurbantunggut Desert, a temperate desert in China, between June and September 2015 and 2016. The response in N<sub>2</sub>O flux to water addition (equivalent to 5\u00a0mm precipitation) was very transient in summer, only lasting one to two days. This was attributed to the rapid decrease in soil moisture following the water addition, due to the high temperature and drought conditions, and there was no significant change in N<sub>2</sub>O emission or in the abundance of N-related key functional genes. In contrast, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions increased significantly in response to N addition. This was associated with an increase in functional gene abundances of amoA (ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB)) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which responded positively to increasing soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N content, but were inhibited by increasing soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N content. The abundance of the nirS (nitrate reductase) gene was significantly increased by increasing soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N content. Interestingly, the indirect effect of increased soil moisture in enhancing N<sub>2</sub>O emission by increasing the abundance of AOA was offset by a direct effect of soil moisture in inhibiting soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission. Overall, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were mainly controlled by AOA rather than AOB in summer, and were more sensitive to soil available N than to soil moisture in this temperate desert."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
