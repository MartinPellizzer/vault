It was confirmed that light significantly enhanced the uptake of O<sub>3</sub> on HA. The initial uptake coefficient (\u03b3<sub>i</sub>) and the steady-state uptake coefficient (\u03b3<sub>ss</sub>) of O<sub>3</sub> under irradiation increased by 1.6 and 3.8 times compared to those in the dark, respectively. The \u03b3<sub>i</sub> and \u03b3<sub>ss</sub> on HA varied in the range of 0.76-2.77\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup> and 1.50-9.55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-</sup><sup>6</sup>, respectively, which were dependent on various environmental factors including HA mass, total irradiance, initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration, O<sub>2</sub> content, temperature, relative humidity (RH) and HA solution pH. Both \u03b3<sub>i</sub> and \u03b3<sub>ss</sub> showed linear dependence on the total irradiance (0-2.07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>16</sup> photons/(cm<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s)) of the light source, and increased with the HA mass (0-3.2\u00a0\u03bcg/cm<sup>2</sup>), temperature (278-298\u00a0K) and HA solution pH (4.0-9.6). However, they showed negative correlations with the initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration and O<sub>2</sub> content. The \u03b3<sub>i</sub> remained constant in the RH range of 7%-60%, while \u03b3<sub>ss</sub> exhibited the maximum value at RH\u00a0=\u00a020%. During the ozonization of HA under irradiation, some functional groups were consumed, including CH<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>, aromatic CC, OH, CO, COOH and COO<sup>-</sup>. HA aged by O<sub>3</sub> exhibited a decrease in the mass absorption efficiency (MAE) and a small increase in the absorption \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent between 300 and 600\u00a0nm wavelength (AAE<sub>300,600</sub>), which was ascribed to changes in the composition of HA during the photochemical ozonization process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
