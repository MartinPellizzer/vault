Current knowledge on source characteristics of aromatics in the urban region of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the \"Third Pole\" and ecologically sensitive area, remains limited. In this study, an intensive observation of 17 aromatic hydrocarbons was conducted in Lhasa, the cultural and economic center of TP, during the second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research in summer 2020. The results showed that the average concentration of aromatics in Lhasa (7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 ppbv) was unexpectedly higher than those in megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Tripled concentrations and corresponding ozone formation potential during pollution episodes were recorded. Further source apportionment using positive matrix factorization revealed that solvent usage (60.0\u00a0%) was the dominant source, which may be due to the extremely low atmospheric pressure. Vehicle exhaust (15.4\u00a0%), industrial emissions (12.8\u00a0%), fuel evaporation (6.2\u00a0%), and burning emissions (5.7\u00a0%) were also important sources. The concentration weighted trajectory analysis revealed that the observed high levels of aromatics were mainly driven by local anthropogenic emissions, rather than the regional transport by the Indian summer monsoon. Long-term exposure to aromatics in Lhasa was assessed to pose carcinogenic risks to the population, with the risks of benzene and ethylbenzene 5 times the criteria. Our results suggest that, given the magnified emissions of aromatics in this extreme environment (low atmospheric pressure and strong solar radiation), the implementation of targeted pollution controls is urgently needed to mitigate the aromatic-related photochemical pollution and health threats in TP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
