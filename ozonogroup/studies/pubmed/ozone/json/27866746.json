In this study, we exposed peatland mesocosms from a temperate wet heath dominated by the sedge Schoenus nigricans and Sphagnum papillosum to four O<sub>3</sub> treatments in open-top chambers for 2.5years, to investigate the O<sub>3</sub> impacts on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and the processes that underpin these responses. Summer CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, were significantly reduced, by 27% over the experiment, due to summer daytime (8hday<sup>-1</sup>) O<sub>3</sub> exposure to non-filtered air (NFA) plus 35ppb O<sub>3</sub>, but were not significantly affected by year-round, 24hday<sup>-1</sup>, exposure to NFA plus 10ppb or NFA plus 25ppb O<sub>3</sub>. There was no evidence that the reduced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in response to elevated summer O<sub>3</sub> exposure were caused by reduced plant-derived carbon availability below-ground, because we found no significant effect of high summer O<sub>3</sub> exposure on root biomass, pore water dissolved organic carbon concentrations or the contribution of recent photosynthate to CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. Our CH<sub>4</sub> production potential and CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation potential measurements in the different O<sub>3</sub> treatments could also not explain the observed CH<sub>4</sub> emission responses to O<sub>3</sub>. However, pore water ammonium concentrations at 20cm depth were consistently reduced during the experiment by elevated summer O<sub>3</sub> exposure, and strong positive correlations were observed between CH<sub>4</sub> emission and pore water ammonium concentration at three peat depths over the 2.5-year study. Our results therefore imply that elevated regional O<sub>3</sub> exposures in summer, but not the small increases in northern hemisphere annual mean background O<sub>3</sub> concentrations predicted over this century, may lead to reduced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from temperate peatlands as a consequence of reductions in soil inorganic nitrogen affecting methanogenic and/or methanotrophic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
