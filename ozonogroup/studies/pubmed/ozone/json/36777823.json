Among them, 62 patients received arthroscopic irrigation alone were assigned into a control group, and the remaining 70 patients who received arthroscopic irrigation combined with ozone injection were assigned into an observation group. Therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions during the treatment were compared in the two groups. Bone metabolism, inflammatory factor levels and joint function of patients before and after treatment were observed; patients were further divided into a good prognosis group and a poor prognosis group regarding their prognosis. Multivariate analysis was performed to explore the independent risk factors affecting prognosis.", "After treatment, compared to the control group, the total effective rate of the observation group was higher (P<0.05), and there was no notable difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). The bone metabolism indexes, osteocalcin (OC) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in the observation group were also significantly higher (P<0.05), while the level of nuclear transcription factor \u03baB receptor activator ligand (RANKL) in the observation group was markedly lower. The inflammation level in the observation group was lower (P<0.05). Lysholm score in the observation group was strikingly higher (P<0.05), while its Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) score and visual analogue scale (VAS) were lower (P<0.05). The observation group had a lower rate of poor prognosis (P<0.05). Age (OR: 1.786, 95% CI: 1.347-2.370), disease duration (OR: 1.132, 95% CI: 1.002-1.279), VAS after treatment (OR: 2.316, 95% CI: 1.089-4.925), and post-treatment IL-6 (OR: 1.186, 95% CI: 1.017-1.382) were all independent risk factors for poor prognosis.", "Joint irrigation combined with ozone injection shows good efficacy in the treatment of KOA, and could effectively relieve the clinical symptoms of patients, improve their bone metabolism indexes, and help the recovery of knee joint function."], "CopyrightInformation": "AJTR Copyright \u00a9 2023."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Third Department of Orthopaedics, No. 215 Hospital of Shaanxi Nuclear Industry Xianyang 712000, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yongpeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Third Department of Orthopaedics, No. 215 Hospital of Shaanxi Nuclear Industry Xianyang 712000, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Xingyuan Hospital Yulin 719000, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Weiqin", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Xingyuan Hospital Yulin 719000, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhiquan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Xingyuan Hospital Yulin 719000, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Maheng", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Transl Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101493030", "ISSNLinking": "1943-8141"}, "CoiStatement": "None."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Cui A, Li H, Wang D, Zhong J, Chen Y, Lu H.
