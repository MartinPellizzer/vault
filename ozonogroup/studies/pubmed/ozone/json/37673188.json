In the recent decades, the ageing of the population and the increase of ozone pollution have accelerated. However, epidemiological associations between long-term ozone exposure and renal function in susceptible populations are understudied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of 1\u00a0y ozone exposure with renal function among the older adults in Xiamen City, China. We recruited 6024 eligible participants with a median age of 65.00 years, estimated their ozone exposure data, and collected questionnaires on demographic status and lifestyle factors as well as information on healthcare access. A generalized linear model was used to assess the association. An increase of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> of 1\u00a0y ozone exposure was negatively associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [-3.12 (95% CI: -4.76, -1.48)]. The associations were stronger in men, non-smokers, and those with hypertension or T2DM. Clinical indicators of high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and total cholesterol were the main mediators to regulate the ozone-renal function association. Our results suggested that long-term ozone exposure is a potential risk factor for renal function in Chinese middle-aged and elderly adults."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
