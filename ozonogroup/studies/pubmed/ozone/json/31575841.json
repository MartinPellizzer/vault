The health condition of the patients was evaluated before and after treatment, through the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Blood samples were obtained from all patients by venous puncture for biochemical routine analysis and serotonin levels in serum and the following peripheral blood mononuclear cells (BMCs) were isolated for oxidative stress quantification: reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and lipid peroxidation (LP) and protein carbonyl (PC) content, as these are signs of oxidative cell damage.", "All patients treated with ozone reported an improvement in sleep and mental alertness, a marked decrease of asthenia accompanied by a decrease of FIQ as well as tender points, and a moderate increase of serotonin levels. Also, an important decrease of LP and PC was observed; ROS also decreased, although less obvious, which indicates a reduction in oxidative stress levels.", "The autohemotherapy with ozone in patients with FM showed an important decline of tender points and FIQ score, as well as a decrease of oxidative stress levels. This treatment allows patients to face life with greater vitality and less drug use, diminishing harmful side effects. Further investigation should be carried out, including groups with more patients and clinical trials, to elucidate the effect of ozone therapy in patients suffering from FM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Sevilla."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreno-Fern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Sevilla."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mac\u00edas-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Sevilla."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valverde-Moreno", "ForeName": "Roc\u00edo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Sevilla."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ortiz", "ForeName": "Tamara", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Sevilla."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Infanta Luisa, Sevilla, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Molin\u00ed-Estrada", "ForeName": "Angel", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Sevilla."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De-Miguel", "ForeName": "Manuel", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Autohemotherapy with ozone as a possible effective treatment for Fibromyalgia."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Portugal", "MedlineTA": "Acta Reumatol Port", "NlmUniqueID": "0431702", "ISSNLinking": "0303-464X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Transfusion, Autologous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnostic Self Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fibromyalgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sickness Impact Profile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31575841", "190059"]}}]}
