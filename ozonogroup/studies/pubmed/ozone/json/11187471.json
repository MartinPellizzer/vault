Addition of excess NaN3 prior to addition of KPF6 yields the azide derivative [(cyclam-acetato)FeN3]PF6 (2a) as orange microcrystals. The X-ray crystal structure of the azide derivative has been determined as the tetraphenylborate salt (2b). Reaction of 1 with silver triflate yields [(cyclam-acetato)Fe(O3SCF3)]PF6 (3), which partially dissociates triflate in nondried solvents to yield a mixture of triflate and aqua bound species. Each of the iron(III) derivatives is low-spin (d5, S = 1/2) as determined by variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements, M\u00f6ssbauer and EPR spectroscopy. The low-spin iron(II) (d6, S = 0) complexes 1red and 2ared have been prepared by electrochemical and chemical methods and have been characterized by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. Photolysis of 2a at 419 nm in frozen acetonitrile yields a nearly colorless species in approximately 80% conversion with an isomer shift delta = -0.04 mm/s and a quadrupole splitting delta EQ = -1.67 mm/s. A spin-Hamiltonian analysis of the magnetic M\u00f6ssbauer spectra is consistent with an FeV ion (d3, S = 3/2). The proposed [(cyclam-acetato)FeV=N]+ results from the photooxidation of 2a via heterolytic N-N cleavage of coordinated azide. Photolysis of 2a in acetonitrile solution at -35 degrees C (300 nm) or 20 degrees C (Hg immersion lamp) results primarily in photoreduction via homolytic Fe-Nazide cleavage yielding FeII (d,6 S = 0) with an isomer shift delta = 0.56 mm/s and quadrupole splitting delta EQ = 0.54 mm/s. A minor product containing high-valent iron is suggested by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and is proposed to originate from [((cyclam-acetato)Fe)2(mu-N)]2+ with a mixed-valent (FeIV(mu-N)FeIII))4+S = 1/2 core. Exposure of 3 to a stream of oxygen/ozone at low temperatures (-80 degrees C) in acetone/water results in a single oxidized product with an isomer shift delta = 0.01 mm/s and quadrupole splitting delta EQ = 1.37 mm/s. A spin-Hamiltonian analysis of the magnetic M\u00f6ssbauer yields parameters similar to those of compound II of horseradish peroxidase which are consistent with an FeIV=O monomeric complex (S = 1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Strahlenchemie, Stiftstrasse 34-36, D-45470 M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grapperhaus", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mienert", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bill", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weyherm\u00fcller", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wieghardt", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inorg Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0366543", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1669"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11187471", "10.1021/ic0005238"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
