So, this study aims to determine the influence of industrial activity as reflected by the value of its imports and exports, wind speed, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) on the high concentration of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub>. The method used is the econometric Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) approach to capture the existence of a short-term and long-term relationship between tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> and its predictor variables. The data used in this study is in the form of monthly time series data for the 2018-2022 period sourced from satellite images (Sentinel-5P and ECMWF Climate Reanalysis) and publications of the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS-Statistics Indonesia). The results explained that, in the short-term, tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> influence each other as they would in a photochemical reaction. In the long-term, exports from the industrial sector and wind speed have a significant effect on the concentration of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub>. The short-term effect occurs directly in the first month after the shock, while the long-term effect occurs in the second month after the shock. Wind gusts originating from industrial areas cause air conditions to be even more alarming because tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> pollutants spread throughout the region in West Java. Based on the coefficient correlation result, the high number of pneumonia cases is one of the impacts caused by air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
