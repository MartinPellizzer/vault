The ozonation reaction was very effective for elimination of microcystin; solutions of concentration up to 5 mg/L MC-LR were totally oxidized by an ozone dosage of 2 mg/L. Reactions were dependent on ozone dose, temperatures, and pH. A more effective reaction took place at a higher ozone dose, higher temperatures, and more acidic pH. Spectrophotometer analysis was used to study the ozonation kinetics. Reactions were very fast: with an initial ozone concentration of 2 mg/L the half-life time of the toxins was less than 20 s. Ozonation reaction was successfully modeled to an overall second-order kinetics and with first-order kinetics for both ozone and toxins. Overall rate constants (K) were found to be 6.79 x 10(4) M(-1)s(-1) for MC-LR and 2.45 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1) for MC-RR at 20 degrees C, with a pH of 2. The main degradation intermediates and the toxicity of the treated solution were also evaluated. The identified by-products were related to ozone dose. The high available ozone concentration degraded the toxins into smaller by-products and led to a ring opening. On the other hand, at a low ozone dose larger intermediates were detected. The treated solution toxicity was also found to be related to the ozone available in the aqueous solution; a high ozone dose led to cleavage of the Adda side chain from the toxin and reduced the toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Mutah University, Karak, Jordan. fares1233@mutah.edu.jo"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al Momani", "ForeName": "Fares A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jarrah", "ForeName": "Nabeel", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CZ021GH33H", "NameOfSubstance": "microcystin RR"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EQ8332842Y", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanoginosin LR"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20390920", "10.1080/10934521003648933", "920343431"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
