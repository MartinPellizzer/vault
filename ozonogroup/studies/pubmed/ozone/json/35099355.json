In recent years, the treatment of itchy skin diseases (eczema and atopic dermatitis) using trace ozone has also received attention. However, the feasibility of using trace ozone to replace personal care products (PCPs) has rarely been analyzed. In this study, the applicability of trace ozone was evaluated in terms of its efficiency for microbial inactivation in three types of skin microbiomes, cleaning performance on simulated human hair and epidermis, safety for simulated human hair, and contribution to emission reduction. The results revealed that at a 10:1 ratio of ozonated water to bacterial suspension, the inactivation ratios of <i>Malassezia</i>, <i>C. albicans</i>, and <i>S. epidermidis</i> reached 99.63%, 83.47%, and 100%, respectively. In addition, the cleaning performance of an ozone solution (0.4 mg/L) for simulated human skin contaminated with carbon black and sebum could reach 95.89% and 95.63%, respectively, with 5 min of washing. The average scores were 0.40 and 0.37 after 5 min and 10 min of ozone treatments, respectively, indicating that trace ozone does not significantly damage simulated human hair. Results also revealed that the total emissions of COD, TP, and TN would be reduced by 1.29\u00d710<sup>6</sup>, 3.55\u00d710<sup>3</sup>, and 3.63\u00d710<sup>3</sup> mg/ (household \u00b7 year), respectively, if PCPs are replaced by trace ozone. In short, our findings indicate that trace ozone is a potential alternative to PCPs. By replacing PCPs with trace ozone, the use of synthetic chemical products can be reduced and carbon emissions from oil extraction can be countered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, PR People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yanyan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhou", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yanzeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuantao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiamen University, Xiamen, PR People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Chengsong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Confosin Technology Co.
