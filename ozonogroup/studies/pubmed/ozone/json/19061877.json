The results demonstrated that CFTR staining was decreased in rat airway epithelium under ozone stress. Ozone stress also down-regulated CFTR protein and mRNA expression and CFTR chloride current in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). STAT1 signal pathway was checked to investigate the signal mechanism. It was found that pretreatment with STAT1 inhibitor attenuated the down-regulated CFTR expression induced by ozone stress. We also observed that ozone stress accelerated the phosphorylation of STAT1 in HBEC, which could be influenced by some signaling molecules related to the early transduction of cellular stress. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species inhibitors N-acetylcysteine and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor aminoguanidine increased the expression of CFTR. Ozone stress could down-regulate the expression of CFTR and decrease CFTR chloride current in HBEC. The signal mechanism which referred to cascade events in cells included early oxidative stress signal transmission molecules, and subsequently transcription modulator STAT1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Central South University Xiangya Medical School, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qun", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Yan-Ru", "Initials": "YR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Yu-Rong", "Initials": "YR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hui-Jun", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Li-Hua", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chi", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lin", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "0227276", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "STAT1 Transcription Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "STAT1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrphostins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126880-72-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "STAT1 Transcription Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrphostins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19061877", "10.1016/j.cbi.2008.10.059", "S0009-2797(08)00618-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
