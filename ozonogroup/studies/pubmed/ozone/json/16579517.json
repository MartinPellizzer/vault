Both endotracheal instillation of BLM and O3 exposure both produce lung inflammation and fibrosis. Oxidative stress would be a common mechanism of damage for both BLM and O3. Our aim was to assess lung injury induced by 5 and 60 days of intermittent exposure to 0.25 ppm O3 in rats with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Thirty-day-old Sprague Dawley rats were endotracheally instilled with BLM (1 U/100 g body weight) and, 30 days later, exposed to 0.25 ppm 03 (0.25 ppm 4 h per day, 5 days a week). Histopatology controls were instilled with saline and breathing room air. Histopathological evaluation of lungs was done 5 and 60 days after O3 exposure. BLM-induced lung damage did not change after 60 days of intermittent O3 exposure. Five days of O3 exposure increased the mean score of BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis (p=0.06). Frequency of bronchopneumonia increased from 1/7 to 6/6 (p <0.001), suggesting that a short-term exposure to O3 in a previously damaged lung might be a risk factor for developing further lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. moyarzun@med.uchile.cl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oyarz\u00fan", "ForeName": "Manuel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dussaubat", "ForeName": "Nelson", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "Sergio", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9308271", "ISSNLinking": "0716-9760"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "11056-06-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Bleomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bleomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchopneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16579517", "10.4067/s0716-97602005000400007", "S0716-97602005000400007"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
