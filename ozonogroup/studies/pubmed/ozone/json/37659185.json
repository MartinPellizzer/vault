Bacterial chlorine resistance has been found positively correlated with extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion. In this study, we selected the most suitable CRB controlling method against eight bacterial strains with different chlorine resistance among chloramine, ozone, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, analyzed the resistance mechanisms, clarified the contribution of EPS to disinfection resistance, and explored the role of carbon source metabolism capacity. Among all the disinfectants, UV disinfection showed the highest disinfection capacity by achieving the highest average and median log inactivation rates for the tested strains. For Bacillus cereus CR19, the strain with the highest chlorine resistance, 40 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> UV showed a 1.90 log inactivation, which was much higher than that of 2\u00a0mg-Cl<sub>2</sub>/L chlorine (0.67 log), 2\u00a0mg-Cl<sub>2</sub>/L chloramine (1.68 log), and 2\u00a0mg/L ozone (0.19 log). Meanwhile, the UV resistance of the bacteria did not correlate with EPS secretion. These characteristics render UV irradiation the best CRB controlling disinfection method. Chloramine was found to have a generally high inactivation efficiency for bacteria with high chlorine-resistance, but a low inactivation efficiency for low chlorine-resistant ones. Although EPS consumed up to 56.7% of chloramine which an intact bacterial cell consumed, EPS secretion could not explain chloramine resistance. Thus, chloramine is an acceptable CRB control method. Similar to chlorine, ozone generally selected high EPS-secreting bacteria, with EPS consuming up to 100% ozone. Therefore, ozone is not an appropriate method for controlling CRB with high EPS secretion. EPS played an important role in all types of disinfection resistance, and can be considered the main mechanism for bacterial chlorine and ozone disinfection resistance. However, as EPS was not the main resistance mechanism in UV and chloramine disinfection, CRB with high EPS secretion were inactivated more effectively. Furthermore, carbon source metabolism was found related to the multiple resistance of bacteria. Those with low carbon source metabolism capacity tended to have higher multiple resistance, especially to chlorine, ozone, and UV light. Distinctively, among the tested gram-negative bacteria, in contrast to other disinfectants, chloramine resistance was negatively correlated with EPS secretion and positively correlated with carbon source metabolism capacity, suggesting a special disinfection mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
