Two separate water distribution networks were studied; network 1 which supplies the surgical intensive care units, and network 2 which supplies the medical intensive care units and the emergency room. Network 1 has been disinfected by ozonation since 1995, and network 2 has been disinfected by ionisation since 1999. The hot water temperature was increased from 50 to 65 degrees C in 1998 and 2000 in networks 1 and 2, respectively. Water samples and swabs of the water outlets were cultured for Legionella spp. between four and six times each year, providing data before and after implementation of the disinfection procedures. There was no significant difference in the proportion of samples positive for Legionella spp. after ozonation in network 1 or after ionization in network 2. In both networks, there was a significant reduction in legionella isolates after increasing the hot water temperature to 65 degrees C. Maintaining the hot water temperature above 50 degrees C throughout both networks proved to be the most effective control measure in our hospital."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Preventive Medicine, University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blanc", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carrara", "ForeName": "Ph", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zanetti", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Francioli", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Hosp Infect", "NlmUniqueID": "8007166", "ISSNLinking": "0195-6701"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Hosp Infect. 2006 Jan;62(1):119. doi: 10.1016/j.jhin.2005.06.007", "PMID": "16214260"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Heating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals, University"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Infection Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Legionella pneumophila"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maintenance and Engineering, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sanitary Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15823660", "10.1016/j.jhin.2004.10.016", "S0195-6701(04)00507-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
