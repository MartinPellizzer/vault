The VOC sources were identified by diagnostic ratios and positive matrix factorization (PMF), and environmental impact of VOCs on O<sub>3</sub> and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) were evaluated. The results showed that the average VOC concentration was (82.1\u00b122.7) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, with alkanes being the most abundant group (51.8%), followed by aromatics (17.8%), alkenes (8.0%), and alkynes (3.8%). The diurnal variation of VOCs exhibited a bimodal trend, with twin peaks appearing at 08:00-10:00 and 18:00-20:00, falling to a valley at 12:00-14:00. The results for benzene/toluene (2.1\u00b11.3) and isopentane/<i>n</i>-pentane (1.7\u00b10.6) showed that the ambient VOCs may be influenced by coal combustion and vehicular emissions. Six sources were extracted by PMF:coal combustion (34.9%), vehicle emissions (18.2%), gasoline evaporation (15.2%), industrial emissions (13.6%), biogenic emissions (9.2%), and solvent usage (9.0%). The average concentration of ozone formation potential (OFP) was 156.6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, with the highest contribution from alkenes, while the average concentration of secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOA<sub>p</sub>) was 68.7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, mainly from aromatics (93.4%). In summary, coal combustion was the most abundant source of VOCs, and accelerating the management of coal gangue and energy structure readjustment are the key points to address. Meanwhile, restricting the VOCs from vehicle emissions, gasoline evaporation, and industrial emissions is also required."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Yue-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhuo-Cheng", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy, Power and Mechanical Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ru-Mei", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Qian-Zhuo", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Meng-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yu-Long", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Dong-Mei", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental System Optimization, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608878", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201912253"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
