Here, a novel hybrid model of multi-task oriented CNN-BiLSTM-Attention was proposed and performed in Taiyuan during 2015-2020 to synchronously and quickly quantify the impact of anthropogenic and meteorological factors on the six criteria pollutants variations. Empirical results revealed the residential and transportation sectors distinctly decreased SO<sub>2</sub> by 25\u00a0% and 22\u00a0% and CO by 12\u00a0% and 10\u00a0%. Gradual downward trends for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> were mainly ascribed to the stringent measures implemented in transportation and power sectors as part of the Blue Sky Defense War, which were further reinforced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, temperature-dependent adverse meteorological effects (27\u00a0%) and anthropogenic intervention (12\u00a0%) jointly increased O<sub>3</sub> by 39\u00a0%. The O<sub>3</sub>-driven pollution events may be inevitable or even become more prominent under climate warming. The industrial (5\u00a0%) and transportation sectors (6\u00a0%) were mainly responsible for the anthropogenic-driven increase of O<sub>3</sub> and precursor NO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Synergistic reduction of precursors (VOCs and NOx) from industrial and transportation sectors requires coordination with climate actions to mitigate the temperature-dependent O<sub>3</sub>-driven pollution, thereby improving regional air quality. Meanwhile, the proposed model is expected to be applied flexibly in various regions to quantify the drivers of the pollutant variations in a warming climate, with the potential to offer valuable insights for improving regional air quality in near future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
