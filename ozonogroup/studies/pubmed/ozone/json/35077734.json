Cluster analysis classified six sites into two groups with similar features of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. The first group consists of four urban/suburban sites, Windsor, Allen Park and Lansing in Michigan, and Erie in Ohio, and the second group includes two rural sites, Delaware and National Trail School in Ohio. The similarities among all six sites include (1) diurnal and seasonal variability of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations owing to similar weather conditions, and (2) decreasing peak O<sub>3</sub> (95<sup>th</sup> percentile) concentrations due to reduced emissions of precursors, thus less photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation. However, how O<sub>3</sub> levels changed with reduced NO<sub>X</sub> emissions during the study period and on weekends differed between the two groups. Lower O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were recorded at urban/suburban sites (30\u00a0ppb) than at rural sites (34\u00a0ppb). At urban sites, annual smog season O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased by 0.12-3.2\u00a0ppb/year. The increasing trends occurred at all percentile levels except for 95<sup>th</sup> percentile and in most months, due to weakened NO titration effect. At the rural sites, smog-season O<sub>3</sub> concentrations decreased by 0.01-2.71\u00a0ppb/year. The decreasing trends were observed at 50-95<sup>th</sup> percentile levels and in most months. Between the two groups, the urban/suburban group had a greater increment in weekend O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (3.3 vs. 1.6\u00a0ppb) due to a greater reduction of local NO emissions on weekend, thus, weakened NO titration effect. Overall, O<sub>3</sub> formation was more sensitive to VOCs during the study period; however, the O<sub>3</sub> formation regime gradually shifted toward more sensitive to NO<sub>X</sub> during 1996-2007 then became more sensitive to VOCs during 2008-2015. Therefore, controlling anthropogenic VOC emissions is needed to effectively mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the study region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2022.
