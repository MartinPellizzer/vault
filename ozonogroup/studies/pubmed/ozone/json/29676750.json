The results indicated that with ozonation alone for 60min, the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) could reach 34%. The introduction of activated carbon, pumice, \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> carriers improved the removal performance of COD, and the removal efficiency was increased by 8.6%, 4.2%, 2%, respectively. Supported with Mn, the catalytic performance of activated carbon and \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were improved significantly with COD removal efficiencies of 46.5% and 41.3%, respectively; however, the promotion effect of pumice supported with Mn was insignificant. Activated carbon supported with Mn had the best catalytic performance. The catalytic ozonation combined system of MnO<sub>X</sub>/activated carbon could keep ozone concentration at a lower level in the liquid phase, and promote the transfer of ozone from the gas phase to the liquid phase to improve ozonation efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China E-mail: youhong@hit.edu.cn; School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhipeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China E-mail: youhong@hit.edu.cn; School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China E-mail: youhong@hit.edu.cn; School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China E-mail: youhong@hit.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo N2 L 3G1, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29676750", "10.2166/wst.2018.073"]}}]}
