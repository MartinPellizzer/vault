Some undesired byproducts, however, are produced in these processes. Of them, bromate has attracted the most intensive attention. It was previously regarded as a byproduct that typically occurred in ozone-based oxidation processes. However, for the past decade, bromate formation has been detected in other oxidation processes such as CuO-catalyzed chlorination, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>-based oxidation, and ferrate oxidation processes. This review summarizes the occurrences, mechanisms, influencing factors, risk assessment, and control strategies of bromate formation in the four oxidation processes, i.e., ozone-based oxidation, chlorine-based oxidation, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>-based oxidation, and ferrate oxidation. Besides, some unresolved issues for future studies are provided: (1) Clarification of the relative contributions of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and Br to the oxidation of bromine for bromate formation in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>-based oxidation processes; (2) evaluation of the role of different reactive species in the bromate formation in the process of UV/HOCl; (3) quantification of the dual role of alkalinity in bromate formation during ozonation; (4) assessment of the risks of bromate formation in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>-based oxidation processes for practical applications; and (5) exploration of strategies for inhibiting bromate formation in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>-based oxidation, UV/chlorine, and metal oxide-catalyzed chlorination processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
