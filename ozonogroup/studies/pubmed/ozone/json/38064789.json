Using satellite-based spatial-temporal models, prenatal exposure to air pollutants including particulate matter with an aerodynamic dimension of < 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was assessed at each woman's residence. Latent class growth modeling was used to identify trajectories of physical (body length and weight) growth and neurodevelopment, which were repeatedly measured within 1 year after birth. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between prenatal exposure to air pollution and the risks of growth disorders, adjusting for an array of potential confounders.", "We identified two growth trajectories for body length [normal: 3829 (93%); retardation: 288 (7%)], three for weight [normal: 2475 (59.6%); retardation: 390 (9.4%); overgrowth: 1287 (31%)], and two for neurodevelopment [normal: 956 (66.1%); retardation: 491 (33.9%)]. For exposure over whole pregnancy, SO<sub>2</sub> was associated with an increased risk of body length retardation (OR for per 1\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increment: 1.09, 95%CI: 1.01-1.17); PM<sub>2.5</sub> (OR: 1.05, 95%CI: 1.03-1.07), SO<sub>2</sub> (OR: 1.15, 95%CI: 1.08-1.22), and NO<sub>2</sub> (OR: 1.05, 95%CI: 1.03-1.07) were positively associated with neurodevelopmental retardation. Such associations appeared stronger for exposures over the first and second trimesters. No significant associations were detected for weight growth.", "Maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy was associated with higher risks of impairments in both physical growth, particularly body length, and neurodevelopment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
