Patients must have at least one (but no more than three) postoperative wounds in the site of surgery (ulcers, eschars and sores) and at least one symptom (pain, burning, redness and malodour) and at least one sign (erythema, local warmth, swelling and purulent secretion) of infection of at least moderate intensity (score \u22652) in the target lesion at the screening visit (patients with wounds without signs of localised infection or with undermining wounds will be excluded).Patients (n=186) will be recruited from five Italian hospitals and studied for 7 weeks. All will be assigned to one of the two treatment groups according to a web-based, centralised randomisation procedure and placed into either the (1) intervention: oxygen-ozone therapy 2-3 times a week for 6 weeks (for a maximum of 15 sessions) simultaneously with an appropriate oral antibiotic therapy prescribed at baseline or (2) control: oral antibiotic therapy prescribed at baseline.The primary outcome is the efficacy and superiority of the treatment (ozone and oral antibiotic therapies); secondary outcomes include the resolution of signs and symptoms, modifications in lesion size and the treatment's safety and tolerability.", "This study has been reviewed and approved by the responsible Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of COMITATO ETICO CAMPANIA NORD, located at 'Azienda Ospedaliera San Giuseppe Moscati di Avellino'.After completion of the study, the project coordinator will prepare a draft manuscript containing the final results of the study on the basis of the statistical analysis. The manuscript will be derived by the co-authors for comments, and after revision, it will be sent to a major scientific journal.
