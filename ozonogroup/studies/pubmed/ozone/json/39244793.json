However, the ability of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), the most reactive gaseous component of air pollution, to function as a modulator during sensitization is not well established. C57BL/6\u00a0J male mice were intranasally sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) (40\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) for 3 weeks on alternate days in parallel with once-a-week O<sub>3</sub> exposure (1\u00a0ppm). Mice were euthanized 24\u00a0h following the last HDM challenge. Lung lavage, histology, lung function (both forced oscillation and forced expiration-based), immune cell profiling, inflammation (pulmonary and systemic), and immunoglobulin production were assessed. Compared to HDM alone, HDM\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> leads to a significant increase in peribronchial inflammation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), perivascular inflammation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and methacholine-provoked large airway hyperreactivity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Serum total IgG and IgE and HDM-specific IgG1 were 3-5 times greater in HDM\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> co-exposure compared to PBS and O<sub>3</sub>-exposed groups. An increase in activated/mature lung total and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as well as T-activated, and T memory lymphocyte subset numbers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were noted in the HDM\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> group compared to HDM alone group. Concurrent O<sub>3</sub> inhalation and HDM sensitization also caused significantly greater (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lung tissue interleukin-17 pathway gene expression and mediator levels in the serum. Redox imbalance was manifested by impaired lung antioxidant defense and increased oxidants. O<sub>3</sub> inhalation during allergic sensitization coalesces in generating a significantly worse T<sub>H</sub>17 asthmatic phenotype."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
