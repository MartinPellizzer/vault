However, its application in groundwater remediation is limited, partially due to the unclear effect of static water pressure on the oxidation efficiency. This study constructed a batch reactor to investigate the influence of static pressure on toluene oxidation by ozone micro-nano bubble water. To achieve constant pressure, weight was added above the mobile reactor roof, and the initial concentrations of toluene and dissolved ozone were 1.00\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.68\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that as the static water pressure increased from 0.0 to 2.5\u00a0m, the average microbubble diameter decreased significantly from 62.3 to 36.0\u00a0\u03bcm. Simultaneously, the oxidation percentage of toluene increased from 40.3% to 58.7%, and the reaction rate between toluene and hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b7) increased from 9.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup> to 1.39\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>10</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, indicating that the shrinkage of micro-nano bubbles generated an abundance of OH\u00b7 that quickly oxidized toluene adsorbed at the bubble interface. A greater enhancement of oxidation efficiency for nitrobenzene, as compared to p-xylene, was observed after the addition of 2.5\u00a0m water pressure, which verified the larger contribution of OH\u00b7 under static pressure. Although the improvement of oxidation efficiency was reduced under acid and alkaline environments, as well as in practical groundwater matrices, the overall results still demonstrated the promising application of micro-nano bubble ozonation in groundwater remediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
