When electrolysis was performed for 10 minutes using a direct-current electrolytic hydrogen-water generating bottle with tap water, \"residual free chlorine\" concurrently upon the production of molecular hydrogen (444 \u03bcg/L) could be appreciably decreased from 0.18 mg/L to 0.12 mg/L as quantified by a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine-dye colorimetric method. Moreover, the total chlorine concentration (residual bound chlorine plus free chlorine) was estimated to be decreased from 0.17 mg/L to 0.11 mg/L. Although a merit of electrolytic hydrogen-generating bottles exists in electrolysis for periods as short as 10 minutes, the 30-minute electrolysis brought about the more abundant hydrogen (479 \u03bcg/L) together with an oxidation-reduction potential of -245 mV; even upon this long-term electrolysis, the gross amounts of chlorine, hypochlorous acid and chloramine were shown not to be increased (0.09-0.10 mg/L from 0.11 mg/L for tap water) as detected by orthotolidine colorimetry. Above-mentioned levels of diverse-type chlorines might fulfill the World Health Organization guideline for drinking water below 5 mg/L. In addition, the dissolved ozone upon electrolytic generation of hydrogen-water was below the detection limit (< 0.05 mg/L) or undetectable, which fulfilled the official safety standards in Japan and the USA for drinking water below 0.1 mg/L, as evaluated by three methods such as an electrode-type ozone checker, indigo dye-utilizing ozone detector capillaries and potassium iodide-based colorimetry. Importantly, even when half the amount of tap water was poured into the tank of the apparatus and electrolyzed, both the residual chlorine and ozone concentrations measured were also below the safety standard. Thus, major potently harmful substances, such as residual free/bound chlorine, or hypochlorous-acid/chloramine, respectively, and dissolved ozone, as the drinking hydrogen-water was direct-current-electrolytically generated, were estimated to be repressed within safety concentration ranges with achievements of abundant hydrogen generation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Incorporated Association the Institute for Hydrogen Medicine, Kobe, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hatae", "ForeName": "Toshihisa", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Incorporated Association the Institute for Hydrogen Medicine, Kobe; Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, Shobara, Japan."}], "LastName": "Miwa", "ForeName": "Nobuhiko", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Med Gas Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101564536", "ISSNLinking": "2045-9912"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7YNJ3PO35Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflicts of interest</b> There is no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ohsawa I, Ishikawa M, Takahashi K, et al.
