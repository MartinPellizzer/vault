The role of pH changes, point of zero charges and the effect of catalyst dose on pH change was studied. The results reveal that the overall removal efficiency of RR-241 in the case of COPs was the highest compared with single ozonation process (at pH = 7 the efficiency was 80, 65 65.5 and 60% for AC/O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>, Zeolite/O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> respectively). At initial acidic pH 4, the highest pH variations in COPs and ozonation processes were observed. Moreover, the pH changes were not found to be significant near the point of zero charges of materials (pH<sub>pzc</sub> = 6.8, 8.4 and 8.8 for zeolite, activated carbons and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, respectively. The COP in the presence of activated carbon shows the highest removal efficiency (82%) at pH 7. The material dose effect indicates that increasing the amount of catalyst (from 1 gm to 2 gm) significantly leads to a change in the pH of the solution. Results reveal the prominent effect and significance of pH changes on the efficiency of COP to determine true catalytic efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore 54890, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sajjad", "ForeName": "Samra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore 54890, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ikhlaq", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Polymer Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Faisalabad Campus, Faisalabad, Pakistan E-mail: farhan.javed@uet.edu.pk."}], "LastName": "Javed", "ForeName": "Farhan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Polymer Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Faisalabad Campus, Faisalabad, Pakistan E-mail: farhan.javed@uet.edu.pk."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Syed Waqas", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Forestry University, No. 35 Qinghua East Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33600375", "10.2166/wst.2020.609"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
