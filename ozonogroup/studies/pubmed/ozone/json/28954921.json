Higher levels of particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcm were associated with higher odds of severe stroke among those in higher disadvantage areas (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.55) but not in lower disadvantage areas (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.22; <i>P</i> interaction =0.097).", "Air pollution exposures and neighborhood socioeconomic status may be important in understanding stroke severity.
