Visibility codes for present weather conditions identified days when airborne dust or smoke was observed. The associations between PM and hospitalisations were estimated using time-stratified case-crossover analyses controlling for covariates including temperature, relative humidity, other pollutants, day of the week and public holidays.", "Mean PM(10) concentrations were higher in the warm season, whereas PM(2.5) concentrations were higher in the cool season. Hospital admissions were associated with PM(10) in the cool season and with PM(2.5) in both seasons. No significant effect of PM on all-age respiratory admissions was detected, however cardiovascular admissions were associated with both PM(2.5) and PM(10) in the cool season with the highest effects for PM(2.5) (4.48%, 95% CI: 0.74%, 8.36% increase per 10\u03bcg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5)).", "These findings suggest that despite the city's relatively low levels of air pollution, PM concentrations are associated with increases in morbidity in Adelaide.
