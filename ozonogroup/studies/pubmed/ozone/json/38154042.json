While sunlight exposure is advised to reduce the risk of Br-DBPs, their phototransformation pathways remain insufficiently understood. Here, sunlight irradiation was found to reduce adsorbable organic bromine by 63%. Applying high-resolution mass spectrometry, the study investigated transformations of dissolved organic matter in sunlit-ozonated reclaimed water, revealing the number and abundance of assigned formulas decreased after irradiation. The Br-DBPs with O/C < 0.6 and MW > 400 Da were decreased or removed after irradiation, with the majority being CHOBr compounds. The peak intensity reduction ratio of CHOBr compounds correlated positively with double bound equivalent minus oxygen ratios but negatively with O/C, suggesting that photo-susceptible CHOBr compounds were highly unsaturated. Mass difference analysis revealed that the photodegradation pathways were mainly oxidation aligned with debromination. Three typical CHOBr molecular structures were resolved, and their photoproducts were proposed. Toxicity estimates indicated decreased toxicity in these photoproducts compared to their parent compounds, in line with experimentally determined values. Our proposed phototransformation pathways for Br-DBPs enhance our comprehension of their degradation and irradiation-induced toxicity reduction in reclaimed water, further illuminating their transformation under sunlight in widespread environmental scenarios."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Ecological Remediation and Carbon Sequestration, Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control, Institute of Environment and Ecology, Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, P.
