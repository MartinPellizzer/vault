The experiment used medical grade five titanium discs on which peri-implant isolated biofilms were grown. The experimental groups were control, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Granulicatella adiacens (G. adiacens), (n = 6). The oral microbes grown on titanium discs were exposed to ozone gel for 3 minutes and the antibacterial activity was assessed by turbidity test and adherence test for the antibiofilm activity test. Bacterial morphology and confluence were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), (n=3). Two bacterial species were identified from the peri-implant sample, S. mutans and G. adiacens. The results showed that adding ozone to the bacterial biofilm on titanium dental implants did not exhibit significant antibacterial activity against S. mutans. Moreover, there was no significant difference in antibiofilm activity between control and treatment groups. However, significant antibacterial and antibiofilm effect was exhibited by ozone gel against G. adiacens. Ozonated olive oil can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for disinfecting dental implant surfaces and treating peri-implantitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, Tishk International University, Erbil, Iraq. ranj.nadhim@tiu.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "Salaie", "ForeName": "Ranj Nadhim", "Initials": "RN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kurdistan Higher Council of Medical Specialties, Erbil, Iraq. shehab.ahmed@khcms.edu.krd."}], "LastName": "Hamad", "ForeName": "Shehab Ahmed", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, College of Dentistry, Hawler Medical University, Erbil, Iraq. zhalla.meran@hmu.edu.krd."}], "LastName": "Meran", "ForeName": "Zhala Dara", "Initials": "ZD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Olive Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Implants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Olive Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Peri-Implantitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Implants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38836689", "10.14715/cmb/2024.70.6.1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
