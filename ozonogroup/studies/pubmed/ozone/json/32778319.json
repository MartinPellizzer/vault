Nevertheless, a systematic investigation has not yet been carried out for the coupled MBR\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> process through an experimental design approach. Thereby, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of different processes (membrane bioreactor-MBR, ozonation; and integrated MBR\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>) for removing the antibiotic sulfadiazine (SDZ) from a synthetic wastewater matrix of industrial interest. The MBR behavior was monitored over seven months for different parameters (pH, temperature, permeate flow, transmembrane pressure, biological oxygen demand-BOD<sub>5</sub>, chemical oxygen demand-COD, total organic carbon-TOC, solids, and SDZ concentration). Additionally, the amount of SDZ sorbed onto the sludge was characterized, an issue which is scarcely addressed in most research works. Ozonation experiments were conducted in batch mode in a 2-L glass reactor provided with openings for gas flow. For the MBR\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> process, the effects of gas flow rate (0.1-1.5\u00a0L\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) and inlet ozone concentration (4-12\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) on SDZ removal from the MBR permeate were systematically assessed using a Doehlert experimental design and response surface methodology. The results indicated that the MBR system showed good performance regarding organic matter removal efficiency, evaluated in terms of BOD<sub>5</sub> (91.5%), COD (93.1%) and TOC (96.3%). In contrast, SDZ was partially removed (33%) by the MBR; in that case, the results indicated that the antibiotic was moderately removed with the sludge and partially biodegraded. In turn, the MBR\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> system showed excellent performance for removing SDZ (100%), TOC (97%), BOD<sub>5</sub> (94%) and COD (97%). The statistical analysis confirmed that the influence of ozone gas flow rate upon the SDZ removal rate was more important than that exhibited by inlet ozone concentration. Therefore, coupling MBR and ozone can be considered a promising alternative for point source treatment of antibiotic production wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
