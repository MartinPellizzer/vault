The highest bacteria inactivation rate (all the target pathogens were inactivated below the detection limit (DL) (100 CFU/100 mL) within 45 min treatment) was observed for ozonation (83 mgO<sub>3</sub>/L h). Similar inactivation behavior for all bacteria was observed for sunlight/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50 mg/L) and solar photo-Fenton (SPF) with EDDS (1:1 molar ratio, 0.1 mM of Fe and 50 mg/L of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Although the DL was not reached, faster inactivation kinetics (0.007, 0.013 and 0.002 1/min for E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp., respectively) and lower bacterial concentration after a 180 min treatment were observed for sunlight/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process compared to SPF (0.005, 0.01 1/min and no inactivation, respectively), Enterococcus spp. being the higher resistance microorganism. The negative effect of carbonates on disinfection performance was also evaluated. Quantitative microbial risk assessment for the ingestion of lettuce irrigated with untreated and treated WW was estimated. Disinfection by ozonation and sunlight/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processes were found to drastically decrease the associated microbiological risk (the mean risk of illness decreased from 0.10 (untreated) to 1.35 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> (treated) for E. coli and from 0.03 to 2.21 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup> for Salmonella)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
