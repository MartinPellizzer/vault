Minimally invasive group of patients was treated with the injection of oxygen-ozone combined with collagenase into the lumbar disc or the epidural space; the other group was treated with traditional surgery.

There was no statistically significant difference between two groups at 3 and 12 months (P=0.123, P=0.08). However, the surgical group produced a statistically significant greater improvement for back pain and disability in the first few weeks (P=0.0001).
