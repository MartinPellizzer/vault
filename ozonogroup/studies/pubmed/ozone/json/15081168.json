The CMP wastewater, as obtained from a large semiconductor manufacturer, was characterized by a high oxide particle content, high turbidity (NTU), and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration up to 500 mg/l. Due to these characteristics, treatment of the CMP wastewater by either filtration or by traditional activated sludge method was inadequate. In the present work, physical methods consisting of chemical coagulation and reverse osmosis were employed to tackle the turbidity and COD problems. Experimental tests were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and to identify the optimum operating conditions. Test results clearly demonstrated the complementary advantages of the two methods. The treatment was capable of realizing over 99% oxide particle removal and lowering the wastewater COD to below 100 mg/l. The overall water quality of the final effluent was excellent and can be considered for reuse. Preliminary treatment of the RO retentate by ozonation was also attempted. The COD removal achieved in the ozonation was over 80% in an hour, rendering the treated RO retentate suitable for direct discharge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Chungli 320, Taiwan, ROC. ceshlin@saturn.yzu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Sheng H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chung R", "Initials": "CR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manufactured Materials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metallurgy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Semiconductors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15081168", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2004.01.014", "S0304389404000718"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
