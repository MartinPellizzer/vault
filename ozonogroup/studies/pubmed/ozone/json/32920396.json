Previous studies found an association between O<sub>3</sub> and cardiorespiratory mortality. However, evidence was limited regarding the risk of O<sub>3</sub> on mortality from other diseases. In this study, we aimed to estimate the association between O<sub>3</sub> and mortality from a broad spectrum of diseases in Guangzhou, China, which has experienced a rapid increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration over the past decades. Daily data were obtained on cause-specific mortality, air pollutant concentrations and weather conditions during 2013-2018. A generalized additive model with quasi-Poisson regression was applied to examine the association between O<sub>3</sub> and mortality from 10 broad causes and 26 refined subcategories, with adjustment of long-term and seasonal trends, weather conditions, public holidays and days of the week. We found that the threshold concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> were 40\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for all-cause, non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Mortality risk increased monotonically with O<sub>3</sub> concentrations above the threshold. Per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of O<sub>3</sub> at lag 0-3\u00a0days was associated with 0.54% (95%CI: 0.34-0.74%), 0.56% (95%CI: 0.36-0.76%), 0.59% (95%CI: 0.30-0.88%), 0.78% (95%CI: 0.33-1.24%) and 0.52% (95%CI: 0.21-0.83%) elevated risk of death from all causes, non-accidental causes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and neoplasms, respectively. Among the subcategories, the largest effect estimate was observed in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The elderly suffered from a higher mortality risk from O<sub>3</sub>. Stringent emission control strategies and multi-sectoral collaborations are needed to reduce the detrimental impact of O<sub>3</sub> on vulnerable populations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
