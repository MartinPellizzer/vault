Ozone treatment (4 min) of pH 3.0 apple juice resulted in >5.36 log CFU ml(-1) reduction of E. coli O157:H7. Ozone treatment of pH 4.0 and 5.0 apple juice for 4 min reduced this pathogen by 5.12 log CFU ml(-1) and 1.86 log CFU ml(-1) respectively. The combination of low pH and ozone showed a great antimicrobial effect in apple juice. Salm. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes showed a reduction trend similar to E. coli O157:H7. There were no significant changes of colour values when apple juice was treated with ozone, except for b values. Among all ozone treated samples, the browning index was lower than that of nontreated samples and there were no significant differences in total phenolic contents.", "In conclusion, ozone treatment of low pH apple juice was significantly effective in inactivation of foodborne pathogens while maintaining acceptable apple juice quality.", "The antimicrobial effect of ozone treatment on foodborne pathogens in apple juice can be reinforced by lowering the pH of apple juice."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Animal Biotechnology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Center for Food and Bioconvergence, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institutes of Green Bio Science & Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang-gun, Korea."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "W-J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Animal Biotechnology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Center for Food and Bioconvergence, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institutes of Green Bio Science & Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang-gun, Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "J-Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Animal Biotechnology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Center for Food and Bioconvergence, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institutes of Green Bio Science & Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang-gun, Korea."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Animal Biotechnology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Center for Food and Bioconvergence, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institutes of Green Bio Science & Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang-gun, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "D-H", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Malus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26033289", "10.1111/jam.12861"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
