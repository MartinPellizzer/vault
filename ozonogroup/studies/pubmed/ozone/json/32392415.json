The Kigali amendment lists 17 HFCs that are currently in commercial use to be regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Future commercial applications may explore the use of other HFCs, most of which currently lack an evaluation of their climate metrics. In this work, atmospheric lifetimes, radiative efficiencies (REs), global warming potentials (GWPs), and global temperature change potentials (GTPs) for all saturated HFCs with fewer than 5 carbon atoms are estimated to help guide future usage and policy decisions. Atmospheric lifetimes were estimated using a structure activity relationship (SAR) for OH radical reactivity and estimated O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactivity. Radiative metrics were obtained using theoretically calculated infrared absorption spectra that were presented in a previous work. Calculations for some additional HFCs not included in the previous work were performed in this work. The HFCs display unique infrared spectra with strong absorption in the Earth's atmospheric infrared window region, primarily due to the C-F stretching vibration. Results from this study show that the HFC global atmospheric lifetimes and REs are dependent upon their H atom content and molecular structure. Therefore, the HFC radiative metric evaluation requires a case-by-case evaluation. A thorough experimental evaluation of a targeted HFC's atmospheric lifetime and climate metrics is always highly recommended. However, in cases where it is experimentally difficult to separate isomers, the new results from this study should help guide the experiments, as well as provide relevant climate metrics with uncertainties and policy relevant data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9532-6246"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Research Laboratory, Chemical Sciences Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80305, United States."}], "LastName": "Burkholder", "ForeName": "James B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, 1155 Union Circle Box 305070, Denton, Texas 76203-5070, United States."}], "LastName": "Marshall", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0843-3209"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California 94035, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BAER Institute, NASA Research Park, MS 18-4, Moffett Field, California 94035, United States."}], "LastName": "Bera", "ForeName": "Partha P", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5461-1486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environmental Science and Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6316, United States."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2598-2237"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California 94035, United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Timothy J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32392415", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c02679"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
