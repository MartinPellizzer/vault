The used PPE kits, potentially being infectious, pose a threat to human\u00a0health, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems, if not scientifically handled and disposed. However, with stressed resources on treatment facilities and lack of training to the health and\u00a0sanitation workers, it becomes vital to vet different options for PPE kits disposal, to promote environmentally sound management of waste. Given the various technology options available for treatment and disposal of COVID-19 patients waste, Life Cycle Assessment, i.e., cradle to grave analysis of PPE provides essential guidance in identifying the environmentally sound alternatives. In the present work, Life Cycle Assessment of PPE kits has been performed using GaBi version 8.7 under two disposal scenarios, namely landfill and incineration (both centralized and decentralized) for six environmental impact categories covering overall impacts on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, which includes Global Warming Potential (GWP), Human Toxicity Potential (HTP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Acidification Potential (AP), Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential (FAETP) and Photochemical Ozone Depletion Potential (POCP). Considering the inventories of PPE kits, disposal of PPE bodysuit has the maximum impact, followed by gloves and goggles, in terms of GWP. The use of metal strips in face-mask has shown the most significant HTP impact. The incineration process (centralized-3816\u00a0kg CO2 eq. and decentralized-3813\u00a0kg CO2 eq.) showed high GWP but significantly reduced impact w.r.t. AP, EP, FAETP, POCP and HTP, when compared to disposal in a landfill, resulting in the high overall impact of landfill disposal compared to incineration. The decentralized incineration has emerged as environmentally sound management option compared to centralized incinerator among all the impact categories, also the environmental impact by transportation is significant (2.76\u00a0kg CO2 eq.) and cannot be neglected for long-distance transportation. Present findings can help the regulatory authority to delineate action steps for safe disposal of PPE kits."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Springer Nature B.V. 2020."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.419340.b", "0000 0000 8848 8397"], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440 020 India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Harender", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.419340.b", "0000 0000 8848 8397"], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440 020 India."}], "LastName": "Azad", "ForeName": "Amaanuddin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.419340.b", "0000 0000 8848 8397"], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440 020 India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research [AcSIR], Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh 201 002 India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Ankit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United Nations Environment Programme, New Delhi, 110 003 India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Jitendra", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0043-2589"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.419340.b", "0000 0000 8848 8397"], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440 020 India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research [AcSIR], Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh 201 002 India."}], "LastName": "Bherwani", "ForeName": "Hemant", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.419340.b", "0000 0000 8848 8397"], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440 020 India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research [AcSIR], Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh 201 002 India."}], "LastName": "Labhsetwar", "ForeName": "Nitin Kumar", "Initials": "NK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.419340.b", "0000 0000 8848 8397"], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440 020 India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research [AcSIR], Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh 201 002 India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Rakesh", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Dev Sustain", "NlmUniqueID": "101769312", "ISSNLinking": "1387-585X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abhimanyu C.
