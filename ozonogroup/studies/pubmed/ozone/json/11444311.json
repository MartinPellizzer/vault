In this work, we have evaluated the capacity of treatment of a textile effluent using a biological and a chemical method using the sequence Phanerochaete chrysosporium-ozone. The fungal treatment was performed by direct incubation of a fungus spore suspension in textile effluent for nine days. Then, the effluent was ozonized at pH 11 and room temperature. Color, total organic carbon, molecular mass distribution and total phenols were determined. In biological experiments, enzymatic activity (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase) were also monitored. Toxicity tests were carried out with Scenedesmus subspicatus and with Escherichia coli. Good decoloration, total phenols reduction and textile effluent molecular mass reduction were obtained during the process. No significant total organic carbon reduction was observed. The toxicity of the textile effluent was reduced with both test organisms showing no inhibition at the end of the treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Chemistry Laboratory, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kunz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reginatto", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dur\u00e1n", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phanerochaete"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11444311", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00165-x", "S0045-6535(00)00165-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
