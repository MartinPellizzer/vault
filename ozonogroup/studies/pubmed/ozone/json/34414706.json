Since 2013, the government has strengthened air pollution controls in Beijing and achieved significant effects. A spatial-temporal analysis was conducted of the distribution and health impacts of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in Beijing, using data collected from 34 air quality monitoring sites between 2014 and 2020. In 2014, the annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> and seasonal (April to September) average of daily one-hourly maximum O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (O<sub>3_max</sub>) were 92.0 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 81.9 nmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. From 2014 to 2020, annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased at a rate of 7.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. However, there was no significant difference in O<sub>3_max</sub> over the years. The concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were highest in December and January (in winter) and lowest in August (in summer). On the contrary, O<sub>3_max</sub> was highest in June. The diurnal variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were affected by meteorological conditions and emission sources, and maximum concentrations occurred between 22:00 to 00:00, while minimum concentrations occurred between 14:00 to 16:00. The concentration of O<sub>3_max</sub> showed an opposite pattern, with minimum vales occurring at 07:00 and maximum values occurring in the afternoon. The spatial distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> showed similar patterns in 2014 and 2019, with the south of Beijing exhibiting the highest concentrations, and the north the lowest. The concentration of O<sub>3_max</sub> was higher in suburban areas than in traffic areas. In terms of health impacts, 1580 cases of cardiovascular disease and 821 of respiratory disease were attributed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> in 2014, while 2180 cases of respiratory disease were attributable to O<sub>3</sub> in 2014. In 2019, mortalities attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> had decreased by 50% compared to 2014. While the number of disease cases attributable to O<sub>3</sub> were similar in 2014 and 2019. the results indicate that PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in Beijing has been successfully controlled, while O<sub>3</sub> pollution has become more severe, and was the primary air pollutant threatening human health in 2019. Therefore, the synchronous control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> should be implemented in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jin-Long", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yan-Sen", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34414706", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202101033"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
