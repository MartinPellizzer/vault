This is especially the case for fluorine-based coatings, which often require fluorinated solvents for their processing and applications. These solvents are not only detrimental to the ozone layer but also represent a potential workplace hazard because they tend to bioaccumulate. We describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new fluorinated-polymer coating that can be simply applied to surfaces from an aqueous environment using a dip-coating technique. This was made possible by copolymerizing three different methacrylate monomers, each serving a specific function. Namely, fluorinated methacrylate providing oleo/hydrophobicity, photocleavable polyethylene glycol (PEG) methacrylate promoting water solubility of the copolymer, and thioether-based methacrylate serving as an anchoring unit to a number of different substrates. This copolymer is initially grafted to the surface as a monolayer from an aqueous solvent, after which the system is treated with ultraviolet (UV) light, cleaving away the protecting PEG moieties to yield an oleo/hydrophobic surface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Surface Science and Technology, Department of Materials, ETH Zurich, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Divandari", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Surface Science and Coating Technologies, Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Arcifa", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Swatch Group Research and Development Ltd, CH-2074 Marin, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Ayer", "ForeName": "Mathieu A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Swatch Group Research and Development Ltd, CH-2074 Marin, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Letondor", "ForeName": "Christophe", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7873-7905"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Surface Science and Technology, Department of Materials, ETH Zurich, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Spencer", "ForeName": "Nicholas D", "Initials": "ND"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33789046", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c00479"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
