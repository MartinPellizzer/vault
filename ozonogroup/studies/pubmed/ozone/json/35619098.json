The mental health of home-HCWs and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been clarified; therefore, we aimed to investigate the status and associated factors of fear of COVID-19 infection, anxiety, and depression among home-HCWs in Japan.", "We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional web-based anonymous survey of home-HCWs in August 2021, during the fifth wave of the pandemic in Japan. We surveyed members of facilities that provided home visit services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S-J) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) as objective variables, and the Japanese version of the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale-II (J-AITCS-II) as an explanatory variable.", "A total of 328 members of 37 facilities responded to the survey, and we ultimately analyzed 311 participants. The most frequent occupation was nurse (32.8%), followed by doctor (24.8%) and medical office staff (18.0%). The mean score of the FCV-19S-J was 16.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0 (7.0 - 31.0), and the prevalences of definitive anxiety and depression were 7.4% and 15.7%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the J-AITCS-II teamwork subscale was significantly negatively associated with FCV-19S-J, HADS-anxiety, and HADS-depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.171, p\u2009=\u20090.004; \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.151, p\u2009=\u20090.012; \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.225, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Medical office staff showed significant positive associations with FCV-19S-J and HADS-depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.219, p\u2009=\u20090.005; \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.201, p\u2009=\u20090.009, respectively), and medical social workers with HADS-anxiety and HADS-depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.166, p\u2009=\u20090.011; \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.214, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively) compared with doctors. The unmet support need for expert lectures on COVID-19 was significantly positively associated with FCV-19S-J (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.131, p\u2009=\u20090.048), and the unmet support need for support systems for psychological stress and emotional exhaustion was significantly positively associated with HADS-anxiety (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.141, p\u2009=\u20090.022).", "Fear of COVID-19 infection and depression of nurses, medical office staff, and other occupations was significantly higher than those of doctors. These findings suggest that non-physicians were more likely to be fearful and depressed during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, it is necessary to tailor mental health support based on occupation in the home care setting."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
