Destructive harvests were conducted at the end of the exposure period to determine dry weights of both above- and below-ground plant components. All cultivars had symptoms of visible injury in the twice-ambient treatment at both three and eight weeks after exposures began. No visible symptoms were observed at ambient ozone concentrations. At three weeks of exposure, 'Pink Delight' had the highest percentage of the leaves injured (PLI), 46.2%, followed by 'Opera' with a PLI of 23.3%. The other three cultivars had similar PLIs of less than 15%. After eight weeks of exposure, visible injury was equally severe on all cultivars with a mean PLI of 50.2% and mean Horsfall-Barratt rating of 5.4, indicating 12 to 25% of the leaf area was injured. No ozone x cultivar interaction was found for any growth variable measured. Across cultivars, growth index was reduced by 6%, total dry weight by 35%, and the number of developing floral buds and inflorescences by 29% for plants in twice-ambient ozone concentrations compared to ambient ozone concentrations. Percent biomass allocated to inflorescences was significantly greater for plants exposed to sub-ambient levels compared to those exposed to ozone at either ambient or twice-ambient concentrations. Results indicate that ozone levels similar to those in large urban areas in the southeastern United States have the potential to reduce growth and flowering of this important landscape plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture and School of Forestry, Auburn University, Alabama 36849, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Findley", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keever", "ForeName": "G J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chappelka", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eakes", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilliam", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093350", "10.1016/s0269-7491(97)00113-9", "S0269-7491(97)00113-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
