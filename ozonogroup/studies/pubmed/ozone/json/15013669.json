The ozonation of 2,4-D was found to follow a pseudo-first-order kinetic and the degradation rates depended on the initial pH and on the ozone concentration. A model was proposed to quantitatively predict the pseudo-first-order rate constants of the decay of 2,4-D under different ozone concentrations and initial pH levels based on some useful and practical assumptions. The proposed model was able to successfully describe the reaction with insignificant errors; therefore another practical equation was proposed to size the contact tower for 2,4-D ozonation by ozone concentration (overdosed) and initial pH level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Research Centre for Environmental Technology and Management, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China. cewchu@polyu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwan", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15013669", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2003.11.047", "S0045-6535(03)01189-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
