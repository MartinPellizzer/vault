Pearson), to investigate the role played by the ethylene receptor LE-ETR3 (NR) in mediating the plant response to ozone (O(3)). Tomato plants were used in a time-course experiment in which they were exposed to acute O(3) fumigation with 200 nl l(-1) O(3) for 4 h. The pattern of leaf lesions indicated similar sensitivities to O(3) for cv. Pearson and Nr. In both genotypes, O(3) activated a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-dependent oxidative burst, which was also ethylene-driven in Nr leaves. Ozone induced some ethylene and jasmonate biosynthetic and inducible genes, although with different timings and to different extents in the two genotypes. The overall data indicate that Nr retains partial sensitivity to ethylene, suggesting only a marginal role of the NR receptor in mediating the complex response of tomato plants to O(3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Biotechnology, University of Pisa, I-56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castagna", "ForeName": "Antonella", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Agro-Environmental and Animal Biotechnology, University of Perugia, I-06121, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ederli", "ForeName": "Luisa", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Agro-Environmental and Animal Biotechnology, University of Perugia, I-06121, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pasqualini", "ForeName": "Stefania", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sant'Anna School of University Studies and Doctoral Research, I-56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mensuali-Sodi", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Padova, I-35131 Padova, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baldan", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Biotechnology, University of Pisa, I-56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donnini", "ForeName": "Silvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Biotechnology, University of Pisa, I-56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ranieri", "ForeName": "Annamaria", "Initials": "A"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AF179249", "AF230371", "AF384374", "AY129402"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NEVER-RIPE protein, Lycopersicon esculentum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6RI5N05OWW", "NameOfSubstance": "jasmonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.14", "NameOfSubstance": "1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylate synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Baier M, Kandlbinder A, Golldack D, Dietz K-J. 2005.
