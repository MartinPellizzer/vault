Since the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, ozone levels have been recovering successfully. However, in the context of the current climate change, other factors such as changes in cloud patterns and an increased incidence of natural disasters (e.g. fires) may be disrupting this recovery. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different UV-B radiation levels on biofilms colonising heritage monuments. For this purpose, the effects of current UV-B levels on a biofilm composed of Synechocystis sp. (a cyanobacterium), Bracteacoccus minor (a green alga) and Fusarium sp. (a fungus) were compared at three points along a South-North transect: Portugal, Galicia (NW Spain) and Ireland (from highest to lowest UV-B radiation, respectively). Increased levels of UV-B radiation caused changes in the growth, physiological state and composition of subaerial biofilms, with cyanobacteria being more resistant than green algae to high levels of UV-B. A reduction of fungal growth and extracellular polymer substances (EPS) production was also observed, related to the reduction of biofilm aggregation at high UV-B levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
