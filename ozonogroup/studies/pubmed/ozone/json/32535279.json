However, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) was ubiquitous in wastewater, surface water, groundwater and even drinking water threating human health and ecology. In this study, the occurrence of six selected FQs in reclaimed water effluent and their removal by tertiary treatment units were investigated. The overall removal efficiencies in average of the tertiary treatment processes in Beijing and Changzhou were ranging from 21.2% to 55.2%. Activated carbon exhibited better performance for FQs removal than ozone and biological treatment such as membrane bioreactor, anaerobic-anoxic-oxic and biofilter. The results of two pilot study showed that the impact of reclaimed water to groundwater quality in terms of FQs concentration by direct injection in GBD was stronger than surface spreading in Changzhou, which might be due to the recharge strategy and the physical and chemical characteristics of sediment and aquifer soil. The hazard quotient (HQ) values of ofloxacin (OFL) in reclaimed water was up to 12.54, indicating the extreme eco-toxicological risk, while enrofloxacin (ENR) exhibited medium risk. After recharge with reclaimed water, the HQ values of OFL and ENR in groundwater ranged from low to medium ecological risk to the environment. Thus, the FQs in reclaimed water need to be paid more attention during their reuse for groundwater recharge, especially by direct injection. It is suggested that FQs should be considered in the priority substances lists in standards and guidelines of reclaimed water reuse for groundwater recharge to ensure the safety of groundwater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
