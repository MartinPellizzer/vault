We aimed to investigate whether air pollutants accelerate cognitive decline and affect neurobiological signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD).", "We used a population-based cohort from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey with 31,573 participants and a 10-year follow-up (5878 cognitively unimpaired individuals in Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey followed for 5.95 \u00b1 2.87 years), and biomarker-based data from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and Lifestyle study including 1131 participants who underwent cerebrospinal fluid measurements of AD-related amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau proteins. Cognitive impairment was determined by education-corrected performance on the China-Modified Mini-Mental State Examination. Annual exposures to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) were estimated at areas of residence. Exposures were aggregated as 2-year averages preceding enrollments using Cox proportional hazards or linear models.", "Long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 20 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) increased the risk of cognitive impairment (hazard ratio, 1.100; 95% CI: 1.026-1.180), and similar associations were observed from separate cross-sectional analyses. Exposures to O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> yielded elevated risk but with nonsignificant estimates. Individuals exposed to high PM<sub>2.5</sub> manifested increased amyloid burdens as reflected by cerebrospinal fluid-AD biomarkers. Moreover, PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure-associated decline in global cognition was partly explained by amyloid pathology as measured by cerebrospinal fluid-A\u03b2<sub>42</sub>/A\u03b2<sub>40</sub>, P-tau/A\u03b2<sub>42</sub>, and T-tau/A\u03b2<sub>42</sub>, with mediation proportions ranging from 16.95% to 21.64%.", "Long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> contributed to the development of cognitive decline, which may be partly explained by brain amyloid accumulation indicative of increased AD risk."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Society of Biological Psychiatry.
