In the reactor, the original formation rate of hydroxyl radical was 2.27 x 10(-7) mol L(-1)s(-1), which was about three times than that in the contrast reactor. Ozone was formed in gas-phase and was transferred into the liquid. The characteristic of mass transfer was better in the novel reactor than that in the contrast reactor, which caused much higher ozone concentration in liquid. The dissociation of hydrogen peroxide was more evident in the former, which promoted the formations of hydroxyl radical. The p-chlorophenol (4-CP) degradation was also enhanced. Most of the ozone transferred into the liquid and hydrogen peroxide generated by discharge could be utilized by the degradation process of 4-CP. About 97% 4-CP was removed in 36 min discharge in the novel reactor. Organic acids such as formic, acetic, oxalic, propanoic and maleic acid were generated and free chloride ions were released in the degradation process. With the formation of organic acid, the pH was decreased and the conductivity was increased."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China. bwenjuan@suda.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Wenjuan", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Xiangli", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Junwen", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3DLC36A01X", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorophenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18621482", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.05.156", "S0304-3894(08)00814-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
