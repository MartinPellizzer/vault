Behenyl oleate (BO), a representative tear film wax ester, was used to study the reaction with ozone at the air-water interface.", "Time-dependent changes in mean molecular area of BO monolayers were measured at different ozone concentrations and surface pressures. In addition, the effect of ascorbic acid on the reaction rate was determined. Reaction was followed using thin-layer chromatography and reaction products were identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Tear fluid samples from healthy subjects were analyzed with LC-MS for any ozonolysis reaction products.", "Behenyl oleate was found to undergo rapid ozonolysis at the air-water interface at normal indoor ozone concentrations. The reaction was observed as an initial expansion followed by a contraction of the film area. Ascorbic acid was found to decrease the rate of ozonolysis. Main reaction products were identified as behenyl 9-oxononanoate and behenyl 8-(5-octyl-1,2,4-trioxolan-3-yl)octanoate. Similar ozonolysis products were not detected in the tear fluid samples.", "At the air-water interface, unsaturated wax esters react readily with ozone in ambient air. However, no signs of ozonolysis products were found in the tear fluid. This is most likely due to the antioxidant systems present in tear fluid. Last, the results show that ozonolysis needs to be controlled in future surface chemistry studies on tear film lipids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Helsinki Eye Lab Ophthalmology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland."}], "LastName": "Paananen", "ForeName": "Riku O", "Initials": "RO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Helsinki Eye Lab Ophthalmology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland."}], "LastName": "Rantam\u00e4ki", "ForeName": "Antti H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Parshintsev", "ForeName": "Jevgeni", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Helsinki Eye Lab Ophthalmology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland."}], "LastName": "Holopainen", "ForeName": "Juha M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7703701", "ISSNLinking": "0146-0404"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysophospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Esters"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lysophospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tears"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26720456", "10.1167/iovs.15-18398", "2478947"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
