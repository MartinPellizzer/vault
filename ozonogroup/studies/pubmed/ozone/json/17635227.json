One hundred and eighty monoliths were extracted from a species-rich Geo-Montani-Nardetum pasture and exposed in a free-air O(3)-fumigation system to one of three concentrations of O(3) (ambient, 1.2 x ambient, 1.6 x ambient) and five concentrations of additional N. Above-ground biomass, proportion of functional groups and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were measured annually. After 3 yr of treatment, the vegetation responded to the N input with an increase in above-ground productivity and altered species composition, but without changes resulting from elevated O(3). N input > 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was sufficient to affect the composition of functional groups, with sedges benefiting over-proportionally. No interaction of O(3) x N was observed, except for NDVI; positive effects of N addition on canopy greenness were counteracted by accelerated leaf senescence in the highest O(3) treatment. The results suggest that effects of elevated O(3) on the productivity and floristic composition of subalpine grassland may develop slowly, regardless of the sensitive response to increasing N."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution and Climate Group, Agroscope Research Station ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassin", "ForeName": "Seraina", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution and Climate Group, Agroscope Research Station ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Volk", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suter", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Sciences, ETH Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buchmann", "ForeName": "Nina", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution and Climate Group, Agroscope Research Station ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuhrer", "ForeName": "J\u00fcrg", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Achermann B, Bobbink R. 2003.
