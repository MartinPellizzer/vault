These 42 patients included 33 children with 92 incisor teeth with a Vas score of > or = 30, and these 92 incisors were included in the second part of the study. The patients included in the second part were divided into three main groups and six subgroups. The main groups included the following: fluoride, CPP-ACP and CPP-ACP with fluoride. Each main group was divided into two subgroups: one with ozone use and one without ozone use.", "Girls exhibited significantly more sensitivity compared with boys (p < 0.05). There were significant decreases in hypersensitivity compared to baseline in all of the groups (p < 0.05). There were no differences among the groups at the end of the study (p > 0.05).", "The results of this study revealed that gender is an important factor in the sensitivity of teeth with MLH. Desensitizing agents effectively reduced the hypersensitivity of teeth with MIH. CPP-ACP paste was found to be more effective, and ozone therapy prolonged the effect of CPP-ACP paste."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozg\u00fcl", "ForeName": "Bet\u00fcl Memi\u015f", "Initials": "BM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saat", "ForeName": "Sinem", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00f6nmez", "ForeName": "Hayriye", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oz", "ForeName": "Firdevs Tulga", "Initials": "FT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Pediatr Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "9100079", "ISSNLinking": "1053-4628"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caseins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dentin Desensitizing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides, Topical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate nanocomplex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Caseins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel Hypoplasia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin Desensitizing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin Sensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Incisor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24683770"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
