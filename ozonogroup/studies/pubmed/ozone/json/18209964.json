Three hours later OSO (4, 12 and 24 mg/kg) and cimetidine 25 mg/kg were administered also by oral route. Four hours thereafter the rats were killed and the stomachs were removed for biochemical analysis and histological study.", "The gastric ulcer index was reduced by OSO and cimetidine. OSO also reduced TBARS concentration, but it increased SOD activity in gastric mucosa homogenates. In contrast, CAT activity was not significantly modified the treatment. Histological study confirmed the cytoprotective effects of OSO in rat gastric mucosa damaged by indomethacin.", "It was concluded that cytoprotective effects of OSO in rat gastric mucosa are mediated at least partially by upregulation of the antioxidant system and mainly SOD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biological Assays, Department of Biomedical Research, Ozone Research Center, Havana, Cuba. zullyt70@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zamora", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guanche", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merino", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Men\u00e9ndez", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alonso", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Inflamm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9508160", "ISSNLinking": "1023-3830"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sunflower Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunflower Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18209964", "10.1007/s00011-007-7034-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
