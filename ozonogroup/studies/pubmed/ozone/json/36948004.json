Although previous research has demonstrated the association between cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and air pollutants, evidence on the link between CMM and air pollution exposure among Chinese older adults is limited. To address this research gap, we conducted a national representative survey of 222,179 adults aged 60 and older to investigate the epidemiology of CMM and its association with long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in China's elderly population. We found that the prevalence of CMM among Chinese older adults was 16.9%, and hypertension and CCVD were the most common CMM cluster (10.8%). After adjusting for confounding variables, we observed a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and CCVD, with a respective excess risk increase of 3.2%, 3.6%, and 5.5% for every 10-unit increase. Moreover, every 10-unit increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> was linked to a higher risk of hypertension and diabetes (2.2%), hypertension and CCVD (5.4%), diabetes and CCVD (5.6%), and hypertension, diabetes, and CCVD combined (7.6%). We also found a U-shaped curve relationship between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and the occurrence of hypertension, diabetes, and CCVD, as well as different subtypes of CMM, with the lowest risk of O<sub>3</sub> exposure was observed near 75-80\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, we identified that female and rural residents are more vulnerable to the health risks of air pollution than male and urban residents. Given the increasing aging of the population and rising prevalence of multimorbidity, policymakers should focus more attention on the female and rural elderly population to prevent and control CMM. This study provides compelling evidence that reducing air pollution levels can be an effective strategy to prevent and manage CMM among older adults."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
