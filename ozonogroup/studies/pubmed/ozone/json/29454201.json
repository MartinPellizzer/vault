In these systems, fish are commonly grown at high density, 50 to 150kg/m<sup>3</sup>, using high-protein (30%-60%) feeds. Typically, the RAS consists of a solid treatment and a nitrification unit; in more advanced RAS, there is an additional denitrification step. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), a byproduct during nitrification and denitrification processes, is a potent greenhouse gas that destroys the ozone layer. The aim of this study was to measure and assess N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from a near-zero discharge land-based saline RAS. N<sub>2</sub>O flux was monitored from the RAS's fish tank, and moving-bed nitrification and activated-sludge (with intrinsic C source) denitrification reactors. N<sub>2</sub>O emission potential was also analyzed in the laboratory. N<sub>2</sub>O flux from the denitrification reactors ranged between 6.5 and 48mg/day, equivalent to 1.27\u00b11.01% of the removed nitrate-N. Direct analysis from the fish tank and nitrification reactors could not be performed due to high aeration, which diluted the N<sub>2</sub>O concentration to below detection limits. Thus, its potential emission was estimated in the laboratory: from the fishponds, it was negligible; from the nitrification reactor, it ranged between 0.4 and 2.8% of the total ammonia-N oxidized. The potential N<sub>2</sub>O emission from the denitrification reactor was 3.72\u00b12.75% of the reduced nitrate-N, within the range found in the direct measurement. Overall, N<sub>2</sub>O emission during N transformation in a RAS was evaluated to be 885mg/kg feed or 1.36g/kg fish production, accounting for 1.23% of total N application. Consequently, it is estimated that N<sub>2</sub>O emission from aquaculture currently accounts for 2.4% of the total agricultural N<sub>2</sub>O emission, but will decrease to 1.7% by 2030."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
