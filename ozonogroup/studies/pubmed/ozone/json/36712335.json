Observations during the COVID-19 lockdown in urban China show that the co-abatement of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) caused winter ground-level O<sub>3</sub> increases, but the chemical mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we report field observations in the Shanghai lockdown that reveals increasing photochemical formation of O<sub>3</sub> from VOC oxidation with decreasing NO<sub>x</sub>. Analyses of the VOC profiles and NO/NO<sub>2</sub> indicate that the O<sub>3</sub> increases by the NO<sub>x</sub> reduction counteracted the O<sub>3</sub> decreases through the VOC emission reduction in the VOC-limited region, and this may have been the main mechanism for this net O<sub>3</sub> increase. The mechanism may have involved accelerated OH-HO<sub>2</sub>-RO<sub>2</sub> radical cycling. The NO<sub>x</sub> reductions for increasing O<sub>3</sub> production could explain why O<sub>3</sub> increased from 2014 to 2020 in response to NO<sub>x</sub> emission reduction even as VOC emissions have essentially remained unchanged. Model simulations suggest that aggressive VOC abatement, particularly for alkenes and aromatics, should help reverse the long-term O<sub>3</sub> increase under current NO<sub>x</sub> abatement conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
