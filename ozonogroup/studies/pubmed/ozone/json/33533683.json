The efficiency of oxidative processes was monitored by combined approach based on determination of efficiency of wastewater treatment and impact to waste sludge stabilization. Degradation of Tiamulin in model wastewater (100\u2005mg\u2005L<sup>-1</sup>) during oxidation was followed by COD and DOC measurements while changes in biodegradability were determined by respirometric measurements. Biogas production potential was also determined to identify problems related to anaerobic digestion of waste sludge resulted in treatment of Tiamulin-contaminated wastewater. At ozone dose of 69 g<sub>ozone</sub> g<sub>COD</sub><sup>-1</sup> and 220 g<sub>ozone</sub> g<sub>DOC</sub><sup>-1</sup>removal for COD and DOC was 26% and 17%, respectively. Better biotreatability was confirmed by respirometric testing. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition did not improve removal efficiency (11-13%). The second stage of nitrification was suppressed by the addition of Tiamulin and ozonation again recovered <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><mstyle><mtext>-</mtext></mstyle><msubsup><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup></math> formation.

Simultaneously, quadratic model was developed to describe the relationship between oxygen uptake rate and changes in ammonium nitrogen concentration due to the oxidative treatment. The positive impact of ozone was also confirmed by ozonation of Tiamulin-contaminated (400\u2005mg\u2005L<sup>-1</sup>) waste sludge where biogas production potential was increased for 6-times. Combination of approaches confirmed, that O<sub>3</sub> effectively increase the treatability of Tiamulin in wastewater and sludge while addition of the hydrogen peroxide generally did not improve the performance of the processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "\u017dgajnar Gotvajn", "ForeName": "Andreja", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry and Food Technology, Department of Environmental Engineering, Slovak Technical University, Bratislava, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Derco", "ForeName": "J\u00e1n", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry and Food Technology, Department of Environmental Engineering, Slovak Technical University, Bratislava, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Vrabe\u013e", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Institute, Bratislava, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Kassai", "ForeName": "Angelika", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biofuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E38WZ4U54R", "NameOfSubstance": "tiamulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33533683", "10.1080/09593330.2021.1876776"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
