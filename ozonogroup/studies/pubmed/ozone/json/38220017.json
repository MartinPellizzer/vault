A systematic approach based on an interpretable machine learning (ML) model was utilized to evaluate the primary driving factors that impact O<sub>3</sub> and to elucidate how changes in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, VOCs from different sources, NO<sub>x</sub>, and meteorological conditions either promote or inhibit O<sub>3</sub> formation through their individual and synergistic effects in a tropical coastal city, Haikou, from 2019 to 2020. The results suggest that under low PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels, alongside the linear O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub> relationship observed, O<sub>3</sub> formation is suppressed by PM<sub>2.5</sub> with higher proportions of traffic-derived aerosol. Vehicle VOC emissions contributed maximally to O<sub>3</sub> formation at midday, despite the lowest concentration. VOCs from fossil fuel combustion and industry emissions, which have opposing effects on O<sub>3</sub>, act as inhibitors and promoters by inducing diverse photochemical regimes. As PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution escalates, the impact of these VOCs reverses, becoming more pronounced in shaping O<sub>3</sub> variation. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the O<sub>3</sub> formation regime is VOC-limited, and effective regional O<sub>3</sub> mitigation requires prioritizing substantial VOC reductions to offset enhanced VOC sensitivity induced by the co-reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, with a focus on industrial and vehicular emissions, and subsequently, fossil fuel combustion once PM<sub>2.5</sub> is effectively controlled. This study underscores the potential of the SHAP-based ML approach to decode the intricate O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub>x</sub>-VOCs-PM<sub>2.5</sub> interplay, considering both meteorological and atmospheric compositional variations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
