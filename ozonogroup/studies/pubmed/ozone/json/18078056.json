The integral and local glial indices K(g) and K(c) were calculated. Studies were conducted before, within 1 week and 1 and 2 months after a course of therapy. With ozone therapy, ERG and RERG depended on the specific features of changes available in the fundus of the eye before surgery. In the early rehabilitative period after surgery (circlage with subretinal fluid removal), ozone therapy normalized the glial indices, by decreasing the supernormal activity of Muller's glial cells and drastically increasing their reduced activity. The maximum effect was revealed for the function of phororeceptors (except for the eyes showing pronounced myopic dystrophic changes in the fundus). There were increases in MERG, ERG b-wave, and low-frequency RERG by 12 Hz, i.e. improved functions of the macular region and distal neurons of the retinal rod cell system. A latent period was established for the manifestation of a positive effect of ozonwe therapy on the functional of neurons of the internal retinal nuclear layer, as evidenced by RERG changes. Ozone therapy positively affect retinal electrogenesis in cases of total retinal detachment accompanied by a pronounced reduction in the glial index Kg before surgery. The therapy was found to have a positive impact on the functional activity of the retina of pair eyes, by developing within a one-moth latent period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neroev", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarygina", "ForeName": "O I", "Initials": "OI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zueva", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsapenko", "ForeName": "I V", "Initials": "IV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Egorova", "ForeName": "E N", "Initials": "EN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vestn Oftalmol", "NlmUniqueID": "0415216", "ISSNLinking": "0042-465X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electroretinography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Postoperative Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Retinal Detachment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18078056"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
