Based hourly observations at 23 sites in western China from June 2016 to May 2017, concentrations of most pollutants were higher outside the Tibetan Plateau, lowest in summer and highest in winter, the exception being O<sub>3</sub>. This was partially because meteorological conditions in winter were found to the most unfavorable to pollutant dispersion and dilution than other seasons. Pollutant concentrations at most sites were correlated with the residential emissions which were higher in winter, but anti-correlated with the industrial emissions which were lower during the winter holiday period. The Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations of four pollution control strategies indicated that reduction of residential emissions is crucial to alleviate PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and CO pollution in western China, although reduction of industrial and transport emissions can reduce SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Since PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were also found to be the species most and next frequently responsible for extremely serious pollution in western China, respectively, we recommend pollution control regulations that target residential emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
