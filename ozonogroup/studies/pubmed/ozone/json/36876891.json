However, its practical implementation is hindered by low conversion efficiency and emissions of noxious by-products. Herein, an advanced low-oxygen-pressure calcination process is developed to fine-tune the oxygen vacancy concentration of MOF-derived TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals. Vo-poor and Vo-rich TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts were placed in the back of an NTP reactor to convert harmful ozone molecules into ROS that decompose VOCs <i>via</i> heterogeneous catalytic ozonation processes. The results indicate that Vo-TiO<sub>2</sub>-5/NTP with the highest Vo concentration exhibited superior catalytic activity in the degradation of toluene compared to NTP-only and TiO<sub>2</sub>/NTP, achieving a maximum 96% elimination efficiency and 76% CO<sub><i>x</i></sub> selectivity at an SIE of 540 J L<sup>-1</sup>. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, \u02d9O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and \u02d9OH species derived from the activation of O<sub>3</sub> molecules on Vo sites contribute to the decomposition of toluene over the Vo-rich TiO<sub>2</sub> surface. With the aid of advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations, the roles of oxygen vacancies in manipulating the synergistic capability of post-NTP systems were explored, and were attributed to increased O<sub>3</sub> adsorption ability and enhanced charge transfer dynamics. This work presents novel insights into the design of high-efficiency NTP catalysts structured with active Vo sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China. ynsong@phy.ecnu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collage of Marine Science and Technology, Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, 316022, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wenjie", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Bu", "ForeName": "Saiyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4687-622X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China. ynsong@phy.ecnu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yuanting", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1924-2598"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China. ynsong@phy.ecnu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Institute of Advanced Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yenan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1471-8876"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Haitao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4747-3027"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Lab for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration, School of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Zhen", "ForeName": "Guangyin", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Life Science Major, Kyonggi University, Suwon, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Lunhua", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4683-2112"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Qinghong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China. ynsong@phy.ecnu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Chengbin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China. ynsong@phy.ecnu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Institute of Advanced Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhuo", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanoscale", "NlmUniqueID": "101525249", "ISSNLinking": "2040-3364"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36876891", "10.1039/d2nr04952j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
