All participants that were planned to have a combination of major and minor ozone AHT underwent a complete ocular examination and OCTA imaging before and after the ozone AHT. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) metrics and vessel density (VD) of superficial (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) plexus were assessed using the built-in software.", "A total of 40 right eyes of 40 individuals were included. No significant differences were observed for the mean values of the FAZ metrics and choriocapillaris flow area following ozone AHT compared with baseline values (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The mean whole VD of SCP and DCP was 47.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.18% and 53.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.00% before treatment, which decreased to 47.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7% and 52.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.07% after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.660 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.097, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the vascular densities of both SCP and DCP in any quadrant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The RPC density did not show significant alterations compared with baseline values, except the inferior-hemi region. The VD in the inferior-hemi peripapillary quadrant was significantly increased after ozone AHT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034).", "The ozone AHT did not cause evident RVR in the macular area, whereas the peripapillary area showed a partial response."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
