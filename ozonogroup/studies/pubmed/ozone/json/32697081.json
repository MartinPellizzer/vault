Both oxidants react with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and alter its composition, but the selectivity of the two oxidants and mechanisms of reactivity with DOM moieties are largely unknown. The reactions of O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH with two DOM isolates were studied by varying specific ozone doses (0.1-1.3 mg-O<sub>3</sub>/mg-C) at pH 7. Additionally, conditions that favor O<sub>3</sub> (i.e., addition of an <sup>\u2022</sup>OH scavenger) or <sup>\u2022</sup>OH (i.e., pH 11) were investigated. Ozonation decreases aromaticity, apparent molecular weight, and electron donating capacity (EDC) of DOM with large changes observed when O<sub>3</sub> is the main oxidant (e.g., EDC decreases 63-77% for 1.3 mg-O<sub>3</sub>/mg-C). Both O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH react with highly aromatic, reduced formulas detected using high-resolution mass spectrometry (O:C = 0.48 \u00b1 0.12; H:C = 1.06 \u00b1 0.23), while <sup>\u2022</sup>OH also oxidizes more saturated formulas (H:C = 1.64 \u00b1 0.26). Established reactions between model compounds and O<sub>3</sub> (e.g., addition of one to two oxygen atoms) or <sup>\u2022</sup>OH (e.g., addition of one oxygen atom and decarboxylation) are observed and produce highly oxidized DOM (O:C > 1.0). This study provides molecular-level evidence for the selectivity of O<sub>3</sub> as an oxidant within DOM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4285-7638"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Chemistry and Technology Program,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Remucal", "ForeName": "Christina K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag),8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Salhi", "ForeName": "Elisabeth", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag),8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Walpen", "ForeName": "Nicolas", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6852-8977"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag),8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32697081", "10.1021/acs.est.0c03052"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
