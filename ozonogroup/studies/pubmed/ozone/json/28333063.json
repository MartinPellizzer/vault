The STP in Shihezi was chosen as representative to investigate the distribution of antibiotics in a sludge-sewage system. Results showed that the concentrations of most detected antibiotics ranged from tens to hundreds of nanograms per liter in influent samples and under 100 ng L<sup>-1</sup> in effluent samples. QNs and TCs were dominant species with concentrations of 2.33 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 3.34 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.36 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.47 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in sludge samples, respectively. The elimination rates of target antibiotics by various STPs ranged from 17% to 100%. The STP with anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic and membrane bio-reactor technology removed antibiotics more efficiently than those with anaerobic/anoxic/oxic and oxidation ditch technology. The elimination capacities of treatment units from the three STPs were also investigated. SAs were mainly degraded in biological treatment units; conversely, QNs and TCs were significantly eliminated in sedimentary treatment units. Ozonation effectively removed remaining antibiotics but not UV and chlorination disinfection in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shihezi University, Key Laboratory for Green Processing of Chemical Engineering of Xinjiang Bingtuan, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, China E-mail: lujianjiang_xj@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shihezi University, Key Laboratory for Green Processing of Chemical Engineering of Xinjiang Bingtuan, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, China E-mail: lujianjiang_xj@163.com."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jianjiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shihezi University, Key Laboratory for Green Processing of Chemical Engineering of Xinjiang Bingtuan, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, China E-mail: lujianjiang_xj@163.com."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Yanbin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shihezi University, Key Laboratory for Green Processing of Chemical Engineering of Xinjiang Bingtuan, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, China E-mail: lujianjiang_xj@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28333063", "10.2166/wst.2017.013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
