Experiments with methylamine demonstrated that ozonation converts methylamine to nitromethane at \u223c100% yield. Subsequent chlorination converts nitromethane to chloropicrin at \u223c50% yield under the conditions evaluated. Similarly high yields from other primary amines were limited to those with functional groups on the \u03b2-carbon (e.g., the carboxylic acid in glycine) that facilitate carbon-carbon bond cleavage to release nitromethyl anion. Secondary amines featuring these reactive primary amines as functional groups (e.g., secondary N-methylamines) formed chloropicrin at high yields, likely by facile dealkylation to release the primary nitro compound. Chloropicrin yields from tertiary amines were low. Natural water experiments, including derivatization to transform primary and secondary amines to less reactive carbamate functional groups, indicated that primary and secondary amines were the dominant chloropicrin precursors during ozonation/chlorination. Ozonation followed by chlorination of the primary amine side chain of lysine demonstrated low yields (\u223c0.2%) of chloropicrin, but high yields (\u223c17%) of dichloronitrolysine, a halonitroalkane structural analogue to chloropicrin. However, chloropicrin yields increased and dichloronitrolysine yields decreased in the absence of hydroxyl radical scavengers, suggesting that future research should characterize the potential occurrence of such halonitroalkane analogues relative to natural radical scavenger (e.g., carbonate) concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "McCurry", "ForeName": "Daniel L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Quay", "ForeName": "Amanda N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Mitch", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitro Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroparaffins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BSF23SJ79E", "NameOfSubstance": "methylamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I4JTX7Z7U2", "NameOfSubstance": "chloropicrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RU5WG8C3F4", "NameOfSubstance": "nitromethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methylamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitro Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroparaffins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26752338", "10.1021/acs.est.5b04282"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
