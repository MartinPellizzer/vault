Tackling the synergistic reduction of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is critical to achieving improvements in clean air worldwide. A persistent issue is the identification of their common sources and integrated impacts under different environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of the pollution types captured by combined analysis through a comprehensive observational dataset for 2017-2020, and applied machine learning algorithms to quantify the effects of drivers on air pollutants and CO<sub>2</sub> formation. More importantly, detailed conclusions were drawn for the joint control of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> in multiple pollution types by using ensemble traceability technique. We demonstrated that reducing coal combustion emissions was an effective measure to maximize the benefits of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> in weather with low CO<sub>2</sub> levels and no PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution. Correspondingly, on days with severe PM<sub>2.5</sub> episodes, prioritizing control of vehicle emissions can simultaneously mitigate PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Similar conclusions were found at high CO<sub>2</sub> levels, accompanied by a more extensive role of vehicle emissions. Furthermore, a comparison of the differences in source impacts between PM<sub>2.5</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> and individual species suggests that focusing only on the sources that contribute significantly to one species may result in an underestimation or overestimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> source impacts. One such implication, as evidenced by our findings, is that synergistic controlling common sources of pollutants should be efficient. Thereby, common source management targeting PM<sub>2.5</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> under multiple pollution types is a more workable solution to alleviate environmental pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
