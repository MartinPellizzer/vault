Non-infectious risk factors such as short-term air pollution exposure may play a clinically important role. We sought to estimate the relationship between short-term air pollutant exposure and exacerbations in Canadian adults living with mild to moderate COPD.", "In this case-crossover study, exacerbations ('symptom based': \u226548\u2009hours of dyspnoea/sputum volume/purulence; 'event based': 'symptom based' plus requiring antibiotics/corticosteroids or healthcare use) were collected prospectively from 449 participants with spirometry-confirmed COPD within the Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease. Daily nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), composite of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>x</sub>), mean temperature and relative humidity estimates were obtained from national databases. Time-stratified sampling of hazard and control periods on day '0' (day-of-event) and Lags ('-1' to '-6') were compared by fitting generalised estimating equation models. All data were dichotomised into 'warm' (May-October) and 'cool' (November-April) seasons. ORs and 95% CIs were estimated per IQR increase in pollutant concentrations.", "Increased warm season ambient concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with symptom-based exacerbations on Lag-3 (1.14 (1.01 to 1.29), per IQR), and increased cool season ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with symptom-based exacerbations on Lag-1 (1.11 (1.03 to 1.20), per IQR). There was a negative association between warm season ambient O<sub>3</sub> and symptom-based events on Lag-3 (0.73 (0.52 to 1.00), per IQR).", "Short-term ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure were associated with increased odds of exacerbations in Canadians with mild to moderate COPD, further heightening the awareness of non-infectious triggers of COPD exacerbations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.
