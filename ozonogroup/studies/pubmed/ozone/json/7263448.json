In the present study, we examined the validity of effective dose in predicting pulmonary function impairment when effective dose was determined both as a simple product and as a weighted function via multiple regression. Eight trained male subjects (ages 22-46) completed 18 protocols, including exposures (via mouthpiece) to filtered air and three levels of O3 concentration (0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 ppm), while exercising continuously for durations ranging from 30 to 80 min. The O3 effective dose was significantly related to pulmonary function impairment and exercise ventilatory pattern alteration. Multiple regression analysis, however, substantiated the predominant importance of O3 concentration, with the threshold for O3 toxicity during exercise at a moderately heavy work load [approximately 65% maximum O2 uptake (VO2 max)] shown to be between 0.20 and 0.30 ppm. Although considerable individual variability in O3 toxicity response was noted, group mean responses in our continuous exercise mouthpiece exposures were similar to those previously observed with IE chamber exposures. Thus while the effective dose concept has notable deficiencies in predicting the individual degree of O3 toxicity, it remains a useful approach and warrants further investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savin", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christo", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7263448", "10.1152/jappl.1981.51.2.415"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
