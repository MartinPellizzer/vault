That study exposed humans to 0.4\u2009ppm and rats to 2\u2009ppm <sup>18</sup>O-labeled O<sub>3</sub> and found comparable incorporation of <sup>18</sup>O into bronchoalveolar lavage constituents. However, during O<sub>3</sub> exposure humans were exercising, which increased their ventilation rate five-fold, while rats were at rest. This resulted in similar O<sub>3</sub> tissue doses between the two species, and predominantly explained the comparable <sup>18</sup>O incorporation at five-fold different concentrations. The five-times higher exercising human inhalation rate offset the five-times lower concentration, producing the same human dose expected at rest at 2\u2009ppm (i.e. 0.4\u2009ppm \u00d7\u20094686\u2009L/2\u2009hour\u00a0\u2248\u20092\u2009ppm\u2009\u00d7\u2009998\u2009L/2\u2009hour). In 2013, Hatch et\u00a0al. showed that resting humans and resting rats experienced fairly comparable <sup>18</sup>O incorporation at the same O<sub>3</sub> exposure concentration and activity state into BALF cells. Despite these findings, we show here that in the peer-reviewed literature a substantial proportion of researchers continue to perpetuate the misunderstanding that human lung tissue doses of O<sub>3</sub> are simply 3-5 times greater than rat doses at the same O<sub>3</sub> concentration, due to interspecies differences, and not considering activity state. It is important to correct this misconception to ensure an appropriate understanding of the implications of O<sub>3</sub> studies by the scientific community and policy experts making regulatory decisions (e.g. the US Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards for O<sub>3</sub>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicology Division , Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , Austin , TX , USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5282-507X"], "LastName": "McCant", "ForeName": "Darrell", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicology Division , Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , Austin , TX , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lange", "ForeName": "Sabine", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicology Division , Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , Austin , TX , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haney", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicology Division , Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , Austin , TX , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Honeycutt", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28697635", "10.1080/08958378.2017.1323982"]}}]}
