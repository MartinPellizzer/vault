The PCR generates in situ hydroiodic (HI) acid from the excess of potassium iodate that combines with bromate from the column effluent to form the triiodide anion detectable by UV/Vis absorbance at 352 nm. The suppressed conductivity cell current was optimized at 70 mA, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a 9 mM carbonate eluent. Its performance was investigated on a trace-level determination of bromate in ozonated municipal and bottled drinking water. Based on ozonated municipal drinking water matrix, the method detection limit of 0.27 \u03bcg BrO(-)(3)/L was evaluated with the Method Quantification Limit (MQL) of 0.89 \u03bcg BrO(-)(3)/L. However, in ultrapure water, a MDL of 0.015 \u03bcg BrO(-)(3)/L and a MRL of 0.052 \u03bcg BrO(-)(3)/L were achieved. The recovery for spiked municipal samples was in the range of 90%-115%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geological and Mining (CGM) Department, NSERC Industrial Chair on Drinking Water, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal,Civil, Montreal, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fotsing", "ForeName": "Marcellin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barbeau", "ForeName": "Benoit", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prevost", "ForeName": "Michele", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "694C0EFT9Q", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroiodic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21391036", "10.1080/10934529.2011.542401", "934592663"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
