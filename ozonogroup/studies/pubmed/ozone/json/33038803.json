Ozonation did not change main compositions and damaged starch content of three kernels' flours. Flour brightness of all three kernels was improved after ozone treatment. Ozonation enhanced the dough strength of the flours from un-pearled and pearled kernels and the effect elevated with increasing pearling degree. Ozone treatment increased the peak viscosity of flour and the level of increase in heavily-pearled kernels was greater than un-pearled and lightly-pearled. Ozonation resulted in an increase in the insoluble protein polymer content of heavily-pearled kernels' flour, but only had a slight effect on un-pearled lightly-pearled kernels. After ozone treatment, un-pearled and lightly-pearled kernels exhibited increases in molecular weight of starch, but heavily-pearled resulted in the opposite trend."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
