The gas-phase PAH and OH radical concentrations maximized at noon. Gas-phase PAH concentrations were correlated (p < 0.001) with ambient temperatures. The gas-phase OH-radical-initiated PAH reaction was identified as the major process contributing to the ambient burden of nitro-PAHs. 2-Nitrofluoranthene and 2-nitropyrene were the most abundant particle-associated nitro-PAHs. A well-defined diurnal pattern was identified for both compounds exhibiting a maximum during midday followed by a rapid decrease. 9,10-Anthracenodione and 9-fluorenone, the most abundant oxy-PAHs, did not present a diurnal variation of concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Chemical Processes Laboratory (ECPL), Department of Chemistry, University of Crete, EL-71003 Voutes-Heraklion, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsapakis", "ForeName": "Manolis", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stephanou", "ForeName": "Euripides G", "Initials": "EG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Islands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18186330", "10.1021/es071160e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
