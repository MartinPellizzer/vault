Analyzing data from 2020 and 2021, the research found notable correlations: COVID-19 cases in Cheras were positively associated with relative humidity (RH) and carbon monoxide (CO) but negatively with ozone (O\u2083) and RH in different years. In Kelapa Gading, COVID-19 cases were positively correlated with pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) and CO, while ambient temperature (AT) showed a negative correlation. The enforcement of social restrictions notably reduced air pollution, affecting COVID-19 spread. Predictive models for PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels using robust regression techniques showed strong performance in Kuala Lumpur (R\u00b2 > 0.9) but exhibited overfitting tendencies in Jakarta, suggesting the need for a longer study period for more accurate results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salsabila", "ForeName": "Norin Binta", "Initials": "NB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7910-6945"], "LastName": "Jalaludin", "ForeName": "Juliana", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5923-8713"], "LastName": "Suhaimi", "ForeName": "Nur Faseeha", "Initials": "NF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Ocean Engineering Technology, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Kuala Nerus, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3714-5356"], "LastName": "Wan Mansor", "ForeName": "Wan Nurdiyana", "Initials": "WN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Study Program of Public Health, Health Science Faculty, State Islamic University (UIN), Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, Indonesia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sumantri", "ForeName": "Arif", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39135511", "10.1080/09603123.2024.2390479"]}}]}
