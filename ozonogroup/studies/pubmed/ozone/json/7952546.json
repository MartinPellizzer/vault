A cohort of approximately 300 elementary school children in each of six communities were asked to keep a daily log of the study child's respiratory symptoms for one year. Daily measurements of ambient sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, inhalable particles (PM10), respirable particles (PM2.5), light scattering, and sulfate particles were made, along with integrated 24-h measures of aerosol strong acidity. The analyses were limited to the five warm season months between April and August. Significant associations were found between incidence of coughing symptoms and incidence of lower respiratory symptoms and PM10, and a marginally significant association between upper respiratory symptoms and PM10. There was no evidence that other measures of particulate pollution including aerosol acidity were preferable to PM10 in predicting incidence of respiratory symptoms. Significant associations in single pollutant models were also found between sulfur dioxide or ozone and incidence of cough, and between sulfur dioxide and incidence of lower respiratory symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dockery", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neas", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wypij", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ware", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spengler", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Speizer", "ForeName": "F E", "Initials": "FE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferris", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-0002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-01108", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7952546", "10.1164/ajrccm.150.5.7952546"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
