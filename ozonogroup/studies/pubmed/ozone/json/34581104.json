The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality(TCEQ) method and principal component analysis(PCA) were used to study the contribution of regional background and local O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the industrial zone, the results of which were compared. The results indicated that:\u2460 During the observation period, the dominant wind directions in the park were southeast and east, and the average temperature was 27.12\u2103. The daily average <i>\u03c1</i>(VOCs-36), <i>\u03c1</i>(NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>), and <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>) was 32.05-240.51, 10.15-47.51, and 31.81-144.43\u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Alkanes are the most abundant of 36 VOCs; \u2461 The regional background concentrations based on the TCEQ method ranged from 32.63 to 191.13\u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the local concentrations ranged from 16.08 to 134.25 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The percentage contribution of the regional background ranged from 32.6% to 87.7%. The PCA analysis showed that the regional background concentrations ranged from 66.3 to 219.83\u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>; \u2462 The variations in local O<sub>3</sub> concentrations based on the TCEQ analysis broadly correspond to the variations in ozone formation potential in the park. The two analysis methods were consistent, verifying that the results are reliable; and \u2463 After eliminating the calculation error caused by the abnormal concentrations recorded at some stations, the proportion of background O<sub>3</sub> in the region was generally within the range 75%-95% during the observation period. Overall, regional transport was the main source of O<sub>3</sub> in the industrial park, and O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the surrounding cities should be the focus of pollution control alongside joint prevention and control measures in the Yangtze River Delta region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Protection Key Laboratory on Environmental Standard and Risk Management of Chemical Pollutants, School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Risk Assessment and Control on Chemical Process, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Protection Key Laboratory on Environmental Standard and Risk Management of Chemical Pollutants, School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Risk Assessment and Control on Chemical Process, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yin-Zhi", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Protection Key Laboratory on Environmental Standard and Risk Management of Chemical Pollutants, School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Risk Assessment and Control on Chemical Process, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Xiu", "ForeName": "Guang-Li", "Initials": "GL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581104", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202101199"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
