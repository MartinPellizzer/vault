Many works reported the progress in active MnO<sub>2</sub> synthesis, but the active phase is rarely systematically studied. In this paper, all six phases of MnO<sub>2</sub> (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4-, \u03b3-, \u03bb- and \u03b5-) were synthesized by facile methods. Their catalytic activities in ozonation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) were evaluated and correlated with the physicochemical properties obtained from X-ray Diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), physical adsorption and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. \u03b1- MnO<sub>2</sub> was found to be the most active catalyst in 4-NP degradation at neutral pH. MnO<sub>2</sub> with low average oxidation state (AOS) showed stronger oxidation/reduction peaks in CV characterization, which benefited catalytic decomposition of ozone to generate active species. Superoxide radical was confirmed as the main oxidizing species, along with singlet oxygen and ozone molecule oxidation in bulk solution and little contribution of oxidation on the MnO<sub>2</sub> surface. Mn<sup>2+</sup> leaching happened during catalytic ozonation, but its catalytic role is negligible. This result may give rise to the preparation of new active MnO<sub>2</sub> catalysts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
