In this sense, developing a robust and easy-recovered magnetic nanocomposite with eminent photocatalytic activity is very imperative for detoxifying pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, a systematic study was conducted to investigate the photocatalytic ozonation for eliminating metronidazole (MET) from aqueous media utilizing the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO heterojunction under simulated sunlight irradiation. The composite material was fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method and diagnosed by multiple advanced analytical techniques. Modelling and optimization of MET decontamination by adopting the central composite design (CCD) revealed that 90 % of MET decontamination can be achieved within 120\u00a0min of operating time at the optimized circumstance (photocatalyst dose: 1.17\u00a0g/L, MET dose: 33.20\u00a0mg/L, ozone concentration: 3.99\u00a0mg/min and pH: 8.99). In an attempt to scrutinize the practical application of the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO/xenon/O<sub>3</sub> system, roughly 56.18% TOC and 73% COD were removed under the optimized operational circumstances during 120\u00a0min of degradation time. According to the radical quenching experiments, hydroxyl radicals (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>) were the major oxidative species responsible for the elimination of MET. The MET degradation rate maintained at 83% after seven consecutive runs, manifesting the efficiency of CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO material in the MET removal. Ultimately, the photocatalytic ozonation mechanism over the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO heterojunction of the fabricated nanocomposites was rationally proposed for MET elimination. In extension, the results drawn in this work indicate that integrating photocatalyst and ozonation processes by the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO material can be applied as an efficient and promising method to eliminate tenacious and non-biodegradable contaminants from aqueous environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
