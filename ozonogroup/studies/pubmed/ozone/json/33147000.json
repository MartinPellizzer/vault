However, the evolution of THS in indoor environments is not well understood. Cannabis THS is a chemically distinct and prevalent form of THS, which has not been studied. The heterogeneous reaction of \u0394<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a major component of cannabis smoke, with ozone was examined as a pure compound and within cannabis smoke. Oxidative decay via ozonolysis and product formation were monitored by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Epoxide, dicarbonyl, and secondary ozonide THC reaction products were detected from both pure THC and cannabis experiments, with the product ratios dependent on relative humidity. The observed reaction kinetics for loss of THC on glass and cotton surfaces are consistent with a relatively short loss lifetime, which will be strongly dependent on the film thickness, ozone mixing ratio, and ozone reactivity of the surface substrate. The low volatility of THC and its oxidation products suggest that their contributions to thirdhand cannabis smoke will be less significant than the role that nicotine plays in thirdhand tobacco smoke."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5721-514X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wylie", "ForeName": "Aaron D L", "Initials": "ADL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3372-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7J8897W37S", "NameOfSubstance": "Dronabinol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dronabinol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33147000", "10.1021/acs.est.0c03728"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
