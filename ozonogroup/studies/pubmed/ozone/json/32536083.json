Investigated and analyzed the types of occupational hazards, workplace distribution and occupational disease prevention facilities and the concentration (intensity) of major types of work and workplace occupational hazards were also improved Line detection and analysis. <b>Results:</b> Silica dust could be seen in slag tank, slag sorting and crusher operation position. The concentration of silica dust in each workplace fluctuates within 0.3-1.1 mg/m(3). Both the concentration of silica dust in the workplace and the time weighted average allowable concentration (C-TWA) of dust exposure of dust exposed workers were detected, but none of them exceeds the requirements of the national occupational exposure limit. Carbon monoxide, ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, non methane total hydrocarbon, formaldehyde, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen cyanide, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and ozone were detected, but all meet the requirements of national occupational exposure limit. The 8-hour equivalent a sound level (L(ex\u00b78h)) over 85 dB (A) mainly includes boiler, steam turbine, electrical inspector and auxiliary value of water treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> The occupational hazards of waste incineration power generation enterprises are serious.
