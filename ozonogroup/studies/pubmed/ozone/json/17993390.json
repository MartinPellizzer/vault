Escherichia coli O157:H7 transmission from the rind to edible melon flesh during cutting practices was also investigated. Four different treatments consisting of hot water (75 degrees C, 1min), gaseous ozone (10,000ppm, 30min), gaseous ozone supplied by carbon monoxide gas and the combination of hot water and gaseous ozone were evaluated. Sensory quality and growth evolution of aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, coliforms and molds were studied. In general, hot water, gaseous ozone, and the combination of hot water and gaseous ozone were effective in reducing total microbial population. The combination of hot water and gaseous ozone was the most effective treatment to control microbial growth achieving 3.8, 5.1, 2.2 and 2.3log reductions for mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, molds and coliforms, respectively. However no significant differences were observed between gaseous ozone and gaseous ozone supplied by with carbon monoxide gas. There was no evidence of damage in melons treated with hot water, ozone or their combination and they maintained initial texture and aroma. Therefore, the combination of hot water and gaseous ozone may be an efficient and promising treatment for controlling microbial growth and maintaining sensory quality of melons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Vegetable Crops, University of California, Davis, CA 95616-863, USA. cta004@cebas.csic.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selma", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "Ana M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allende", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cantwell", "ForeName": "Marita", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suslow", "ForeName": "Trevor", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8601127", "ISSNLinking": "0740-0020"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis melo"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sanitation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17993390", "10.1016/j.fm.2007.06.003", "S0740-0020(07)00079-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
