A panel study was conducted to clarify the effects of air pollution on respiratory symptoms and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in outpatients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Korea.", "Patients filled out a questionnaire including self-reported HR-QoL in February and were followed up in May and July. The study was conducted from 2013 to 2015, with different participants each year. Air quality parameters were applied in a generalized estimating equation as independent variables to predict factors affecting HR-QoL.", "Lower physical fitness scores were associated with Asian sand dust events. Daily activity scores were worse when there were high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) less than 10 \u03bcm in diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>). Lower social functioning scores were associated with high PM less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations. High NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations also showed a significant association with mental health scores. Weather-related cough was prevalent when PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, or ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations were high, regardless of COPD severity. High PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations were associated with worsened wheezing, particularly in COPD patients.", "The results suggest that PM, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> cause respiratory symptoms leading to HR-QoL deterioration. While some adverse effects of air pollution appeared to occur regardless of COPD, others occurred more often and more intensely in COPD patients. The public sector, therefore, needs to consider tailoring air pollution countermeasures to people with different conditions to minimize adverse health effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakao", "ForeName": "Motoyuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3269-0803"], "LastName": "Ishihara", "ForeName": "Yoko", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Respiratory Health Center, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hwaseong, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Cheol-Hong", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Respiratory Health Center, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hwaseong, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyun", "ForeName": "In-Gyu", "Initials": "IG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Prev Med Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101242972", "ISSNLinking": "1975-8375"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Prev Med Public Health. 2018 Jul;51(4):215-216. doi: 10.3961/jpmph.18.114", "PMID": "30071710"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Outpatients"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Report"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</b>.
