Additionally, the removal efficiency of organic pollutants from BCW, the deactivation mechanism of Mn<sub>x</sub>Ce<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and backflushing optimization for in-situ catalyst regeneration, which have not been previously investigated, were analysed. Results of the 12-month pilot scale experiments showed that catalytic ozonation resulted in the effective removal of organic pollutants when backflushing was applied as an in-situ catalyst regeneration strategy. The effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) content decreased from 150 to 78\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and remained below a discharge limitation of 80\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and the stable COD removal efficiencies (from 56.0% to 47.9%) indicated that catalyst deactivation, which primarily resulted from the deposition of inorganic salts on the surface of the catalyst that limited interaction between ozone and active sites and/or prevented electrons transfer, was primarily inhibited by backflushing. The catalyst regeneration via in-situ air- and water-backflushing was attributed to the scrubbing, collision, and/or the loosing effect. Additionally, in the full-scale experiment, the catalytic ozonation process with in-situ alternative backflushing exhibited a stable COD removal efficiency (above 45.6%) for 885 days when water- and air-flushing strengths of 10\u00a0L\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and 15\u00a0L\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, were applied with a 7-day regeneration interval. Therefore, the results of this study provide new insights into catalytic ozonation and support its engineering application in BCW treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
