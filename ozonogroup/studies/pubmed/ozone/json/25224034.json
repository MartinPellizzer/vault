The aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms of impairment of both the molecular structure and the spatial organization of fibrinogen under ozone-induced oxidation. FTIR analysis showed that ozone treatment of the whole fibrinogen molecule results in the growth of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl group content. A similar analysis of fibrinogen D and E fragments isolated from the oxidized protein also revealed transformation of distinct important functional groups. In particular, a remarkable decay of N-H groups within the peptide backbone was observed along with a lowering of the content of C-H groups belonging to either the aromatic moieties or the aliphatic chain CH2 and CH3 units. The model experiments performed showed that the rather unexpected decay of the aliphatic CH units might be caused by the action of hydroxyl radicals, these being produced in the water solution from ozone. The observed dissimilarities in the shapes of amide I bands of the fibrinogen D and E fragments before and after ozone treatment are interpreted in terms of feasible local conformational changes affecting the secondary structure of the protein. Taken as a whole, the FTIR data suggests that the terminal D fragments of fibrinogen are markedly more susceptible to the ozone-induced oxidation than the central E fragment. The data on elastic and dynamic light scattering provide evidence that, in the presence of FXIIIa, both the unoxidized and the oxidized fibrinogen molecules bind to one another in an \"end-to-end\" fashion to form the flexible covalently cross-linked fibrinogen homopolymers. The \u03b3 and \u03b1 polypeptide chains of the oxidized fibrinogen proved to be involved in the enzymatic cross-linking more readily than those of unaffected fibrinogen. The experimental data on fibrinogen oxidation acquired in the present study, combined with our earlier findings, make it reasonable to suppose that the spatial structure of fibrinogen could be evolutionarily adapted to some reactive oxygen species actions detrimental to the protein function."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.
