Although ozone has been used for chemical cleaning of ceramic membranes, it is still unclear about the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) generated during on-line chemical cleaning with ozone in the development of membrane fouling in ceramic MBR. This study clearly revealed that the released DOM could considerably induce irreversible membrane fouling, and humic acid like-substances (HAL) with molecular weight (MW) of about 500\u202fDa were mainly responsible for the observed membrane fouling. A strong positive relationship existed between the membrane fouling rate of supernatant and the rejection level of HAL, evidenced by a high correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.99. Meanwhile, the results also showed that biopolymers with MW greater than 10\u202fkDa were easily rejected by the ceramic membranes used, leading to the development of membrane fouling. However, the high ozone concentration helped to reduce the generation of biopolymers. The organic fractions with MW less than 500\u202fDa in the DOM (e.g. building blocks, low-MW acid and low-MW neutrals) could pass through the ceramic membranes used, i.e. their contributions to the observed membrane fouling could be considered insignificant. Consequently, it appeared from this study that membrane fouling associated with the DOM generated by ozone during on-line chemical cleaning should not be ignored in the design and operation of ceramic MBR towards long-term process sustainability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
