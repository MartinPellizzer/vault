The subjects were divided into two groups, A (n = 8) and B (n = 6). Thirty minutes of exercise at 40% Vo2 max was performed from 60 to 90 min for group A and 30 to 60 min for group B. Pulmonary function changes, determined throughout exposure, were greatest immediately after exercise in both groups. Few changes occurred before the exercise period. However, the decrease in FVC (826 ml) and FEV1.0 (937 ml) following exercise was more than twice as large as the decrement seen at end exosure (388 and 423 ml, respectively). Measures of maximum expiratory flow (FEF 25-75%, FEF 50% FEF 75%) showed similar reductions. In many cases, reversal of these changes occurred during the remainder of the exposure period. The greatest decrease in FVC occurred when heat and ozone exposures were combined (WBGT = 92.0 degrees F). We conclude that the effects of ozone are most severe immediately after exercise and that heat stress may modify the overall effect of ozone on pulmonary function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horvath", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raven", "ForeName": "P B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bedi", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morton", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drinkwater", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bolduan", "ForeName": "N W", "Initials": "NW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gliner", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Residual Capacity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["914710", "10.1152/jappl.1977.43.3.409"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
