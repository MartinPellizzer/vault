Because individuals vary considerably in the magnitude of their responses to ozone exposure, it is difficult to estimate the number of individuals in a given population who are experiencing adverse effects. Consequently risk and benefits analysis for various regulatory scenarios cannot be carried out with precision. As an aid to risk assessment this paper presents a method of predicting the proportion of individuals in the population who experience a particular health effect. Risk equations predicting the proportion of individuals experiencing lung function decrements as a function of ozone concentration, duration of exposure, and age are presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonnell", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9612020", "ISSNLinking": "1382-6689"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21781722", "10.1016/S1382-6689(96)00050-6", "S1382-6689(96)00050-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
