The results showed that:\u2460 In the past five years, the air quality in Shandong province has shown an overall improvement trend. Except for ozone, the concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> decreased annually. Additionally, their distribution had obvious spatial differences, which was reflected in the lower concentration of air pollutants in coastal areas. \u2461 PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Shandong province had an extremely significant positive correlation with population density and the proportion of secondary industry (<i>P</i><0.01) but had a very negative correlation with urbanization rate (<i>P</i><0.01). Moreover, there were scale differences in the spatial relationship. The spatial relationship between population density, civil vehicle volume, industrial power consumption, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> was relatively stable, whereas the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of urbanization rate and the proportion of secondary industry on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was high. \u2462 Meteorological factors had different effects on PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Heze and Weihai. PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Heze had a stronger correlation with air temperature, relative humidity, and sunshine hours, whereas sea land breeze prevailed in Weihai, resulting in a higher correlation between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and wind speed. \u2463 Wavelet analysis showed that the frequency of air pollution in Heze was higher than that in Weihai, approximately one-two weeks/time in winter. In the annual cycle, the PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Heze lagged behind the wind speed, whereas the PM<sub>2.5</sub> and wind speed in Weihai were in the same phase. To summarize, there were obvious temporal and spatial differences in air quality in Shandong province, which was comprehensively affected by socio-economic and meteorological factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Surface Pattern and Simulation, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Meng-Ge", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Surface Pattern and Simulation, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Centre, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Centre, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng-Ying", "Initials": "FY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Land Surface Pattern and Simulation, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35686763", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202109020"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
