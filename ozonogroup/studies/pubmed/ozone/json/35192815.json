In particular, mechanochemical methodologies for preparation of reagents and catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants are reviewed and discussed, focusing on those materials that, directly or indirectly, induce redox reactions in the contaminants (i.e., photo-, persulfate-, ozone-, and Fenton-catalysts, as well as redox reagents). Methods reported in the literature include surface reactivity enhancement for single-component materials, as well as multi-component material design to obtain synergistic effects in catalytic efficiency and/or reactivity. It was also amply demonstrated that mechanochemical surface activation or the incorporation of catalytic/reactive components boost the generation of reactive species in water by accelerating charge transfer, increasing superficial active sites, and developing pollutant absorption. Finally, indications for potential future developments in this field are debated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
