We tested the hypothesis that the suitability of plant foliage to insect herbivores might be reduced due to higher amount of defence compounds produced by the host plant when exposed to enhanced UV-B radiation. Strawberry plants were exposed to supplementary UV-B and UV-A radiation in an open-field exposure system. The test animal was the leaf beetle (Galerucella sagittariae, Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), which is known to damage strawberry leaves both in larval and adult stage. The tentative first-year results reported in this paper showed slight, but not statistically significant support for this hypothesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, Finland. jarmo.holopainen@uku.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holopainen", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suoninen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Circumpolar Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9713056", "ISSNLinking": "1239-9736"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Finland"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10850003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
