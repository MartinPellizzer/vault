The molecular mechanisms of ozone-induced cell injury, as well as protective mechanisms against ozone-injury, are not well understood. Since ozone is a reactive oxidant, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an antioxidant enzyme induced by many oxidative stimuli, we hypothesized that HO-1 is one of the protective mechanisms against ozone-induced cell injury, as well as pulmonary inflammation. In the current study, C57Bl/6 mice were pretreated with a low level of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) (0.5 mg/kg) to induce HO-1, and 16 h later were exposed to 1 ppm ozone for 3 h. Endotoxin pretreatment caused a significant protection against ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation and cell injury in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The protection by endotoxin pretreatment against ozone-induced inflammation and necrosis in BAL cells was abolished by the cotreatment with a heme oxygenase inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX dichloride (SnPP), suggesting that HO-1 is responsible for the protection against ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation and BAL cell necrosis. Therefore, since HO-1 is induced following ozone exposure, HO-1 may contribute to the development of cellular adaptation to chronic ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Toxicology Program, University of Texas Houston Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamilton", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holian", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES08752", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Hmox1 protein, mouse"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11203434", "10.1080/08958370050198557"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
