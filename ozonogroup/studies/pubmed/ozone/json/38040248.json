Though styrene and isoprene coexist in the ambient atmosphere as important anthropogenic and biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors, respectively, their cross-reactions have not received attention. This study investigated the interactions of SCIs from styrene and isoprene ozonolysis for the first time. The high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used to determine the unique ion mass spectra of the isoprene-styrene-O<sub>3</sub> mixture. The results show that the signal intensities of new ions account for >8.4% of total ions in the mass spectra of the styrene-isoprene-O<sub>3</sub> mixed system. Styrene and isoprene ozonolysis can produce characteristic C<sub>7</sub>-SCI and C<sub>4</sub>-SCI, respectively. C<sub>7</sub>-SCI and C<sub>4</sub>-SCI can be involved in the cross-reactions, and the results of tandem mass spectra directly confirmed both C<sub>7</sub>-SCI and C<sub>4</sub>-SCI as chain units. The O/C and H/C ratios of cross-products are in the range of 0.38-1.07 and 1.00-1.50, respectively, which are consistent with cross-reaction products. Adding a C<sub>7</sub>-SCI unit reduces the oligomer's volatility by 1.3-1.4 orders of magnitude lower than adding a C<sub>4</sub>-SCI unit. Thus, C<sub>4</sub>-SCI can compete with C<sub>7</sub>-SCI to react with styrene-derived RO<sub>2</sub>/RC(O)OH to produce more volatile cross-products, while the less volatile cross-products can be formed when isoprene-derived RO<sub>2</sub>/RC(O)OH reacted with C<sub>7</sub>-SCI instead of C<sub>4</sub>-SCI. The SOA yield of the mixed system is lower than that of the single styrene-O<sub>3</sub> system but higher than that of the single isoprene-O<sub>3</sub> system. Ambient particles were also collected, and 5 possible SCI-related cross-products were identified. This study illustrates the effects of SCI-related cross-reactions on SOA components and physicochemical properties, providing a basis for future research on SCI-related cross-reactions that frequently occur in the ambient atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
