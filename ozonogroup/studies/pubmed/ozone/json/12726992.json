Ozone-sensitive plants of tobacco (cultivar Bel W3) in contrast to ozone-tolerant Bel B, are not able to increase their endogenous thylakoid membrane-bound putrescine when they are exposed to an atmosphere with enhanced ozone concentration, resulting in reduction of their photosynthetic rates and consequently reduction in plant biomass formation. In comparison to the tolerant cultivar Bel B, a prolongation of ozone exposure thus can lead to typical visible symptoms (necrotic spots) in leaves of the sensitive plant. Exogenously manipulated increase of the cellular putrescine levels of the ozone-sensitive Bel W3 is sufficient to revert these effects, whereas a reduction in endogenous putrescine levels of the tolerant cultivar Bel B renders them sensitive to ozone treatment. The results of this work reveal a regulator role for polyamines in adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus and consequently to its protection in an environment polluted by ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Crete, PO Box 2208, 71409 Heraklion, Crete, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Navakoudis", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fctz", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Langebartels", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fctz-Meindl", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotzabasis", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biogenic Polyamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "13123-70-1", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-diaminobutanone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V10TVZ52E4", "NameOfSubstance": "Putrescine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Biogenic Polyamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Putrescine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12726992", "10.1016/s0304-4165(03)00056-4", "S0304416503000564"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
