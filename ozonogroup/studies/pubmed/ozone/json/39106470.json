This study examines the gas-phase reactions of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) with five methyl-butenols (2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, 2-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, and 3-methyl-3-buten-2-ol) under atmospheric conditions at a temperature of (298 \u00b1 2) K and pressure of (1000 \u00b1 10) mbar. The experimental values for the gas-phase reaction rate coefficients obtained in this study, by using the relative rate method, are as follows (in cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>): k(3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol + O<sub>3</sub>) = (311 \u00b1 20) \u00d7 10<sup>-18</sup>, <i>k</i>(2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol + O<sub>3</sub>) = (9.55 \u00b1 1.04) \u00d7 10<sup>-18</sup>, <i>k</i>(3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol + O<sub>3</sub>) = (7.29 \u00b1 0.46) \u00d7 10<sup>-18</sup>, <i>k</i>(2-methyl-3-buten-1-ol + O<sub>3</sub>) = (4.25 \u00b1 0.29) \u00d7 10<sup>-18</sup>, and <i>k</i>(3-methyl-3-buten-2-ol + O<sub>3</sub>) = (62.9 \u00b1 6.8) \u00d7 10<sup>-18</sup>. The results are discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on the degree and type of substitutions of the double bond. The determined rate coefficient values are also compared to the available literature data and with estimates of the structure-activity relationship. Additionally, the atmospheric implications toward the tropospheric lifetime and photochemical ozone generation potential for the investigated compounds are provided, which highlight the atmospheric impact of methyl-butenol decomposition into the lower atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rusu Vasilache", "ForeName": "Ana-Maria", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrated Centre of Environmental Science Studies in the North Eastern Region (CERNESIM), \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center with Integrated Techniques for Atmospheric Aerosol Investigation in Romania (RECENT AIR), \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2249-7962"], "LastName": "Roman", "ForeName": "Claudiu", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrated Centre of Environmental Science Studies in the North Eastern Region (CERNESIM), \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bejan", "ForeName": "Iustinian G", "Initials": "IG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrated Centre of Environmental Science Studies in the North Eastern Region (CERNESIM), \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center with Integrated Techniques for Atmospheric Aerosol Investigation in Romania (RECENT AIR), \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arsene", "ForeName": "Cecilia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrated Centre of Environmental Science Studies in the North Eastern Region (CERNESIM), \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center with Integrated Techniques for Atmospheric Aerosol Investigation in Romania (RECENT AIR), \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" University of Iasi, 11 Carol I, 700506 Iasi, Romania."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1187-5526"], "LastName": "Olariu", "ForeName": "Romeo I", "Initials": "RI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39106470", "10.1021/acs.jpca.4c03653"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
