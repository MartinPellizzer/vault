Many consumers are shifting their dietary habits toward consuming more plant-based foods, such as plant milk analogs (PMA) for health, sustainability, and well-being reasons. The PMA market is anticipated to reach US$38 billion within 2024, making them the largest segment in plant-based foods. Nevertheless, using plant matrices to produce PMA has numerous limitations, including, among others, low stability and short shelf life. This review addresses the main obstacles facing quality and safety of PMA formula. Moreover, this literature overview discusses the emerging approaches, e.g., pulsed electric field (PEF), cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), ultrasound (US), ultra-high-pressure homogenization (UHPH), ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation, ozone (O3), and hurdle technology used in PMA formulations to overcome their common challenges. These emerging technologies have a vast potential at the lab scale to improve physicochemical characteristics, increase stability and extend the shelf-life, decrease food additives, increase nutritional and organoleptic qualities of the end product. Although the PMA fabrication on a large scale using these technologies can be expected in the near future to formulate novel food products that can offer green alternatives to conventional dairy products, further development is still needed for wider commercial applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7960-7558"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Technology Department, Arid Lands Cultivation Research Institute, City of Scientific Research and Technological Applications, Alexandria, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mehany", "ForeName": "Taha", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical University of Munich Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability, Straubing, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "German Institute of Food Technologies (DIL e.V.), Quakenbr\u00fcck, Germany."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Shahida Anusha", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3089-1196"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, First Technical University, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Olawoye", "ForeName": "Babatunde", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, First Technical University, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Olabisi Popoola", "ForeName": "Oyekemi", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3059-292X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sustainable AgriFoodtech Innovation and Research (SAFIR), Arras, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Syrian Academic Expertise (SAE), Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Hassoun", "ForeName": "Abdo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Food Manufacturing, Foshan University, Foshan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Manzoor", "ForeName": "Muhammad Faisal", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food, Nutrition, and Packaging Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Punia Bangar", "ForeName": "Sneh", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Quality"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36861223", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2183381"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
