Meteorological conditions and air pollutant concentrations in Shanghai, China, during the 6-year period were collected. We applied the overdispersed generalized additive model and the distributed lag model to explore the short-term cumulative effects of environmental factors on AD.", "AD symptoms were aggravated by extreme low temperature (1st percentile, 0.5\u00b0C) (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.16-1.51) and per 10 unit decrease of humidity (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.12-2.47). The increased concentration of air pollutants except ozone (O3) contributed to the increased risk of AD outpatients. A 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with 6.03% (95% CI: 2.29%, 9.91%), and 1.96% (95% CI: 0.46%, 3.48%) increase of AD outpatients. AD patients in the 8- to 17-year-old group were most susceptible to extreme low temperature, and patients in the 0- to 7-year-old group were most susceptible to air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM10), SO2, and NO2. Men were more sensitive to the effects of extreme low temperature than women, while women were more vulnerable to air pollutants. The adverse effects of SO2 and NO2 on AD can be enhanced significantly by the warm season or other pollutants.", "Exposure to a lower temperature, lower humidity, and higher levels of air pollutants is significantly associated with increased risks of AD incidence. These impacts were more pronounced in children less than 7 years old, women, and warm seasons."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 S.
