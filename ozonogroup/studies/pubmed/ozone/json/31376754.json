Changes of summertime ozone and free radical concentrations due to the additional heterogeneous reactions in north China were quantified. These heterogeneous reactions increased the O<sub>3</sub>, OH, HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by up to 20%, 28%, 36% and 48% for some regions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) area. These areas typically have a larger amount of NOx emissions and a lower VOC/NOx ratio. The zero-out method evaluates that the photolysis of ClNO<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> are the major contributors (42.4% and 57.6%, respectively) to atmospheric Cl in the early morning hours but the photolysis of Cl<sub>2</sub> is the only significant contributor after 10:00\u202fam. The results highlight that heterogeneous reactions of reactive chlorine species are important to atmospheric ozone and free-radical formation. Our study also suggests that the on-going NOx emission controls in the NCP region with a goal to reduce both O<sub>3</sub> and secondary nitrate can also have the co-benefit of reducing the formation Cl from ClNO<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub>, which may also lead to lower secondary organic aerosol formation and thus the control of summertime PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
