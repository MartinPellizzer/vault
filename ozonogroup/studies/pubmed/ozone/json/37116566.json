In recent years, an unexpected increase in O<sub>3</sub> levels over the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California has been observed despite reduced precursor emissions and the driving factors behind this abnormal condition remain unclear. In this work, we combine ambient measurements, satellite data, and air quality modeling to investigate O<sub>3</sub> and precursor emission trends and explore the impacts of meteorological variability and emission changes on O<sub>3</sub> over the SoCAB from 2012 to 2020. Changes in O<sub>3</sub> trends were characterized by declining O<sub>3</sub> in 2012-2015, and increasing O<sub>3</sub> afterwards with the most extreme O<sub>3</sub> exceedances in 2020. Basin-wide increases of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over warm season were depicted between 2012 and 2020, with the most significant enhancements (5-10\u00a0ppb) observed in San Bernardino County. Persistent heatwaves and weak ventilation on consecutive days were closely correlated with O<sub>3</sub> exceedances (r<sup>2</sup> above 0.6) over inland SoCAB. While decreasing trends in NO<sub>x</sub> (-4.1%/yr) and VOC emissions (-1.8%/yr) inferred from emission inventory and satellites during 2012-2020 resulted in a slow transition for O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity from VOCs-limited to NO<sub>x</sub>-limited, model simulations performed with fixed meteorology indicate that unfavorable meteorological conditions could largely offset regulation benefits, with meteorology anomaly-induced monthly O<sub>3</sub> changes reaching 20\u00a0ppb (May 2020) and the deterioration of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in 2016, 2017, and 2020 was largely attributed to unfavorable meteorological conditions. Nevertheless, anthropogenic emission changes may act as the dominant factor in governing O<sub>3</sub> variations across the SoCAB when net effects of meteorology are neutral (typically 2018). This work provides a comprehensive assessment of O<sub>3</sub> pollution and contributes valuable insights into understanding the long-term changes of O<sub>3</sub> and precursors in guiding future regulation efforts in the SoCAB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
