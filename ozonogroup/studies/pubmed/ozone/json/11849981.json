Plant material from natural environments, as well as from outdoor treatments was examined. In long-term outdoor experiments plants were grown under three different levels of UV-B radiation: reduced and ambient UV-B levels, and a UV-B level simulating 17% ozone depletion. The following parameters were monitored: contents of total methanol soluble UV-absorbing compounds and chlorophyll a, terminal electron transport system (ETS) activity and optimal and effective quantum yield of photosystem II. No effect of the different UV-B levels on the measured parameters was observed. The amount of UV-B absorbing compounds seems to be saturated, since no differences were observed between treatments and no increase was found in peak season, when natural UV-B levels were the highest. Physiological measurements revealed no harmful effects; neither on potential and actual photochemical efficiency, nor on terminal ETS activity. The contents of UV-B absorbing compounds were examined also in plant material sampled in low and high altitude environments during the growth season. Both species exhibited no seasonal dynamics of production of UV-absorbing compounds. The contents were variable and showed no significant differences between high and low altitude populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Biology, Vecna pot 111, Ljubljana, Slovenia. alenka.gaberscik@uni-lj.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Germ", "ForeName": "Mateja", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mazej", "ForeName": "Zdenka", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gaberscik", "ForeName": "Alenka", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00e4der", "ForeName": "Donat P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11849981", "10.1016/s1011-1344(01)00273-1", "S1011134401002731"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
