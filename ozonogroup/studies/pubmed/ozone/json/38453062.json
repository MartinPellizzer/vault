People living with HIV (PLWH) may be more vulnerable to the health impacts of O<sub>3</sub> exposure due to their immunosuppressed state. This study aims to investigate the association between ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposure and mortality among PLWH, as well as the potential exacerbating effects of a decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell level. Daily maximum 8-hour O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were assigned to 7270\u00a0PLWH at a county level in Guangxi, China. Every 10-unit increase in ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with a significant rise in all-cause mortality ranging from 7.3\u00a0% to 28.7\u00a0% and a significant rise in AIDS-related mortality ranging from 8.4\u00a0% to 14.5\u00a0%. When PLWH had a higher CD4<sup>+</sup> count (\u2265350\u00a0cells/\u03bcL), elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with increased blood CD4<sup>+</sup> count at lag0 [percent change with 95\u00a0% confidence interval, 0.20(0.00, 0.40)], lag1 [0.26(0.06, 0.47)], and lag2 [0.23(0.03, 0.44)]; however, an opposite association was observed when CD4<sup>+</sup> count was <350\u00a0cells/\u03bcL for half-year average [-2.45(-4.71, -0.14)] and yearly average [-3.42(-5.51, -1.29)] of O<sub>3</sub> exposure. The association of O<sub>3</sub> exposure with all-cause and AIDS-related mortality was more prominent among those with higher CD4<sup>+</sup> count. Exploratory analysis revealed possible associations between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and respiratory infections and clinical symptoms. These findings suggest potential synergistic effects between a compromised immune status and elevated O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels on mortality risk among PLWH. Ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposure should be considered as an emerging mortality risk factor for PLWH in the era of antiretroviral therapy, requiring further attention from researchers and healthcare professionals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
