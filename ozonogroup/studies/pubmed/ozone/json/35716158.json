Sports-related enthesopathy shows pathological features, including hyperplasia of the fibrocartilage (FC) region in the enthesis. The amount of exercise and type of muscle contraction during movement is involved in the pathogenesis of sports-related enthesopathy; however, the details of this condition are unclear. Here we examined the molecular pathways involved in the morphological changes of the muscle-tendon-enthesis complex and enthesis FC region in the supraspinatus muscle enthesis of mice under different exercise conditions. Following intervention, morphological changes in the muscle-tendon-enthesis complex were initiated in the eccentric contraction-dominant exercise group at 2 weeks, with activation of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily pathway predicted by proteome and ingenuity pathway analyses. Histological and molecular biological analyses confirmed the activation of the TGF\u03b2/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-Smad pathway. The concentric contraction-dominant exercise group showed no change in the morphology of the muscle-tendon-enthesis complex or activation of the TGF\u03b2/BMP-Smad pathway, despite overuse exercise. Statement of Clinical Significance: These results suggest that eccentric contraction-dominant exercise induces sports-related enthesopathy-like morphological changes in the early stages as well as molecular biological changes, mainly in the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily pathway in enthesis.
