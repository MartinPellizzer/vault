Digesters 1 and 2 were fed with nonozonated and ozonated mixtures of vinasses and domestic sewage (1:10 by volume), respectively. Digesters 3 and 4 operated with pure vinasses at acid and neutral pH values, respectively. The effects of pH, temperature, and ozone dose conditions were studied. Preozonation removed inhibitory compounds and improved the growth of nitrifiers. Ozone dose is the key variable to treat a vinasse-domestic sewage effluent effectively with a combined chemical-biological system. Contois's kinetic model has been applied to experimental results, and kinetic parameters related to the maximum specific growth rate of microorganisms, mu(max), and inhibitory effects, alpha, were calculated and compared for nonozonated and ozonated wastewaters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Energ\u00e9tica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Extremadura, 06071 Badajoz, Spain. fbeltran@unex.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beltr\u00e1n", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Araya", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10552744", "10.1021/jf9812634", "jf9812634"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
