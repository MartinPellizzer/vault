We examined multipollutant models (with fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide) and effect measure modification by race/ethnicity and length of gestation. We found a 9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1, 18) increased stillbirth risk associated with a 3.6-parts-per-billion increase in O3 exposure. The risk was higher among women with pregnancies of <37 gestational weeks (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.23) compared with women with pregnancies of longer gestation (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.27) and among Hispanic women (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.27). We also conducted a case-crossover analysis and detected no associations with short-term exposure. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use time-to-event analyses to examine stillbirth risk associated with time-varying prenatal ozone (O3) exposure over pregnancy. Our findings indicate that maternal O3 exposure over pregnancy is associated with stillbirth risk and that Hispanic women and women with shorter pregnancies might be at particular risk."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
