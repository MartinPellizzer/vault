However, the association between exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u2264 1 \u03bcm (PM<sub>1</sub>) and GDM has not been explored.", "We conducted a cohort study involving 60,173 pregnant women from nine hospitals in Beijing, China, from February 2015 to April 2021. Daily concentrations of PM<sub>1</sub> and ozone were obtained from a validated spatiotemporal artificial intelligence model. We used a modified Poisson regression combined with distributed lag models to estimate the association between weekly-specific PM<sub>1</sub> exposure and the risk of GDM after adjusting for individual-level covariates.", "Among the 51,299 pregnant women included in the final analysis, 4008 were diagnosed with GDM. Maternal exposure to PM<sub>1</sub> during preconception and gestational periods was generally associated with an increased risk of GDM. The most pronounced associations were identified during the 12th week before pregnancy, the 5th-8th weeks of the first trimester, and the 23rd-24th weeks of the second trimester. Each 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>1</sub> was associated with a relative risk of GDM of 1.65 (95\u202f% CI: 1.59, 1.72) during the preconception period, 1.67 (95\u202f% CI: 1.61, 1.73) in the first trimester, 1.52 (95\u202f% CI: 1.47, 1.58) in the second trimester, and 2.54 (95\u202f% CI: 2.45, 2.63) when considering the first and second trimester combined.", "Exposure to PM<sub>1</sub> before and during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of GDM, particularly during the 12 weeks before pregnancy and gestational weeks 5-8 and 23-24."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
