This study was designed to address the extent to which irrigation of the contaminated abdominal cavity using a saline solution primed with ozone is effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. Gelatin capsules containing different quantities of a premixed slurry of filtered human fecal material were implanted in the peritoneal cavities of a preliminary series of rats. Three inocula concentrations were selected for later experiments, based upon their ability to produce morbid consequences: (1) high (100% 1-day mortality), (2) medium (70% 3-day mortality, 100% abscess rate in survivors), and (3) low (100% 10-day survival, 100% abscess rate). Fecal and abscess bacteriology were similar in all rats. The peritoneal cavities of 240 rats then underwent fecal-capsule implantation (three groups of 80 rats/inoculum concentration). At celiotomy 4 hours later, equal numbers of rats from each group were randomly assigned to one of four protocols: (1) no irrigation, (2) normal saline irrigation, (3) saline-cephalothin irrigation, and (4) ozonated saline irrigation. Each treatment lasted 5 minutes, using 100 ml of irrigation fluid. Mortality was significantly reduced when, in lieu of no irrigation, any of the irrigation solutions were used. Additionally, ozonated saline statistically proved the most effective irrigating solution for reducing abscess formation in survivors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70012."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozmen", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "W O", "Initials": "WO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Healy", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fish", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chambers", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tacchi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nichols", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flint", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferrara", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "0370522", "ISSNLinking": "0003-1348"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Abscess"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneal Lavage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Peritonitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8489098"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
