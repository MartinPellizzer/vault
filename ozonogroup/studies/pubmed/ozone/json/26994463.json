The distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) combined with a nested case-control study design was applied to estimate the nonlinear and delayed effects of cold or hot temperature on all natural mortality among subjects with different pre-existing diseases.", "The relative risk of all natural mortality associated with a decrease of temperature from 25th percentile (19.5\u00b0C) to 1st percentile (11.3\u00b0C) over 0-21 lag days for participants who reported to have an active disease at the baseline was 2.21 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19, 4.10) for diabetes mellitus (DM), 1.59 (1.12, 2.26) for circulatory system diseases (CSD), and 1.23 (0.53, 2.84) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas 1.04 (0.59, 1.85) for non-disease group (NDG). Compared with NDG, elders with COPD had excess risk of mortality associated with thermal stress attributable to hot temperature, while elders with DM and CSD were vulnerable to both hot and cold temperatures.", "Elders with pre-existing health conditions were more vulnerable to excess mortality risk to hot and/or cold temperature.
