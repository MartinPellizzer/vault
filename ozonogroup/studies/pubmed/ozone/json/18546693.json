Olefins with initial concentrations from 30 microM to 3mM were injected in a solvent (n-hexadecane, nonane, or cyclohexane) while an ozone-oxygen mixture was slowly bubbled through the solution. The number of ozone molecules consumed by the injection was quantified in the outgoing flow, and the expected 1:1 double bond-to-ozone reaction stoichiometry was observed only under subambient temperature conditions (T < 250 K). At room temperature, the effective number of double bonds oxidized by each ozone molecule increased to 2-5, with a higher degree of oxidation occurring at lower initial olefin concentrations. The observed enhancement in the stoichiometry is consistent with a competition between direct ozonation and free radical initiated oxidation of double bonds, with free radicals being produced by slow reactions between dissolved ozone and solvent molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-2025, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomez", "ForeName": "Anthony L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lewis", "ForeName": "Tanza L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkinson", "ForeName": "Stacy A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18546693", "10.1021/es800096d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
