Two viruses, tobacco etch virus (TEV) and tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV), are particularly damaging to burley. Burley tobacco cultivars resistant to these two viruses are currently being developed. Some of these cultivars also show differential sensitivity to ozone (O3). Recent field observations have suggested that burley tobacco infected with TEV and TVMV was more sensitive to O3 than non-virus-infected tobacco. Experiments were designed to identify interactions between O3 and each of the two virus diseases. Three cultivars, Burley 21, Burley 49, and Greeneville 131, which were differentially sensitive to O3 and both virus diseases, were grown in a charcoal-filtered greenhouse environment. Tobacco plants of each cultivar were inoculated with TEV or TVMV, and virus infected and virus-free plants were exposed to 0.0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.4 ppm O3 (1 ppm of O3 is equivalent to 1960 microg m(-3)), 3h day(-1), 5 days week(-1) for 3 weeks in continuous-stirred tank reactor exposure chambers in the greenhouse. Exposures were begun after systemic virus symptoms were expressed in inoculated plants. The suppression of lead and stem dry weight by increasing O3 concentrations was less in TEV-infected burley cultivars than in noninfected burley cultivars. Tobacco vein mottling virus infection enhanced biomass suppression by O3 on Burley 21 and on Greeneville 131, but not on Burley 49. Thus, the interactions with O3 were dependent on specific virus-cultivar combinations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reinert", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rufty", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eason", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092551", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90035-8", "0269749188900358"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
