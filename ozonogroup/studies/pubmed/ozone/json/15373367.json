The degree of correlation between hourly PN and concentrations of CO, NO, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at each site over the entire year was generally low to moderate (r values in the range of 0.1-0.5), with a few notable exceptions. In general, associations between PN and O3 were either negative or insignificant. Similar analyses of seasonal data resulted in levels of correlation with large variation, ranging from 0.0 to 0.94 depending on site and season. Summertime data showed a generally higher correlation between the 24-hr average PN concentrations and CO, NO, and NO2 than corresponding hourly concentrations. Hourly correlations between PN and both CO and NO were strengthened during morning rush-hour periods, indicating a common vehicular source. Comparing hourly particle number concentrations between sites also showed low to moderate spatial correlations, with most correlation coefficients below 0.4. Given the low to moderate associations found in this study, gaseous co-pollutants should not be used as surrogates to assess human exposure to airborne particle number concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90089, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sardar", "ForeName": "Satya B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fine", "ForeName": "Philip M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Heesong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sioutas", "ForeName": "Constantinos", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15373367", "10.1080/10473289.2004.10470970"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
