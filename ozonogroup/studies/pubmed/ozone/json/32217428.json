The incidence of pediatric-onset IBD is increasing faster than IBD diagnosed in older individuals. Previous epidemiological studies have shown that air pollution might be a risk factor for development of earlier-onset IBD, but results remain mixed.", "The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between maternal and early-life exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>,) and oxidant capacity (O<sub>x</sub>) and risk of pediatric-onset IBD diagnosis.", "We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked population-based health administrative data. Singleton livebirths in Ontario, Canada between April 1st, 1991 and March 31st, 2014 were included. We investigated the association between weekly exposures during pregnancy and annual exposures from birth until the age of 18\u00a0years, and IBD diagnosed <18\u00a0years of age using Cox proportional hazards models. We reported hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for an associated increase in the interquartile range (IQR) of each pollutant. Models were mutually adjusted for exposures in both prenatal and postnatal periods, as well as for sex, rurality of residence at birth, maternal IBD, and neighborhood income.", "2,218,789 newborns were included in this study, of whom 2491 developed IBD during follow-up. Increased associations with pediatric-onset IBD were noted for childhood exposure to O<sub>x</sub> (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16). IBD development was also associated with O<sub>x</sub> during the second trimester (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.42), but not the overall pregnancy period (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.79-1.59). There were no associations of IBD with exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, or O<sub>3</sub>.", "Exposure to O<sub>x</sub> during childhood was associated with IBD\u00a0<\u00a018\u00a0years.
