Visible foliar injuries, carbon assimilation (A(sat)), stomatal conductance, superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity and ascorbic acid concentration (AA) were evaluated in different-aged leaves of Psidium guajava 'Paluma' saplings. We hypothesized that the old leaves are less capable of combating the stress induced by O(3) and hence exhibit more severe leaf injuries. Three O(3) exposure experiments were performed with 'Paluma' saplings in sites with high O(3) concentration and also under filtered air conditions. The exposure experiments corresponding to the seasons spring/2006, summer and autumn/2007. The decrease of A(sat) was greater in old leaves of saplings exposed to O(3), except in the second experiment, when the AA concentrations were more pronounced than in the other experiments. In second experiment, O(3) uptake was similar to that of the first experiment, but the injuries were less severe, probably due to the high AA concentrations. It was not possible to identify a pattern of superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity due to the high variability in the results from O(3) exposed and reference saplings. O(3) uptake/A(sat) was higher in leaves exhibiting greater injury, suggesting that decrease in A(sat) may have been the main feature associated with the visible foliar symptons."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.
