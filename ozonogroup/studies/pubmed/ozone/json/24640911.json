The light source and the biofilm carrier were ozone producing lamp at 185 nm and the peat, palm fiber, porous acticarbon, respectively. Styrene inlet concentration was controlled between 320-583 mg x m(-3), and the removal efficiency remained above 95% after stabilization. The UV converted styrene into more soluble and biodegradable intermediates, such as alcohol, aldehyde and acid, thus the performance of biofilter can be improved. In the stable operation stage, the variation of inlet concentration did not affect the removal efficiency when the total residence time (TRT) was long, however, the inlet concentration obviously affected the removal efficiency when the TRT decreased. The removal load of coupling system increased linearly with increasing inlet load, and the removal efficiency was higher than 95% under a TRT of 102 s. When TRT was 68 s and the inlet load was low, the variation of removal load complied with the law described above, but it gradually deviated from the straight line and tended to stabilized at a certain value when the inlet load became higher than 30 g x (m3 x h)(-). If considering the fluctuation of styrene concentration only, the contribution rate of ultraviolet photolysis to styrene removal was greater than that of the biofilter, and the removal effect could be restored on the fourth day, after closing the system for ten days and restarting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sha", "ForeName": "Hao-Lei", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Guo-Jing", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Jing-Fen", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "44LJ2U959V", "NameOfSubstance": "Styrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Styrene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24640911"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
