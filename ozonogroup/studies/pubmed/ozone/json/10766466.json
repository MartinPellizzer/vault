Although strategies such as steering around meteorological areas of high ozone concentrations or outfitting the C-5 with ventilation system modifications were recommended by past investigators, review has shown that such changes were not adopted. Informal interviews with current C-5 aircrews indicate mucosal dryness and irritation are routinely encountered during long duration flights. Such symptoms could be due to low humidity or perhaps, ozone-induced irritation. With the advent of miniaturized, highly accurate, electronic air quality monitoring equipment, a repeat study of cabin ozone was believed to be warranted to better clarify exposure risk and to look for other possible explanations for the encountered symptoms.", "A portable, electronic air quality monitor was used to monitor breathing zone cabin air during 47 h of flight. Ozone, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, temperature, and relative humidity were recorded for the duration. Ozone levels were corrected for altitude using a calibration curve derived by earlier, unpublished hypobaric chamber work.", "Ozone levels were not found to exceed the FAA ceiling limit. Two flights had 3-h time-weighted average values that minimally exceeded FAA standards. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide levels were well below health effect threshold. Relative humidity reached a nadir of 3% and could well have explained symptoms of mucosal irritation.", "Current evidence suggests that C-5 aircrews are exposed to relatively low concentrations of ozone. Review of the literature regarding observed short-term and long-term toxicity to low dose ozone exposure would indicate that no further operational or aircraft design action is required."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Air Force Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Residency in Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, TX, USA. smhetrick@mosquitonet.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hetrick", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gould", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christensen", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Aviat Space Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7501714", "ISSNLinking": "0095-6562"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerospace Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10766466"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
