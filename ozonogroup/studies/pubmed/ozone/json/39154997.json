However, there is an existing knowledge gap on the toxicity of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q to aquatic plants. A model aquatic plant, Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), was subjected to 6PPD and 6PPD-Q at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, and 400\u202f\u03bcg/L to investigate their effects on plant growth, photosynthetic, antioxidant system, and metabolic behavior. The results showed that 6PPD-Q enhanced the photosynthetic efficiency of C. vulgaris, promoting growth of C. vulgaris at low concentrations (50, 100, and 200\u202f\u03bcg/L) while inhibiting growth at high concentration (400\u202f\u03bcg/L). 6PPD-Q induced more oxidative stress than 6PPD, disrupting cell permeability and mitochondrial membrane potential stability. C. vulgaris responded to contaminant-induced oxidative stress by altering antioxidant enzyme activities and active substance levels. Metabolomics further identified fatty acids as the most significantly altered metabolites following exposure to both contaminants. In conclusion, this study compares the toxicity of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q to C. vulgaris, with 6PPD-Q demonstrating higher toxicity. This study provides valuable insight into the risk assessment of tire wear particles (TWPs) derived chemicals in aquatic habitats and plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
