We observed that while only inorganic As(III) is reduced to AsH(3) at low current densities, at high current densities both forms of inorganic As are reduced. We describe a unique electrochemical reactor in which the cylindrical anode compartment is isolated from the outer concentric cathode compartment by a Nafion tube in which a hole is deliberately made and the entire anode compartment is inside the cylindrical cavity of a small volume (\u223c115 \u03bcL) cathode chamber. The evolved arsine is then quantitated by gas-phase chemiluminescence (GPCL) reaction with ozone; the latter is generated from oxygen formed during electrolysis. For the dimensions used, inorganic As(III) can be selectively determined at a current of 0.1 A while total inorganic As (both As(III) and As(V)) respond equally at an applied electrolysis current at 0.85 A, without any sample treatment. For a 1-mL sample, the system provides a limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) of 0.09 \u03bcg/L for total As (i = 0.85 A) and an LOD of 0.76 \u03bcg/L for As(III) (i = 0.10 A); As(V) is obtained by difference. Comparison of ICP-MS results for total As in groundwater samples that span a large range of concentration and total inorganic As determined by the present method showed a high correlation (r(2) = 0.9975) and a near unity slope. The basic electrochemical arsine generation technique and current-differentiated oxidation state speciation should be applicable as the front end to many other arsenic measurements techniques, including atomic spectrometry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas 76019-0065, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sengupta", "ForeName": "Mrinal K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dasgupta", "ForeName": "Purnendu K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22035322", "10.1021/ac201972m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
