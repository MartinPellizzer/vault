The degradation kinetics and mechanisms of NPYR degradation by the O3/UV process were investigated and compared with those of UV direct photolysis and ozonation. A synergistic effect of ozone and UV was observed in the degradation of NPYR due to the accelerated production of OH\u2022 by ozone photolysis. This effect was more pronounced at higher ozone dosages. The second-order rate constants of NPYR reacting with OH\u2022 and ozone was determined to be 1.38 (\u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and 0.31 (\u00b1 0.02) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. The quantum yield by direct UV photolysis was 0.3 (\u00b1 0.01). An empirical model using Rct (the ratio of the exposure of OH\u2022 to that of ozone) was established for NPYR degradation in treated drinking water and showed that the contributions of direct UV photolysis and OH\u2022 oxidation on NPYR degradation were both significant. As the reaction proceeded, the contribution by OH\u2022 became less important due to the exhausting of ozone. Nitrate was the major product in the O3/UV process by two possible pathways. One is through the cleavage of nitroso group to form NO\u2022 followed by hydrolysis, and the other is the oxidation of the intermediates of amines by ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
