Taking the 2D graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub>heterojunction as a model system, we demonstrate that the band structure can be finely tuned by changing the graphene structure of the 2D heterojunction via ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>). With increasing UV/O<sub>3</sub>exposure time, graphene in the heterojunction has more defect structures. The varied defect levels in graphene modulate the interfacial charge transfer, accordingly the band structure of the heterojunction. And the corresponding performance change of the graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub>field effect transistor indicates the shift of the Schottky barrier height after UV/O<sub>3</sub>treatment. The result further proves the effective band structure modulation of the graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub>heterojunction by UV/O<sub>3</sub>. This work will be beneficial to both fundamental research and practical applications of 2D van der Waals heterojunction in electronic devices."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 IOP Publishing
