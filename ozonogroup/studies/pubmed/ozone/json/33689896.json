Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and PAC were simultaneously applied to treat a mixture of 17 micropollutants (MPs) at low concentrations, including 13 compounds that were studied for the first time by simultaneous addition of O<sub>3</sub> and PAC system. Synergy and catalysis improved the removals and specific degradation rates of MPs in the first minute of the treatment. Radical probing experiments showed that scavenging hydroxyl radicals (OH) did not have a significant impact on the removals, while scavenging other reactive oxygen species was more influential. A detailed study by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy ascertained that the decomposition of ozone in presence of PAC at neutral pH did not boost the generation of free OH. Instead, adsorbed OH was likely produced as PAC-HO along with other oxidizing species resulting from adsorbed singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
