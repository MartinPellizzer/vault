Patient demographics and hospital course were gathered. Environmental data on the dates of presentation, including precipitation, humidity, and air pollution, were obtained from regional Environmental Protection Agency online data banks and used for statistical analysis.", "In total, 408 patients, representing 450 episodes of angioedema, met the inclusion criteria for the study. Most patients were female (58%), African American (74%), and on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) upon presentation (61%). Days with unhealthy levels of air pollution were associated with an increased likelihood of angioedema presentation (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; confidence interval [CI], 1.01-3.30; <i>P</i> = .046). Subgroup analysis revealed that elevated ground-level ozone was the primary air pollutant significantly associated with angioedema presentations (OR, 4.95; CI 1.92-12.76; <i>P</i> = .0009). Higher ground-level ozone was also associated with ACE-I angioedema presentations (<i>P</i> = .017) but not with non-ACE-I angioedema presentations (<i>P</i> = .86). Air quality was not predictive of angioedema severity or need for intubation.", "Angioedema is a complex, multifactorial disease resulting in potentially life-threatening complications. This is the first study to demonstrate that higher levels of air pollution, specifically ground-level ozone, are associated with significantly increased rates of angioedema episodes, although not severity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kedarisetty", "ForeName": "Suraj", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Evan", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tint", "ForeName": "Derrick", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soliman", "ForeName": "Ahmed M S", "Initials": "AMS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "8508176", "ISSNLinking": "0194-5998"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Angioedema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31038389", "10.1177/0194599819846446"]}}]}
