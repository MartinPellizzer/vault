In UV/H2O2 system, with the increase of H2O2 dosage, removal efficiencies of COD and the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) to chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the effluent were increased and a better performance was obtained than the H2O2 system alone. In UV/H2O2 system, removal efficiency of COD reach 68% under the optimum condition, and BOD/COD ratio was significantly increased from 0.22 to 0.52. In UV/O3 system, with the increase of O3 dosage, removal efficiency of COD and BOD/COD ratio were increased, and a better performance was obtained than the O3 system alone. Under the optimum condition, removal efficiency of COD was 54%, and BOD/COD ratio was significantly increased from 0.22 to 0.48. In UV/H2O2/O3 system, COD removal efficiency was found to be 22.0% higher than UV/O3 system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CAS, Beijing 100085, China. yuzhengzhe2002@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zheng-zhe", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "De-zhi", "Initials": "DZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chang-hai", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Peng-fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Xiao-dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Guo-rong", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jun-xin", "Initials": "JX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caustics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caustics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15137653"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
