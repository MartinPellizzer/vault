Its results showed that as typical odorants, ethanethiol was effectively removed by oxidation and geosmin and 2-MIB were removed by both oxidation and adsorption, but geosmin and 2-MIB's adsorption effect was better than oxidation. When thiol and thioether in raw water was less than 20 microg/L, furthermore, there was not any other odorant, potassium permanganate oxidation should be equipped with enhanced coagulations. When geosmin and 2-MIB in raw was less than 30 ng/L, activated carbon adsorption should be equipped with enhanced coagulations. When thiol and thioether in raw water was more than 20 microg/L, or geosmin and 2-MIB was more than 30 ng/L, ozone-activated carbon process should be added after the conventional water treatment process. When thiol and thioether in raw water was more than 150 microg/L, or geosmin and 2-MIB was more than 100 ng/L, preoxidation or adsorption of powder activated carbon at intake should be combined with ozone-activated carbon according to the odorant composing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. yongli05@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jian", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Ji-Sheng", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M439R54A1D", "NameOfSubstance": "ethanethiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MYW912WXJ4", "NameOfSubstance": "geosmin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19186800"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
