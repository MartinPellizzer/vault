The preferential site of oxidation of cholesterol by highly reactive species is at C7 having a relatively weak carbon-hydrogen bond. Cholesterol autoxidation is known to proceed via two distinct pathways, a free radical pathway driven by a chain reaction mechanism (type I autoxidation) and a non-free radical pathway (type II autoxidation). Oxysterols arising from type II autoxidation of cholesterol have no enzymatic correlates, and singlet oxygen ((1)\u0394gO2) and ozone (O3) are the non-radical molecules involved in the mechanism. Four primary derivatives are possible in the reaction of cholesterol with singlet oxygen via ene addition and the formation of 5\u03b1-, 5\u03b2-, 6\u03b1- and 6\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol preceded by their respective hydroperoxyde intermediates. The reaction of ozone with cholesterol is very fast and gives rise to a complex array of oxysterols. The site of the initial ozone reaction is at the \u03945,6 -double bond and yields 1,2,3-trioxolane, a compound that rapidly decomposes into a series of unstable intermediates and end products. The downstream product 3\u03b2-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al (sec-A, also called 5,6-secosterol), resulting from cleavage of the B ring, and its aldolization product (sec-B) have been proposed as a specific marker of ozone-associated tissue damage and ozone production in vivo. The relevance of specific ozone-modified cholesterol products is, however, hampered by the fact sec-A and sec-B can also arise from singlet oxygen via Hock cleavage of 5\u03b1-hydroperoxycholesterol or via a dioxietane intermediate. Whatever the mechanism may be, sec-A and sec-B have no enzymatic route of production in vivo and are reportedly bioactive, rendering them attractive biomarkers to elucidate oxidative stress-associated pathophysiological pathways and to develop pharmacological agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.
