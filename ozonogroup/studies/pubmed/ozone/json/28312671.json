After leaf abscission, decomposition of individual leaf discs was measured in containers of stream water. Exposure of plants to 200 ppb ozone for 5 h caused early leaf abscission and changes in the chemical composition of leaves at time of abscission. Early-abscised leaves from O<sub>3</sub>-exposed plants had higher nitrogen, but decomposed more slowly than leaves from control plants. Leaves from O<sub>3</sub>-exposed plants that abscised at the normal time had lower nitrogen content and lower specific leaf mass than control leaves, but decomposed at the same rate as leaves from control plants. The results imply that O<sub>3</sub> exposure can alter fundamental processes important to the functioning of detritus-based aquatic ecosystems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecosystem Studies, The New York Botanical Garden, Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum, 12545, Millbrook, NY, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Findlay", "ForeName": "Stuart", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecosystem Studies, The New York Botanical Garden, Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum, 12545, Millbrook, NY, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Clive G", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1988;52(4):303-13", "ArticleIdList": ["15092603"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1988 Jun;76(1):51-56", "ArticleIdList": ["28312378"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1988 Jun;76(1):57-61", "ArticleIdList": ["28312379"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28312671", "10.1007/BF00323541", "10.1007/BF00323541"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
