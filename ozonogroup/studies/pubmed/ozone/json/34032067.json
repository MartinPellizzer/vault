Network analysis and inverse distance weighted (IDW) spatial autocorrelation and backward trajectories analyses were performed. The results indicate that O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased between 2014 and 2017, and monthly variations showed a unimodal trend. The typical period of peak O<sub>3</sub> pollution (O<sub>3</sub> \u2265 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) was from May to September, characterized by high temperatures, low humidity, weak winds, and strong solar radiation. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were negatively correlated with the NO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased year-on-year since 2015 in main urban area, and the dominant pollutant type had changed from NO<sub>2</sub> (2014 to 2016) to VOCs (2016 and 2017). However, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration of county-areas limited by the VOCs. The main factors affecting O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were industry, agriculture, economy, and population, and centers of O<sub>3</sub> pollution associated with secondary industry appeared in the main urban areas of Shijiazhuang and Luancheng. Moreover, VOCs trajectories during the summer monitoring period were clustered in three source directions:(A) East-northeast, 26.67%; (B) Northwest-west, 43.33%; and (C) Southeast-south, 30%). Trajectories (A) and (C) were the dominant directions of VOC transmission (east-southeast)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Sai-Sai", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Ya-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jian-Sheng", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shijiazhuang Meteorological Bureau, Shijiazhuang 050081, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Da-Xi", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shijiazhuang Meteorological Bureau, Shijiazhuang 050081, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Wen-Ya", "Initials": "WY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34032067", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202011090"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
