Anaerobic digestion is one of the management options of OFMSW. However, it generates unavoidable environmental impacts that should be addressed. The present study focuses to assess the environmental impact of a full-scale anaerobic digestion plant in Sri Lanka from a life cycle perspective. The inventory data were obtained from direct interviews and field measurements. Environmental burdens were found to be in terms of global warming potential (230\u2009kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq) ozone formation on human health (6.15\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-6</sup>\u2009kg NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> eq), freshwater eutrophication (2.92\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-3</sup>\u2009kg P eq), freshwater ecotoxicity (9.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>\u2009kg 1,4 DCB eq), human carcinogenic toxicity (3.98\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-4</sup>\u2009kg 1,4 DCB eq), land use (1.32\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-4</sup>\u2009m<sup>2</sup> a crop eq) and water consumption (2.23\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-2</sup>\u2009m<sup>3</sup>). The stratospheric ozone depletion, fine particulate matter formation, ozone formation on terrestrial ecosystems, terrestrial acidification, marine eutrophication, ecotoxicity (terrestrial and marine), human non-carcinogenic toxicity, mineral resource scarcity and fossil resource scarcity, were avoided due to electricity production. Results show that the direct gaseous emissions and digestate generation should be addressed in order to reduce the burdens from the anaerobic digestion plant. Finally, the results of the study could help in policy formation and decision-making in selecting future waste management systems in Sri Lanka."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Bio-Chemical Engineering and Technology, Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Weligama Thuppahige", "ForeName": "Rasangika Thathsaranee", "Initials": "RT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2378-4891"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Bio-Chemical Engineering and Technology, Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Babel", "ForeName": "Sandhya", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9881064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solid Waste"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33908286", "10.1177/0734242X211013405"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
