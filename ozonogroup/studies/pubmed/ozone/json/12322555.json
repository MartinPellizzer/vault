This article reports on the human suffering caused by air pollution in terms of mortality and morbidity. Based on interviews with scientists, health experts and victims, it is noted that the cities of Thailand, Mexico, Japan, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and the US have the highest levels of air pollution. In these areas people suffer from respiratory illnesses such as pharyngitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, asthma, flu, and loss of lung function. A most alarming finding indicates that residents of Los Angeles exposed to ozone pollution have double the risk of cancer compared to residents of cleaner cities. Aggravating this situation is the fact that governments often opt to sacrifice human health and lives when forced to choose between protecting the public and shielding industry from pollution regulations."]}], "OtherID": ["150742", "00295669"], "PMID": "12322555", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0020-9112", "JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "1995", "Season": "Sep-Oct"}}, "Title": "International wildlife", "ISOAbbreviation": "Int Wildl"}, "ArticleTitle": "Poisons in the air.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "38", "EndPage": "45", "MedlinePgn": "38-45"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int Wildl", "NlmUniqueID": "101086486", "ISSNLinking": "0020-9112"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12322555"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
