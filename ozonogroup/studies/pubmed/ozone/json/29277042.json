Greater TOC removal was achieved in Fe-Cu-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> process (78%) than those in Fe-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> (65%), Cu-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> (73%) and sole ozonation (42%). But it was interesting that both Cu-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> and Fe-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> achieved 93% bromate inhibition efficiency, only 71% inhibition efficiency was observed in Fe-Cu-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub>. Influence of pH, TBA/NaHSO<sub>3</sub> and detection of by-products were conducted to explore the mechanism. By Pyridine adsorption-IR and XPS, a relationship was found among activity of catalysts, Lewis acid sites and electron transfer effect between Fe (II/III) and Cu (I/II). Fe-Cu-MCM-41 promoted ozone decomposition to generate OH, which accounted for enhanced DCF mineralization. The consumption of aqueous O<sub>3</sub> also suppressed the oxidative of Br<sup>-</sup> and HBrO/Br<sup>-</sup>. More HBrO/BrO<sup>-</sup> accumulated in catalytic ozonation process and less bromate generated. Bromate formation in Fe-Cu-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> process was sensitive with pH value, the acidic condition was not favor for bromate formation. Both DCF mineralization and bromate inhibition were influenced by surface reaction. Moreover, Fe-Cu-MCM-41 showed excellent catalytic performance in suppressing the accumulation of carboxylic acid, especially for oxalic acid. Nearly no oxalic acid was detected during Fe-Cu-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
