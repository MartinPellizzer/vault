However, little information is known about the combined and interactive effects from increased air temperature (IT) and elevated O<sub>3</sub> (EO) exposures on urban tree species. Here, Ginkgo biloba and Populus alba 'Berolinensis' seedlings were subjected to IT (+2\u00a0\u00b0C of ambient air temperature) and/or EO (+2-fold ambient air O<sub>3</sub> concentrations) for one growing season by using open-top chambers. IT alone had no significant effect on physiological metabolisms at the early growing stage, but significantly increased photosynthetic parameters, antioxidative enzyme activities (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). EO alone decreased physiological parameters except for increased oxidative stress. Compared to EO exposure alone, plants grown under IT and EO combined showed higher antioxidative and photosynthetic activity. There was a significant interactive effect between IT and EO on net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry, the actual quantum efficiency of PSII, enzyme activities, aboveground biomass and root/shoot ratio (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), respectively. These results suggested that during one growing season, IT mitigated the adverse effect of EO on the tested plants. In addition, we found that G.\u00a0biloba was more sensitive than P.\u00a0alba 'Berolinensis' to both IT and EO, suggesting that G.\u00a0biloba may be a good indicator species for climate warming and air pollution, particularly under environmental conditions as they co-occur in urban areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
