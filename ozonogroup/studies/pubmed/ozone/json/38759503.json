Children, typically having more limited geographical movement and thus more consistent environmental contaminant exposure, might offer more reliable insights into which environmental contaminants affect the incidence of brain tumors. The present study is the first to focus on exploring whether a possible association exists between the incidence of PBTs and exposure to environmental pollutants in New Jersey (NJ).", "Linear regressions were run between PBT incidence and the concentration of air quality pollutants such as Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5), Particulate Matter 10 (PM10), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Similarly, linear regressions were run between PBT incidence and Elevated Blood Lead Levels (BLL).", "The study observed a significant positive relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and PBT incidence (\u03b2 = 0.34, p = 0.028). However, the relationship between PBT incidence, and environmental pollutants such as CO (\u03b2 = 0.0047, p = 0.098), PM2.5 (\u03b2 = -0.2624, p = 0.74), and PM10 (\u03b2 = -0.7353, p = 0.073) were found to be nonsignificant. For elevated BLL, nonsignificant relationships with PBT incidence were observed at 10-14\u202f\u00b5g/dL (\u03b2 = -39.38, p = 0.30), 15-19\u202f\u00b5g/dL (\u03b2 = -67.00, p = 0.21), and 20-44\u202f\u00b5g/dL (\u03b2 = -201.98, p = 0.12).", "The results indicate a possible impact of O<sub>3</sub> on the incidence of PBTs in NJ. In contrast to the significant links found in prior studies of adult brain tumors, the associations between PBT occurrence and particulate matter were not significant. These findings highlight the importance of further investigating how environmental factors, especially O<sub>3</sub>, relate to PBTs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
