The levels of O3 in SPW, SPS, and SA, and of CO in SA were higher than the acceptable ones. In relation to O3 and CO exposures, adolescents from SPW and SA had a significant risk of current wheezing, whereas living in SPW was associated with a high risk of rhinoconjunctivitis, eczema, and flexural eczema and living in CR to rhinitis. Exposure to NO2 was associated with a high risk of current wheezing in SPW and SA, and of severe asthma in SPW and PoA. Exposure to SO2 was associated with a high risk of current wheezing in SPW and SA, severe asthma in SPW and PoA, and nighttime cough, eczema, flexural eczema and severe eczema in SPW. Living in SPW, CR, or PoA was associated with a high risk of rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and severe rhinitis.", "Although we did not detect a characteristic pattern for all symptoms evaluated or a specific air pollutant, our data suggest a relationship between higher exposure to photochemical pollutants and high prevalence or risk of symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, and atopic eczema."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy, Clinical Immunology, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. dirceus@ajato.com.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sol\u00e9", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Camelo-Nunes", "ForeName": "I C", "Initials": "IC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wandalsen", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pastorino", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacob", "ForeName": "C M A", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wandalsen", "ForeName": "N F", "Initials": "NF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ros\u00e1rio Filho", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "G B", "Initials": "GB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naspitz", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9107858", "ISSNLinking": "1018-9068"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17323857"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
