The EDU concentration in different plant tissues was measured by HPLC. EDU accumulated in leaves and persisted for more than 10 days showing a slow degradation. Using five different EDU concentrations, a significant relationship between EDU concentration in nutrient solution, ozone tolerance and EDU concentration in leaves was shown. Leaves which contained more EDU were less sensitive to ozone damage. Investigations on protoplasts and cell cultures showed that EDU did not enter the cells. Possible implications of EDU accumulation in the leaf apoplast are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Terza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gatta", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mancino", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Federico", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093410", "10.1016/s0269-7491(97)00035-3", "S0269-7491(97)00035-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
