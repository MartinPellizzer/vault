In order to elucidate the consequences of this exposure, date palm saplings were treated with ambient, 1.5 and 2.0 times ambient O<sub>3</sub> for three months in a free-air controlled exposure facility. Chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure reduced carbohydrate contents in leaves and roots, but this effect was much stronger in roots. Still, sucrose contents of both organs were maintained at elevated O<sub>3</sub>, though at different steady states. Reduced availability of carbohydrate for the Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) may be responsible for the observed reduced foliar contents of several amino acids, whereas malic acid accumulation in the roots indicates a reduced use of TCA cycle intermediates. Carbohydrate deficiency in roots, but not in leaves caused oxidative stress upon chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure, as indicated by enhanced malonedialdehyde, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and oxidized glutathione contents despite elevated glutathione reductase activity. Reduced levels of phenolics and flavonoids in the roots resulted from decreased production and, therefore, do not indicate oxidative stress compensation by secondary compounds. These results show that roots of date palms are highly susceptible to chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure as a consequence of carbohydrate deficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
