Forty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: control, Cd, Cd and Ox, Cd and Oz, and Oz. During our research, Cd concentration (ASA) and MT concentration (ELISA) were determined in supernatants of the kidneys, liver and pancreas. SDS-PAGE analyses and immunohistochemical localization were used to evaluate the level of MT expression in the tissue. In rats intoxicated with Cd, the highest concentration of both Cd and MT was observed in the kidneys and liver, with a significantly lower concentration measured in the pancreas. Ozone therapy reduces the accumulation of cadmium in the liver and kidneys, resulting in a reduced expression of metallothionein in those tissues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
