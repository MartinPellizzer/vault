At a receptor site in the center of the AOSR ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, HONO, HNO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were measured during the April-August 2011 period. Concentrations of NH<sub>3</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were also monitored across the AOSR with passive samplers, providing monthly summer and bi-monthly winter average values in 2010, 2011 and 2012. During the fire, hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations >450\u03bcgm<sup>-3</sup> were measured at the AMS 1 receptor site. The 24-h National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 35\u03bcgm<sup>-3</sup> and the Canada Wide Standard (CWS) of 30\u03bcgm<sup>-3</sup> were exceeded on 13days in May and 7days in June. During the fire emission periods, sharp increases in NH<sub>3</sub>, HONO, HNO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and total inorganic reactive N concentrations occurred, all closely correlated with the PM<sub>2.5</sub> changes. There were large differences in the relative contribution of various N compounds to total inorganic N between the no-fire emission and fire emission periods. While in the absence of fires NO and NO<sub>2</sub> dominated, their relative contribution during the fires was ~2 fold smaller, mainly due to increased NH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Concentrations of HONO and HNO<sub>3</sub> also greatly increased during the fires, but their contribution to the total inorganic N pool was relatively small. Elevated NH<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> concentrations affected large areas of northern Alberta during the Richardson Fire. While NH<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> concentrations were not at levels considered toxic to plants, these gases contributed significantly to atmospheric N deposition. Generally, no significant changes in O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were detected and their ambient concentrations were below levels harmful to human health or sensitive vegetation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, 4955 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, CA 92507, USA.
