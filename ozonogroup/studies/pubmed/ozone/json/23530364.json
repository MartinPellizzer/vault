This study was focused on optimization of photocatalytic ozonation processes for removal of CTC from wastewater at pH 2.2 and 7.0. In this study, the tested processes for CTC removal were arranged from the least efficient to the most efficient as: UV, UV/TiO2, O3, O3/UV and O3/UV/TiO2. Ozonation efficiency was due to ozone affinity for electron-rich sites on the CTC molecule. In the O3/UV and O3/UV/TiO2 processes, efficiency was increased by the photolysis of CTC and generation of *OH. At pH 7.0, all the processes were more efficient for CTC degradation than at pH 2.2 due to CTC speciation, ozone decay to *OH and the attractions between ionized CTC and TiO2 particles. UV/O3 at pH 7.0 showed an additive effect while other combination processes showed a synergistic effect that resulted in higher rates of reactions than the sums of individual reaction rates. The TOC removal ranged from 8% to 41% after one hour of reaction, with the above-mentioned order of efficiency. The biodegradability increased rapidly during the early minutes of the reaction. A reaction time of 10-15 min was sufficient for near maximum biodegradability, making these processes good pretreatments for the biological processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Yeungnam University, 214-1 Dae-dong, Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do 712-749, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "M Hammad", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Hee-Suk", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Wontae", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jin-Young", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WCK1KIQ23Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlortetracycline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlortetracycline"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23530364", "10.1080/09593330.2012.701332"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
