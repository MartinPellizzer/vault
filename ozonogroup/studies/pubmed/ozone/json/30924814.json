The complexed metal cannot be effectively removed by traditional precipitation without decomplexing. In this work, four ozone-based advanced oxidation processes, O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/UV and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV to decomplex electroplating wastewater were investigated and their performance compared. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citric acid are the most common components of electroplating wastewater. They were used as representatives to study the decomplexation and mineralization of complexes in the ozone-based advanced oxidation processes. Among all, the highest degradation and mineralization efficiency of EDTA occurred in O<sub>3</sub>/UV and was 65% and 53% in 60 min, respectively. For citric acid, the highest degradation (77%) and mineralization (56%) efficiency was observed in the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV process. This indicates that selection of the advanced oxidation process is determined by the target contaminant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Water Resource Application and Environmental Pollution Control, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China E-mail: xiaolei.zhang2016@foxmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhuoyue", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Water Resource Application and Environmental Pollution Control, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China E-mail: xiaolei.zhang2016@foxmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Water Resource Application and Environmental Pollution Control, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China E-mail: xiaolei.zhang2016@foxmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Water Resource Application and Environmental Pollution Control, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China E-mail: xiaolei.zhang2016@foxmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaolei", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji Zhun Fang Zhong Architectural Design Co., Ltd, Zhengzhou Branch, Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jiangyu", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electroplating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metallurgy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30924814", "10.2166/wcc.2018.167"]}}]}
