Dissemination of these two ARGs in drinking water supply systems and their effect on healthy gut bacteria are poorly studied. In this study, the dissemination of mcr-1 and bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> in a drinking water supply system, and their effect on the antibiotic resistance of mouse gut bacteria are explored. Metagenome analysis revealed that source water (Taipu river and Jinze reservoir) was polluted with ARGs. Mcr-1 and bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> can be disseminated through the water distribution system. Even advanced water treatments (ozone and biological activated carbon (BAC)) could not effectively remove mcr-1 and bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>. Low concentrations of chloramine disinfectants in the water distribution system were not effective at limiting ARG abundance. Mobile genetic elements were also found to play a major role in the dissemination of ARGs via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) throughout the water supply system. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no effect of temperature on the abundance of mcr-1 and bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> throughout the water supply system. A last resort ARG, mcr-1 can disseminate from drinking water to the healthy mouse gut. The presence of mcr-1 in a strain belonging to Enterococcus hirae, which is different from the strain belonging to the Bacillus cereus group isolated from drinking water, strongly supports the phenomena of HGT inside the gut. This research provides novel insights into the role of drinking water in disseminating ARGs to the gut and strongly suggests that drinking water may also play a major role apart from other factors known to be involved in the prevalence of last resort ARGs in the gut."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
