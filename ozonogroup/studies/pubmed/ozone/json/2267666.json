Exposure to high concentrations of ozone produces a variety of toxic effects in the lung, but it is not known to what extent prolonged exposure to low concentrations of ozone may contribute to the development of chronic lung disease. Phospholipids, important components of cellular membranes and surfactant, are necessary for the maintenance of normal lung structure and function. In order to test the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of ozone on phospholipid metabolism in the lung, rats were exposed to clean air or to 0.12, 0.25 or 0.50 ppm ozone for up to 18 months. The content and biosynthesis of phospholipids in both lung tissue and bronchopulmonary lavage fluid (surfactant) were measured. Incorporation of [14C]acetate into lung tissue phospholipids, an estimate of overall biosynthesis, decreased significantly at some time points in the study, while tissue phospholipid content tended to increase with both ozone concentration and with age. No changes were detected in phospholipid content of bronchopulmonary lavage fluid. These findings did not support the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of rats to environmentally relevant concentrations of ozone results in either qualitative or quantitative deficits in the pulmonary surfactant system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI 48009."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smiler", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2267666", "10.1016/0300-483x(90)90123-x", "0300-483X(90)90123-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
