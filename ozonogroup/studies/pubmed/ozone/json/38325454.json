Air pollution data from four national fixed monitoring stations were collected to estimate exposure level in Xiangyang City. A quasi-Poisson generalized additive model incorporating a distributed lag nonlinear model was applied to evaluate the association between air pollution and CVD risk. The potential modification effect of sex, age, and season on the above associations was also evaluated.", "CVD risk was positively associated with air pollution.
