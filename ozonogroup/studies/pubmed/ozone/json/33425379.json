Traditional data assimilation or fusion methods are mainly focused on individual pollutants, and thus cannot support simultaneous assimilation for both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. To fill the gap, this study proposed a novel multipollutant assimilation method by using an emission-concentration response model (noted as RSM-assimilation). The new method was successfully applied to assimilate precursors for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the 28 cities of the North China Plain (NCP). By adjusting emissions of five pollutants (i.e., NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, VOC and primary PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the 28 cities through RSM-assimilation, the RMSEs (root mean square errors) of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were reduced by about 35% and 58% from the original simulations. The RSM-assimilation results small sensitivity to the number of observation sites due to the use of prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of emissions; however, the ability to assimilate concentrations at the edge of the control region is limited. The emission ratios of five pollutants were simultaneously adjusted during the RSM-assimilation, indicating that the emission inventory may underestimate NO<sub>2</sub> in January, April and October, and SO<sub>2</sub> in April, but overestimate NH<sub>3</sub> in April and VOC in January and October. Primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions are also significantly underestimated, particularly in April (dust season in NCP). Future work should focus on expanding the control area and including NH<sub>3</sub> observations to improve the RSM-assimilation performance and emission inventories."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Siwei", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Dian", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "James T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuxiao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Carey", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Jiming", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Atmosphere (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101562250", "ISSNLinking": "2073-4433"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.
