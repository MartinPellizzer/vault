The data were obtained using polarized laser photodissociation coupled with resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization and velocity-map ion imaging. Under the jet-cooled conditions employed, absorption is believed to be dominated by excitation into the Herzberg continuum. The experimental data are compared with previous experiments and theoretical calculations at this and other wavelengths. Semi-classical calculations performed by Groenenboom and van Vroonhoven [J. Chem. Phys, 2002, 116, 1965] are used to estimate the alignment parameters arising from incoherent excitation and dissociation and these are shown to agree qualitatively well with the available experimental data. Following the work of Alexander et al. [J. Chem. Phys, 2003, 118, 10566], orientation and alignment parameters arising from coherent excitation and dissociation are modelled more approximately by estimating phase differences generated subsequent to dissociation via competing adiabatic pathways leading to the same asymptotic products. These calculations lend support to the view that large values of the coherent alignment moments, but small values of the corresponding orientation moments, could arise from coherent excitation of (and subsequent dissociation via) parallel and perpendicular components of the Herzberg I, II and III transitions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, The Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, South Parks Road, Oxford, UK. mark.brouard@chem.ox.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brouard", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cireasa", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quadrini", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vallance", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anisotropy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematical Computing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17136270", "10.1039/b612460g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
