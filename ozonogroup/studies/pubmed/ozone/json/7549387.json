The results showed that the production of IL-2 decreased, the content of LPO increased and the activity of catalase (CAT) declined in old mice. After medication of BWDKD the above-mentioned indices were modulated. The ozone inhaled mice revealed similar changes of aging in the above indices. After BWDKD administration, the content of LPO decreased, meanwhile, the activity of CAT and IL-2 were strengthened and showed linear correlation. It was discovered that the production of IL-2 decreased significantly after adding H2O2 into the culture of splenic lymphocytes, but when BWDKD was added simultaneously, the IL-2 production was restored to the level of control group, in which no H2O2 was added. The results suggested that the modulating effect of BWDKD on immune senescence was closely related with the improvement of free radical metabolism, and it provided a partial evidence for the viewpoint of \"Vitality deficiency with blood stasis is the principal mechanism of senescence\"."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Medical University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "W Y", "Initials": "WY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7549387"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
