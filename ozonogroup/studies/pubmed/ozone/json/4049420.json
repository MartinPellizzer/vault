Animals were given air alone 5 to 7 days before and after the 5 days of O3 exposure. The elimination half-life of theophylline was significantly (p = 0.004) prolonged on Days 1 and 5 of O3 exposure in the rabbits greater than 2 years old, with no effect being seen in those 3 to 4 months old. No O3-induced change was seen in the apparent volume of distribution to account for the observed change in theophylline elimination half-life. The female rabbit in particular demonstrated this age-related effect; while in the male, variability prevented the observed difference from reaching significance. The results indicated inhibition of theophylline elimination by O3 in the rabbit depends on age and sex."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Canada", "ForeName": "A T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calabrese", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C137DTR5RG", "NameOfSubstance": "Theophylline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Theophylline"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4049420", "10.1016/0041-008x(85)90118-8", "0041-008X(85)90118-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
