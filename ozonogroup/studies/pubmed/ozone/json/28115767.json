Parameters taken into account were: microbiological (Total viable count, <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp., Lactic acid bacteria, Yeasts and molds, and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>), physicochemical (pH, colour) and sensory (odor, appearance, texture, and taste) attributes. Results showed that colour parameter values (<i>L*, a*,</i> and <i>b*</i>) were not affected by the gaseous ozone dose, whereas only <i>L*</i> and <i>b*</i> were reduced during storage in all samples. pH was reduced by storage time but was not affected by ozonation dose and packaging. Total viable count and <i>Pseudomonas spp.</i>, increased statistically significant with ozonation dose and storage time, but were not affected by packaging. Yeasts, molds, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and Lactic acid bacteria, were decreased during storage, packaging and ozonation dose. Finally, sensory examination (appearance, texture, odor and taste) showed that samples treated with ozone concentration of 10\u00a0mg/L retained the original characteristic features of fresh chicken legs as compared to the control samples. The gaseous ozone treatment of 10\u00a0mg/L for 1\u00a0h, to chicken legs packaged in plastic containers of polyamide/polyethylene under refrigeration, is appropriate for maintaining freshness and quality of chicken, since their shelf life was extended by 4\u00a0days, as compared to the control samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Technology, Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece."}], "LastName": "Gertzou", "ForeName": "Ioanna N", "Initials": "IN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Technology, Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece."}], "LastName": "Drosos", "ForeName": "Panagiotis E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Technology, Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece."}], "LastName": "Karabagias", "ForeName": "Ioannis K", "Initials": "IK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Technology, Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece."}], "LastName": "Riganakos", "ForeName": "Kyriakos A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Food Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0056471", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1155"}, "CoiStatement": "Compliance with ethical requirements Conflicts of interest All authors declare that they do not have financial, academic, commercial, political or personal interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Adu-Gyamfi A, Torgby-Tetteh W, Appiah V.
