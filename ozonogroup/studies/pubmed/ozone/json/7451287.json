Dose-response curves of mean pulmonary flow resistance (RL) to carbachol were obtained by measuring RL after five breaths of carbachol aerosol with stepwise increases in drug concentration. The animals then breathed 0.5 ppm O3 through an endotracheal tube for 2 h. The dose-response curves were repeated immediately after the 0.5 ppm O3 exposure and 24 h later. In the eight sheep studied, there were no significant alterations in base-line RL immediately after or 24 h after 0.5 ppm O3. Airway hyperreactivity was not apparent immediately after the sheep breathed 0.5 ppm O3, but it was evident 24 h later. In contrast, six sheep that breathed 0.5 ppm O3 in the same manner for 2 h did not show a significant depression in tracheal mucous velocity the same day or 24 h later. Exposure to 1 ppm O3 for 2 h resulted in airway hyperreactivity immediately after the exposure and elevated base-line RL 24 h later; 2 ppm O3 produced an increase in base-line RL immediately after exposure. We conclude that, in conscious sheep, airway hyperreactivity appears to be a more sensitive indicator of airway effects produced by short-term exposure to 0.5 ppm O3 than depression of tracheal mucous velocity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abraham", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Januszkiewicz", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mingle", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Welker", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wanner", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sackner", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-20989", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8Y164V895Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbachol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbachol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mucous Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7451287", "10.1152/jappl.1980.48.5.789"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
