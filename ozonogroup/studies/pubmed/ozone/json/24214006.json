The monitoring sites were included along the prevailing wind patterns in Karachi. Carbon monoxide levels in the ambient air were found to reach 9-10 ppm along the busy urban streets whereas CO2 level exceeded 370 ppm in these areas. Our survey indicates that NO2 levels were exceeding U.S. ambient air quality standards. Maxmum NO2 concentrations were observed (0.3-0.5 ppm) during the daytime from 0600 h to 2100 h. The surface ozone maximum around noon at the inland sites reached the levels of 40 ppb and 50 ppb respectively compared to upwind coastal Sites 1 level of 25 ppb. The Pb concentrations were approximately 3- to 7-fold higher than average, which corresponded well to urban air. Fossil fuel SO4 (excess) and NO3 were apportionally based on the assumption that these two anions were present as (NH4)2SO4, and NH4NO3 in the aerosols. In the eastern part of the city atmospheric sulphate (SO4) shows the combustion of coal as its source from the vicinity and downwind of a steel manufacturing plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), University Road, P.O.
