The process analysis was conducted by using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System Community Multiscale Air Quality (RAMS-CMAQ) model to investigate photochemical production and the vertical transport mechanism of boundary-layer O<sub>3</sub> during a typical O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode in the North China Plain (NCP), and further quantify the contribution of vertical transport to surface O<sub>3</sub>. The diurnal variations of vertical budgets of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in the boundary layer at multiple sites showed that there were substantial differences in the vertical distribution of O<sub>3</sub> production and transport between urban and suburban/rural areas. In urban areas, surface O<sub>3</sub> is consumed by titration reaction to generate NO<sub>2</sub>, which is then transported to the upper boundary layer and produces O<sub>3</sub> by photochemical reaction. With the development of the boundary layer, the upper-layer O<sub>3</sub> stored in the residual layer at nighttime can be transported vertically to the surface as the turbulent diffusion intensifies the next morning. While in suburban and rural areas, the vertical transport is relatively weaker because the photochemical formation of O<sub>3</sub> occurs in the whole boundary layer, although it decreases slightly with the altitude. Model simulation showed that 20.6-27.9% of urban surface O<sub>3</sub> changes in the morning (09:00-10:00 LST) was attributable to the downward transport from the residual layer, while it is 15.0-22.1% at suburban site. The vertical transport from above the boundary layer contributed 24.0-63.6% to daytime urban surface O<sub>3</sub> changes, which was weak in suburban areas. Differences and similarities in O<sub>3</sub> formation and transport mechanism in urban and suburban regions revealed here highlight the importance of earlier control and regional collaboration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
