In this work, we investigate the effect of salts on the performance of the catalytic ozonation process for treatment of synthetic ROC using a commercially available Fe-loaded Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst. Our results show that the presence of salts influences the rate and extent of degradation of organic compounds present in the synthetic ROC when subjected to the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process. Scavenging of aqueous O<sub>3</sub> by chloride ions and/or transformation of organics (particularly humics) to more hydrophobic form as a result of charge shielding between adjacent functional groups and/or intramolecular binding by cations inhibits the bulk oxidation of organics to a measurable extent. While the scavenging of aqueous hydroxyl radicals at the salt concentrations investigated here was minimal, the accumulation of chloride ions in the electric double layer near the catalyst surface, particularly when pH<\u00a0pH<sub>pzc</sub>, results in more significant scavenging of surface associated hydroxyl radicals. Overall, the presence of salts (particularly chloride ions) has a significant influence on the performance of both conventional and catalytic ozonation processes with some scope to mitigate this effect through appropriate choice of catalyst."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
