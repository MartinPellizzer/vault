The rice-wheat cropping system occupying 26 million ha of productive land in Asia could be a major source of N2O as most of the fertilizer N in this region is consumed by this system. Emission of N2O as influenced by application of urea, urea plus farm yard manure (FYM), and urea plus dicyandiamide (DCD), a nitrification inhibitor, was studied in rice-wheat systems of Indo-Gangetic plains of India. Total emission of N2O-N from the rice-wheat systems varied between 654 g ha(-1) in unfertilized plots and 1,570 g ha(-1) in urea fertilized plots. Application of FYM and DCD reduced emission of N2O-N in rice. The magnitude of reduction was higher with DCD. In wheat also N2O-N emission was reduced by DCD. FYM applied in rice had no residual effect on N2O-N emission in wheat. In rice intermittent wetting and drying condition of soil resulted in higher N2O-N emission than that of saturated soil condition. Treatments with 5 irrigations gave higher emissions in wheat than those with 3 irrigations. In rice-wheat system, typical of a farmer's field in Indo-Gangetic plains, where 240 kg N is generally applied through urea, N2O-N emission is 1,570 g ha(-1) (0.38% of applied N) and application of FYM and DCD reduced it to 1,415 and 1,096 g ha(-1), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Sciences, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. him_ensc@iari.ernet.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pathak", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhatia", "ForeName": "Arti", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Shiv", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Shalini", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jain", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M9B1R0C16H", "NameOfSubstance": "dicyandiamido"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Guanidines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1990 Jun 8;248(4960):1217-9", "ArticleIdList": ["17809907"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12180654", "10.1023/a:1015823919405"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
