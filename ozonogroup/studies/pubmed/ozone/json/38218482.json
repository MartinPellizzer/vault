In the summer of 2022, abnormal warming spread over most of the Northern Hemisphere and resulted in the abnormal increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. In this study, we focused on the coastal cities in China and investigated the O<sub>3</sub> trends in July during 2015 to 2022. Four regions with different locations and emission levels were selected for comparison. A significant increase of O<sub>3</sub> concentration in July 2022 were observed in the southern coastal cities (16.7-22.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) while the opposite characteristics were found in the northern coastal cities (decrease of 0.26-2.18\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>). The results indicated various distribution patterns of the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations responded to heat wave across China. The weakening of East Asian summer monsoon, extension of the western Pacific subtropical high, significant warming, stronger solar radiation, lower relative humidity, less rainfall and sinking motion of atmosphere in 2022 were beneficial for O<sub>3</sub> generation and accumulation in the southern coastal areas. Meteorological changes in July 2022 could lead to an increase of 15.6\u00a0% in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in southern coastal cities compared to that in 2015-2021, based on the analysis of machine learning. Air temperature was the main contributor to high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the coast of Fujian province, while other coastal cities depended on relative humidity. This study indicated the challenge of O<sub>3</sub> pollution control in coastal areas under global warming, especially in extreme heat wave events."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
