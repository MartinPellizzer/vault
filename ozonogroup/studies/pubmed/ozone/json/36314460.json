Field studies suggest that indoor sources of ROS contribute to measured ROS on PM in indoor air. We hypothesize that ozone reacts on indoor surfaces to form semi-volatile ROS, in particular organic peroxides (OPX), which partition to airborne particles. To test this hypothesis, we modeled ozone-induced formation of OPX, its decay and its partitioning to PM in a residential building and compared the results to field measurements. Simulations indicate that, while ROS of outdoor origin is the primary contributor to indoor ROS (in PM), a substantial fraction of ROS present in indoor PM is from ozone-surface chemistry. At an air change rate equal to 1/h, and an outdoor ozone mixing ratio of 35 ppb, 25% of the ROS concentration in air is due to indoor formation and partitioning of OPX to PM. For the same conditions, but with a modest indoor source of PM (1.5 mg h<sup>-1</sup>), 44% of indoor ROS on PM is of indoor origin. An indoor source of ozone, such as an electrostatic air cleaner, also increases OPX present in indoor PM. The results of the simulations support the hypothesis that ozone-induced formation of OPX on indoor surfaces, and subsequent partitioning to aerosols, is sufficient to explain field observations. Therefore, indoor sourced ROS could contribute meaningfully to total inhaled PM-ROS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6876-7185"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA. glenn.morrison@unc.edu."}], "LastName": "Morrison", "ForeName": "Glenn C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0878-9969"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA."}], "LastName": "Eftekhari", "ForeName": "Azin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2923-4073"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California Irvine, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Lakey", "ForeName": "Pascale S J", "Initials": "PSJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2532-5373"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California Irvine, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Shiraiwa", "ForeName": "Manabu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1350-6380"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Cummings", "ForeName": "Bryan E", "Initials": "BE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1864-9268"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Waring", "ForeName": "Michael S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Aerosol Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Brent", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36314460", "10.1039/d2em00307d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
