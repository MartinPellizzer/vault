Resin coated APC brackets (3M) were bonded according to the manufacturers' instructions. Bonded teeth were randomly divided into two groups. The teeth in Group 1 were subjected to a 10-second dosage of ozone from the HealOzone unit (Kavo) after etching and to a further 10 seconds of ozone after bonding the brackets using a 5 mm delivery cup. Teeth in Group 2 were used as a control. Debonding was carried out using a testing instrument at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/minute.", "The Mann-Whitney test revealed no significant differences in shear bond strength between the two groups (P = 0.337). The mean shear bond strength (11.66 MPa) of Group 1 (subjected to ozone) was not significantly different than the mean shear bond strength (10.88 MPa) of Group 2 (not subjected to ozone). A Pearson Chi-square test of the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) revealed no significant difference in residual adhesive among the groups tested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Restorative Department, School of Dentistry, Queen's University, Grosvenor Rd., Belfast, Northern Ireland BT12 6BP, United Kingdom. alshamsiamna@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al Shamsi", "ForeName": "Amna Hassan", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cunningham", "ForeName": "James Leo", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lamey", "ForeName": "Philip-John", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8806701", "ISSNLinking": "0894-8275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "accelerated Portland cement"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acid Etching, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Cements"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Debonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orthodontic Brackets"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Replica Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Shear Strength"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Mechanical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18435374"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
