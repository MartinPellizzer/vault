However, obtaining excellent optoelectrical properties and mechanical flexibility of FTMEs is challenging because ultrathin metal layers usually follow an island growth mode. In this paper, flexible transparent ultrathin Ag electrodes with high mechanical stability and good optoelectrical properties were exploited by tailoring the surface properties of plastic substrates with ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment for regulating the nucleation and growth kinetics of Ag films. The composite transparent electrodes of Ag (9 nm)/MoO<sub>3</sub> (20 nm) fabricated on the UVO-treated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates possess a low sheet resistance of \u223c7.9 \u03a9/sq, a high optical transmittance of \u223c87.2% at 550 nm, a long-period environmental stability of 30 days (\u223c65 \u00b0C, \u223c80% humidity), and excellent mechanical flexibility of 100,000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 1.5 mm. These properties are derived from the surface treatment of PET substrates by UVO, which increases substrate surface energy and produces chemical nucleation sites of the phenolic hydroxyl groups. The phenolic hydroxyl groups generated on the PET surface not only provided efficient nucleation sites for subsequent Ag film growth but also formed C-O-Ag bonds between the substrate surface and the Ag layer, which act as \"anchor chains\" to fix firmly the Ag atoms on the substrate surface. As a universal applicability strategy, the composite electrodes on the UVO-treated polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and norland optical adhesive 63 (NOA63) substrates also possess excellent optoelectrical properties and mechanical flexibility. Based on the ultrathin Ag composite electrodes, the flexible white organic light-emitting devices with PET, PEN, and NOA63 as substrates present the maximum current efficiencies of 53.0, 77.0, and 65.2 cd/A, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Wenjuan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ruiting", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ruiqing", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yeyang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qianqian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yuehua", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2381-1570"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Wenyong", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8321-3006"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xinwen", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36475577", "10.1021/acsami.2c18738"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
