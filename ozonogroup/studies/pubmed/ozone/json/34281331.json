A 54-year-old woman presented with bilateral lesion in the zygomatic region, caused by treatment with hyaluronidase and laser for removal of a granuloma, developed after infiltration with hyaluronate. The lesion was treated by local application of platelet-rich plasma obtained with CGF centrifuge, and containing CD34+ cells, mixed and activated by ozone in a 1:1 proportion, at a concentration of 40 mg/ml for 30 sec, in a syringe. Five consecutive bilateral infiltrations were made at 3-week intervals. Lesion volume was measured, and patient's quality of life was assessed with PGWBI (Psychological General Well Being Index) questionnaire. After the third infiltration of CGF-ozone, a consistent reduction of the lesion was observed, until disappearance at the end of the treatment. The result was maintained after 4-year follow-up. Considerable improvement of patient's well-being was reported. This case report showed that CGF-ozone combined therapy may promote dermal regeneration, achieving excellent facial esthetics outcomes. This result needs to be confirmed by further studies with a larger sample size."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Private practice, Mirandola, (MO), Italy."}], "LastName": "Pederzoli", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory in Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering, Saint Camillus International University of Health Sciences, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Greco Lucchina", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Dental Clinic, Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Del Fabbro", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory in Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering, Saint Camillus International University of Health Sciences, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mortellaro", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Esthetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Granuloma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34281331", "10.23812/21-2supp1-34", "34"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
