The profiles of six HAcAms and their formation potentials (FPs) upon chlorination at water purification plant 1 (WPP-1) in September 2016 and at WPP-2 in September 2016 and January 2017 were investigated. HAcAms were removed effectively when they were formed via intermediate chlorination during water purification processes. Removal of total HAcAm-FPs ranged from 50% to 75%. Coagulation/flocculation/sand filtration showed the highest removal of total HAcAm-FPs. As for individual HAcAms, while chlorinated acetamide-FPs were removed, brominated acetamide-FPs, particularly 2,2-dibromoacetamide, remained. The bromine incorporation factors increased during all water purification processes except ozonation and the ozone/hydrogen peroxide process for diHAcAms (2,2-dichloroacetamide, 2-bromo-2-chloroacetamide, and 2,2-dibromoacetamide). The trends in relationships between DOM indices (fractions of dissolved organic matter, ultraviolet absorbance at 260\u202fnm, and fluorescence intensities representing humic-like and tryptophan-like compounds) and total HAcAm-FPs during ozonation and ozone/hydrogen peroxide process were different from those during other processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
