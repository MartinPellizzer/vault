An Aerodyne soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) was deployed at a downwind site of downtown Nanjing to investigate the chemical composition, sources, and size distribution of submicron aerosols (PM<sub>1</sub>), in response to emission control policies. However, results show that emission controls played a negligible role in reducing PM<sub>1</sub> concentration during the YOG period, yet primary precursors such as NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> were decreased by 10-20%. Low wind speed, high relative humidity, and high ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration likely play a significant role in the production and accumulation of the oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) and the secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) in summer Nanjing. We propose that long-term regional emission reduction could be a solution for future air pollution mitigation strategies in downwind cities of the YRD region, and that seasonal meteorological characteristics in a specific region should be considered before emission control policies are made."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
