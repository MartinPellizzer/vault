Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs) and Chromosomal Aberrations (CAs) assays, as well as genotyping of GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes, were performed.", "Mean values of SCEs and CAs were 5.137\u2009\u00b1\u20090.166 and 0.018\u2009\u00b1\u20090.002, respectively. Results showed age and gender associated with higher frequencies of these two cytogenetic markers. The eldest subjects (51-65 years) showed significantly higher levels of genomic damage than younger individuals. GSTs polymorphisms did not appear to significantly influence the frequencies of either markers.", "The CAs background frequency observed in this study is one of the highest reported among European populations.
