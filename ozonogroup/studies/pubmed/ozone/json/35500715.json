Public and regulatory authorities are concerned and placing joint efforts to eliminate estrogens and related environmentally hazardous compounds, due to their toxic influences on the environmental matrices, ecology, and human health, even at low concentrations. However, most of the available literature is focused on the occurrence of estrogens in different water environments with limited treatment options. Thus, a detailed review to fully cover the several treatment processes is needed. This review comprehensively and comparatively discusses many physical, chemical, and biological-based treatments to eliminate natural estrogens, i.e., estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3) and related synthetic estrogens, e.g., 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and other related hazardous compounds. The covered techniques include adsorption, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, ultrasonication, photocatalysis of estrogenic compounds, Fenton, Fenton-like and photo-Fenton degradation of estrogenic compounds, electro-Fenton degradation of estrogenic compounds, ozonation, and biological methods for the removal of estrogenic compounds are thoroughly discussed with suitable examples. The studies revealed that treatment plants based on chemical and biological approaches are cost-friendly for removing estrogenic pollutants. Further, there is a need to properly monitor and disposal of the usage of estrogenic drugs in humans and animals. Additional studies are required to explore a robust and more advanced oxidation treatment strategy that can contribute effectively to industrial-scale applications. This review may assist future investigations, monitoring, and removing estrogenic compounds from various environmental matrices. In concluding remarks, a way forward and future perspectives focusing on bridging knowledge gaps in estrogenic compounds removal are also proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
