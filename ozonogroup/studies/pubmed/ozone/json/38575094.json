However, enzyme manufacturing significantly impacts the environment through dependence on traditional feedstocks. With the objective of determining the environmental impacts of enzyme production, the sustainability potential of six cradle-to-gate enzyme manufacturing systems focusing on glucose, sea lettuce, acetate, straw, and phototrophic growth, was thoroughly evaluated. Human and ecosystem toxicity categories dominated the overall impacts. Sea lettuce, straw, or phototrophic growth reduces fermentation-based emissions by 51.0, 63.7, and 79.7%, respectively. Substituting glucose-rich media demonstrated great potential to reduce marine eutrophication, land use, and ozone depletion. Replacing organic nitrogen sources with inorganic ones could further lower these impacts. Location-specific differences in electricity result in a 14% and a 27% reduction in the carbon footprint for operation in Denmark compared to the US and China. Low-impact feedstocks can be competitive if they manage to achieve substrate utilization rates and productivity levels of conventional enzyme production processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
