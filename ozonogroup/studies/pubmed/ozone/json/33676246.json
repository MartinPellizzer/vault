Direct oxidation of As(III) by chemical oxidants, such as ozone, permanganate, ferrate, chlorine and chloramine, or naturally occurring minerals like Mn, Fe oxides, seems straightforward. Both O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are ineffective for arsenite oxidation, but they can be activated by reducing substances like Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>0</sup> to increase the oxidation rates. Photo-induced oxidation of As(III) has been demonstrated effective in Fe complexes or minerals, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, dissolved organic matter (DOM), peroxygens and TiO<sub>2</sub> systems. Although a variety of oxidation methods have been developed over the past two decades, there remain many scientific and technical challenges that must be overcome before the rapid progress in basic knowledge can be translated into environmental benefits. To better understand the trends in the existing data and to identify the knowledge gaps, this review describes in detail the complicated mechanisms for As(III) oxidation by various methods and emphasizes on the conflicting data and explanation. Some prevailing concerns and challenges in the sphere of As(III) oxidation are also pointed out so as to appeal to researchers for further investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
