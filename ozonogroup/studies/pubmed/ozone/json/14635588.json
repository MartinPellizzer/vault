The number of children with sunburns during each Summer was compared with the corresponding UV-B radiation and the ozone thickness, to establish a probable relation between a geophysical change and its consequences in skin health. The ozone layer values were obtained from the NASA WEB-page and the ultraviolet radiation was measured with a four-channel medium resolution radiometer.", "In each Summer there was a predominance of sunburns among boys and among ages between 6 and 10 years. During the 96-97 Austral Summer, the highest number of children with sunburns (63) was diagnosed. That Summer also had the highest mean UV-305 nm radiation with an important amount of days with ozone < or = 260 Dobson Units. Only during that Summer an inverse correlation between ozone and UV-305 nm radiation was detected. At the same time the maximal values of Erythemal Dose Rate (33 muWatt cm2), UV Index (13) and Erythemal Daily Dose (7.500 Joule m2) were observed.", "In Santiago, Summers with a higher number of days with low ozone protection seem to reappear every 3 years. Understanding the interaction of physical processes that control the ozone layer, may help to design better photo-protection programs for human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fundaci\u00f3n de Ayuda al Ni\u00f1o Quemado, Departamento de Dermatolog\u00eda, Hospital Cl\u00ednico, Universidad de Chile."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aranibar", "ForeName": "Ligia", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cabrera", "ForeName": "Sergio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Honeyman", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Menores quemados por el sol y su relaci\u00f3n con la radiaci\u00f3n ultravioleta y la cubierta de ozono, durante seis veranos (1996 a 2001) en Santiago de Chile (33, 5 degrees S)."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Chile", "MedlineTA": "Rev Med Chil", "NlmUniqueID": "0404312", "ISSNLinking": "0034-9887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sunburn"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14635588"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
