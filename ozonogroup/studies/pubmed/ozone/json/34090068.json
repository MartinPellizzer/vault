Therefore, the contribution of VOCs to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation at a receptor site is different from that in a source area. In this study, hourly concentrations of VOCs and other pollutants, such as O<sub>3</sub>, NOx, HONO, CO, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, were measured in the suburbs (Daxing district) of Beijing in August 2019. The photochemical initial concentrations (PICs), in which the photochemical losses of VOCs were accounted for, were calculated to evaluate the contribution of the VOCs to O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation. The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) measured VOC concentrations and the PICs were 11.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 and 14.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4\u00a0ppbv, respectively, which correspond to O<sub>3</sub> formation potentials (OFP) of 57.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.3 and 103.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0109.4\u00a0ppbv and SOA formation potentials (SOAP) of 8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1 and 10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Alkenes contributed 80.5% of the consumed VOCs, followed by aromatics (13.3%) and alkanes (6.2%). The contributions of the alkenes and aromatics to the OFP<sub>PICs</sub> were 56.8% and 30.3%, respectively; while their corresponding contributions to the SOAP<sub>PICs</sub> were 1.9% and 97.3%, respectively. The OFP<sub>PICs</sub> was linearly correlated with the observed O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (OFP<sub>PICs</sub>\u00a0=\u00a041.5\u00a0+\u00a01.40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0c<sub>O3</sub>, R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.87). The O<sub>3</sub> formation was associated with a VOC-limited regime at the receptor site based on the measured VOCs and changed to a transition regime and a NOx sensitive regime based on the PIC. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to biogenic VOCs when studying O<sub>3</sub> formation in summer in Beijing, while the control of anthropogenic aromatic compounds should be given priority in terms of SOA formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
