However, indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from different rivers, particularly for those that drain completely different landscapes, are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatial-temporal variability of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions among the different rivers in the Chaohu Lake Basin of Eastern China. Our results showed that river reaches in urban watersheds are the hotspots of N<sub>2</sub>O production, with a mean N<sub>2</sub>O concentration of \u223c410\u00a0nmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, which is 9-18 times greater than those mainly draining forested (23\u00a0nmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>), agricultural (42\u00a0nmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) and mixed (45\u00a0nmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) landscapes. Riverine dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O was generally supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. Such N<sub>2</sub>O saturation can best be explained by nitrogen availability, except for those in the forested watersheds, where dissolved oxygen is thought to be the primary predictor. The estimated N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes in urban rivers reached \u223c471\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, a value of \u223c22, 13, and 11 times that in forested, agricultural and mixed watersheds, respectively. Averaged riverine N<sub>2</sub>O emission factors (EF<sub>5r</sub>) of the forested, agricultural, urban and mixed watersheds were 0.066%, 0.12%, 0.95% and 0.16%, respectively, showing different deviations from the default EF<sub>5r</sub> that released by IPCC in 2019. This points to a need for more field measurements with wider spatial coverage and finer frequency to further refine the EF<sub>5r</sub> and to better reveal the mechanisms behind indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions as influenced by watershed landscapes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
