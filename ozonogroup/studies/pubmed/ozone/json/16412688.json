Almost all bottlers used multiple treatment procedures such as microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ozonization to treat the water. Around 40% of the samples exceeded the limit of 100 cfu/ml set by the department of health as well as Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Government of India. Fourteen percent and 44% of the samples with THB loads between 100 and 1000 cfu/ml or 1000 cfu/ml tested positive for coliforms indicating a linear relationship between THB and coliform bacteria. Gram-positive genera such as Kurthia and Corynebacterium were found to be dominant genera, while members of the family enterobacteriaceae contributed to 7%. Risk assessment of the heterotrophic bacteria revealed that the majority of the strains acquired resistance against ampicillin, nalidixic acid, novobiocin and oxytetracycline. As bottled drinking water is a ready to drink commodity, the high load of heterotrophic bacteria with multiple drug resistance poses significant health hazards to the consumers, especially to immunocompromised individuals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeena", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deepa", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mujeeb Rahiman", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shanthi", "ForeName": "R T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hatha", "ForeName": "A A M", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Int J Hyg Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "100898843", "ISSNLinking": "1438-4639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mineral Waters"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Mineral Waters"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16412688", "10.1016/j.ijheh.2005.11.003", "S1438-4639(05)00138-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
