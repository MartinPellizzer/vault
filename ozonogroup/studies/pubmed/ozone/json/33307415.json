The behavior of the system in terms of the effect of independent variables on diuron was investigated and optimized by RSM-CCD and ANN-GA methods. Both approaches proved to have a very good performance in the modeling of the process and determined the optimum condition of the independent variables as follows: initial pH\u00a0=\u00a010, applied current\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0mA, supporting electrolyte\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u00a0M, ozone concentration\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and reaction time\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0min. The 3D/E-peroxone process achieved a synergistic effect in diuron abatement and reduced significantly energy consumption, as compared to its individual components. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration generated in the electrolysis system was notably increased in the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub>-GAC microparticles. The BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD ratio of the real pesticide wastewater increased from 0.049 to 0.571 within 90\u00a0min treatment. Giving to the considerable enhancement of the biodegradability of the wastewater, this study strongly suggests that the 3D/E-peroxone process can be considered as a promising pretreatment step before a biological treatment process to produce intermediates which are more easily degradable by microorganisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
