In the triggered canister method, a canister sample is collected when a total non-methane organic compound (TNMOC) concentration exceeds a pre-determined trigger level. The canister sample is then analyzed in a lab in a later time. In the Auto-GC method, an online GC runs in a \"continuous\" mode with a sampling and analysis cycle of 1 h. Within the cycle hour, samples are collected only during the first 40 min. A new approach of Auto-GC running in trigger mode is developed in this study. This new approach uses Auto-GC but operates it in a trigger mode similar to the triggered canister sampling method. Compared to the triggered canister sample method, this system provides near real-time speciated VOC data, which are critical for responding to a high VOC concentration episode. Although the canister system generally costs less, its cost advantage may diminish if trigger events are frequent and the monitoring duration is long. Compared to continuous Auto-GC, triggered GC has its niche--it is better for capturing transient plumes with a small footprint. The continuous GC either misses a transient plume if the plume does not arrive at the sampling site during the sampling cycle or flattens the plume concentration peak by dilution with non-plume air sample. Field experience with this system for fenceline VOC monitoring is presented. The sampling and calibration strategy for trigger mode operation is described. The chromatograph retention time drift issues are discussed. The system performance is evaluated, including the method detection limit, precision and accuracy. The trigger mode configuration for VOC fenceline or near source monitoring in this work proved effective for local and transient plume identification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Providence Engineering and Environmental Group LLC, Baton Rouge, LA 70802, United States. limingzhou@providenceeng.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Liming", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Yousheng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hazlett", "ForeName": "Pamela D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matherne", "ForeName": "Valerie", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0370534", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2670"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17616253", "10.1016/j.aca.2007.05.058", "S0003-2670(07)00993-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
