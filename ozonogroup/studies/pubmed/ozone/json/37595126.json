Further study is needed on the temperature dependences of chlorinated VSLSs relevant to atmospheric conditions. Here, the kinetics of chlorinated VSLSs, such as chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>), dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), dichloroethane (CH<sub>2</sub>ClCH<sub>2</sub>Cl), and trichloroethene (C<sub>2</sub>HCl<sub>3</sub>) reacting with chlorine atoms, were investigated between 180 and 400 K, expanding the range of temperatures relative to previous studies. RRKM/Master Equation and Canonical Variational Transition State Theory were utilized to calculate the rate coefficients using the MultiWell suite of programs. CCSD(T), QCISD(T), and M062X with aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z levels of theory were used to calculate the kinetic parameters. Arrhenius equations obtained from fits to the calculated rate coefficients are <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> = (2.66 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> exp\u202f[(-927 \u00b1 131)/<i>T</i>] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> = (8.99 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup>\u202fexp\u202f[(-957 \u00b1 19)/<i>T</i>] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> = (1.51 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup> exp\u202f[(-714 \u00b1 54)/<i>T</i>] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and <i>k</i><sub>4</sub> = (9.17 \u00b1 1.8) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> exp\u202f[(612 \u00b1 101)/<i>T</i>] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for the reactions of CHCl<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>ClCH<sub>2</sub>Cl, and C<sub>2</sub>HCl<sub>3</sub> with Cl atoms, respectively. The rate coefficients for the reactions of chlorinated VSLSs with Cl atoms from this study are compared with the most recent recommended values from the NASA/JPL and IUPAC evaluations and with literature values. The reactivity trends of the reactions are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7796-0195"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard John A.
