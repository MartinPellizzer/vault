Since 2018, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at CAVE has frequently exceeded the 70 ppbv 8-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard. We examine the influence of regional emissions on O<sub>3</sub> formation using observations of O<sub>3</sub>, nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>\u2009=\u2009NO\u2009+\u2009NO<sub>2</sub>), a suite of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN). Elevated O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors are observed when the wind is from the southeast, the direction of the Permian Basin. We identify 13\u2009days during the July 25 to September 5, 2019 study period when the maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> exceeded 65 ppbv; MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> exceeded 70 ppbv on 5 of these days. The results of a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis are used to identify and attribute source contributions of VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub>. On days when the winds are from the southeast, there are larger contributions from factors associated with primary O&G emissions; and, on high O<sub>3</sub> days, there is more contribution from factors associated with secondary photochemical processing of O&G emissions. The observed ratio of VOCs to NO<sub>x</sub> is consistently high throughout the study period, consistent with NO<sub>x</sub>-limited O<sub>3</sub> production. Finally, all high O<sub>3</sub> days coincide with elevated acyl peroxy nitrate abundances with PPN to PAN ratios\u2009>\u20090.15 ppbv ppbv<sup>-1</sup> indicating that anthropogenic VOC precursors, and often alkanes specifically, dominate the photochemistry.<i>Implications</i>: The results above strongly indicate NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive photochemistry at Carlsbad Caverns National Park indicating that reductions in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions should drive reductions in O<sub>3</sub>. However, the NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitivity is largely driven by emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> into a VOC-rich environment, and a high PPN:PAN ratio and its relationship to O<sub>3</sub> indicate substantial influence from alkanes in the regional photochemistry. Thus, simultaneous reductions in emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> and non-methane VOCs from the oil and gas sector should be considered for reducing O<sub>3</sub> at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Reductions in non-methane VOCs will have the added benefit of reducing formation of other secondary pollutants and air toxics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7151-9756"],
