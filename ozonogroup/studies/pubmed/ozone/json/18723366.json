Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp.), mostly grown in tropical and sub-tropical regions may already be experiencing critical doses of UV-B radiation due to a thinner ozone column in those regions. Better understanding of genotypic variability to UV-B radiation is a prerequisite in developing genotypes tolerant to current and projected changes in UV-B radiation. An experiment was conducted in sunlit, controlled environment chambers to evaluate the sensitivity of cowpea genotypes to a range of UV-B radiation levels. Six cowpea genotypes [Prima, California Blackeye (CB)-5, CB-27, CB-46, Mississippi Pinkeye (MPE) and UCR-193], representing origin of different geographical locations, were grown at 30/22 degrees C day/night temperature from seeding to maturity. Four biologically effective ultraviolet-B radiation treatments of 0 (control), 5, 10, and 15 kJ m(-2)d(-1) were imposed from eight days after emergence to maturity. Significant genotypic variability was observed for UV-B responsiveness of eighteen plant attributes measured. The magnitude of the sensitivity to UV-B radiation also varied among cowpea genotypes. Plants from all genotypes grown in elevated UV-B radiation were significantly shorter in stem and flower lengths and exhibited lower seed yields compared to the plants grown under control conditions. Most of the vegetative parameters, in general, showed a positive response to UV-B, whereas the reproductive parameters exhibited a negative response showing the importance of reproductive characters in determining tolerance of cultivars to UV-B radiation. However, all cultivars, except MPE, behaved negatively to UV-B when a combined response index was derived across parameters and UV-B levels. Based on the combined total stress response index (C-TSRI) calculated as sum of individual vegetative, physiological and reproductive component responses over the UV-B treatments, the genotypes were classified as tolerant (MPE), intermediate (CB-5, CB-46 and UCR-193) and sensitive (CB-27 and Prima) to UV-B radiation. The differences in sensitivity among the cowpea genotypes emphasize the need for selecting or developing genotypes with tolerance to current and projected UV-B radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mississippi State University, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, 32 Creelman Street, Box 9555, Mississippi State, MS 39762, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Shardendu K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Surabhi", "ForeName": "Giridara-Kumar", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "K Raja", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phototrophic Processes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18723366", "10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2008.07.002", "S1011-1344(08)00146-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
