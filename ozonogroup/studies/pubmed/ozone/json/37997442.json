Liver fibrisis results from chronic injury to the liver. If not effectively treated in time, liver fibrosis may transform into liver cirrhosis. MVs are recognized as potential biomarkers and important theraputic tools for a wide sectrum of diseases. Medical ozone has the ability to protect the body against pathological conditions caused by oxidative stress. The influence of ozone and MVs on CCL4 induced liver fibrosis was investigated in this study. Forty-eight adult male albino rats were divided into four equal groups. I control, II CCL4 group, III ozone and IV microvesicles groups. Liver fibrosis was induced in group II, III & IV using 12 SC injections (0.5 ml/kg body weight) of CCL4 dissolved in olive oil twice ber week for weeks. Blood samples were obtained to estimate serum ALT & AST. Liver tissues were processed for measurment of GSH & SOD, light and electron microscopic examination. H&E staine sections og group II showed dilated congested sinusoids and centralveins, mononuclear infiltrations, vacuolations and dark nuclei. Ultrastructurally, group II revealed irregular heterochromatic nuclei of hepatocytes, small scanty mitochondria & vacuolations. Morphometric & statistical analyses were performed. Group III showed some improvement, however, group IV showed more imrovement. The results indicates that MVs caused marked improvement than ozone against CCL4 induced liver damage via antioxidant & antiinflammatory properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Samar R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Mahroky", "ForeName": "Samaa M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel Aal", "ForeName": "Sara Mohamed", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ultrastruct Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8002867", "ISSNLinking": "0191-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesenchymal Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37997442", "10.1080/01913123.2023.2278627"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
