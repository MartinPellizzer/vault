The reaction between S + S(2) \u2192 S(3) has not been reported either experimentally or by theory, but may be a key intermediate step in the formation of sulfur aerosols in low-O(2) atmospheres. In this work, the kinetics of this reaction is reported with Ar gas used as the chaperone molecule in the production of S(3) via two complex intermediates: SAr + S(2) and S(2)Ar + S. Quasi-classical and classical trajectory methods are used. The rate constant of the S + S(2) + Ar \u2192 S(3) + Ar reaction is determined to be 2.66 \u00d7 10(-33) cm(6)\u2009 mol(-1)\u2009s(-1) at 298.15 K. The temperature dependence of the reaction is found to be 2.67 \u00d7 10(-33) exp[143.56(1\u2215T-1\u2215298.15)]. The second-order rate constant of S + S(2) \u2192 S(3) is 6.47 \u00d7 10(-14) cm(3)\u2009molecule(-1)\u2009s(-1) at 298.15 K and the Arrhenius-type rate constant is calculated to be 6.25 \u00d7 10(-14) exp[450.15(1\u2215T-1\u2215298.15)] cm(3)\u2009molecule(-1)\u2009s(-1). This work provides a rate coefficient for a key intermediate species in studies of sulfur formation in the modern Venus atmosphere and the primitive Earth atmosphere, for which assumed model rate coefficients have spanned nearly 4 orders of magnitude. Although a symmetry-induced mass-independent isotope effect is not expected for a chaperone mechanism, the present work is an important step toward evaluating whether mass-independence is expected for thiozone formation as is observed for ozone formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Shiyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Germann", "ForeName": "Timothy C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peterson", "ForeName": "Kirk A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hua-Gen", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lyons", "ForeName": "James R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21513396", "10.1063/1.3572226"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
