These attempts aim to increase aquaculture yield by increasing energy efficiency and decreasing footprint and chemical demand without compromising animal health. For this, emerging nanobubbles (NBs) aeration technology gained attention. NBs are gas-filled pockets suspended as sphere-like cavities (bulk NBs) or attached to surfaces (surface NBs) with diameters of <1\u00a0\u03bcm. Compared to macro and microbubbles, NBs have demonstrated unique characteristics such as long residence times in water, higher gas mass transfer efficiency, and hydroxyl radical production. This paper focuses on reviewing NB technology in aquaculture systems by summarizing and discussing uses and implications. Three focus areas were targeted to review the applicability and effects of NBs in aquaculture: (i) NBs aeration to improve the aquaculture harvest yield and subsequent wastewater treatment; (ii) NB application for inactivation of harmful microorganisms; and (iii) NBs for reducing oxidative stress and improving animal health. Thus, this study reviews the research studies published in the last 10\u00a0years in which air, oxygen, ozone, and hydrogen NBs were tested to improve gas mass transfer, wastewater treatment, and control of pathogenic microorganisms. The experimental results indicated that air and oxygen NBs yield significantly higher productivity, growth rate, total harvest, survival rate, and less oxygen consumption in fish and shrimp farming. Secondly, the application of air and ozone NBs demonstrated the ability of efficient pollutant degradation. Third, NB application demonstrated effective control of infectious bacteria and viruses, and thus increased fish survival, as well as different gene expression patterns that induce immune responses to infections. Reviewed studies lack robust comparative analyses of the efficacy of macro- and microbubble treatments. Also, potential health and safety implications, as well as economic feasibility through factors such as changes in capital infrastructure, routine maintenance and energy consumption need to be considered and evaluated in parallel to applicability. Therefore, even with a promising future, further studies are needed to confirm the benefits of NB treatment versus conventional aquaculture practices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
