Recently, some novel sludge reduction techniques have been developed based on chemical oxidation and metabolic uncoupling. This paper attempts to review those chemical-assisted sludge reduction processes, including sludge alkaline-thermal treatment, activated sludge-ozonation process, chlorination-combined activated sludge process, sludge reduction by metabolic uncouplers and high dissolved oxygen activated sludge process. In these combined activated sludge processes, excess sludge production can be reduced up to 100% without significant effect on process efficiency and stability. This paper would be useful when one is looking for appropriate environmentally and economically acceptable solutions for reducing or minimizing excess sludge production from wastewater biological treatment process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore. cyliu@ntu.edu.sg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkalies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkalies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Aerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}], "NumberOfReferences": "49"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12656222", "10.1016/s0045-6535(02)00551-9", "S0045-6535(02)00551-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
