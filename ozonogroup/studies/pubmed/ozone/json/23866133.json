Furthermore, the intracellular metabolites could be released into surrounding waters when the cyanobacterial membranes are destroyed. Although a variety of techniques have been developed to control cyanobacterial blooms and remove cyanobacterial cells or metabolites in water treatment processes, the effect of these treatments on the membrane integrity of cyanobacterial cells have not been systematically studied and compared. This study evaluated the effectiveness of copper sulphate (CuSO4), chlorine, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone on the cell integrity and densities of Microcystis aeruginosa. All of these technologies can compromise the cell membrane of cyanobacteria to varying degrees. Chlorine showed the strongest ability to impair the cell integrity with a majority (\u2265 88%) of the cells compromised within the first minute and with the cell lysis rates ranging of 0.640-3.82 h(-1) during 1-60 min. Ozone dose of 6 mg L(-1) also could induce 90% lysis of the cyanobacterial cells in 5 min and the cell lysis rate of KMnO4 (10 mg L(-1)) was 0.829 h(-1). CuSO4 and H2O2 could not only destroy the viability of cyanobacterial cells but also showed algistatic potential over the 7 day treatment. The potential of all the oxidants (chlorine, KMnO4, H2O2 and ozone) considered as algicides were discussed in this study. The benefits and drawbacks of these control and water treatment options were assessed as well."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2013. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
