Consequently, the rate of oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) to sulfate and nitric acid, respectively, can be very different in plumes and in the background air (i.e., air outside the plume). In addition, the formation of sulfate and nitric acid in a power plant plume is a strong function of the chemical composition of the background air and the prevailing meteorological conditions. We describe the use of a reactive plume model, the Reactive and Optics Model of Emissions, to simulate sulfate and nitrate formation in a power plant plume for a variety of background conditions. We show that SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> oxidation rates are maximum in the background air for volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited airsheds but are maximum at some downwind distance in the plume when the background air is nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>)-limited. Our analysis also shows that it is essential to obtain measurements of background concentrations of ozone, aldehydes, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and other VOCs to properly describe plume chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. , San Ramon , California , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karamchandani", "ForeName": "Prakash", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. , San Ramon , California , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seigneur", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29073857", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463885"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
