The common pollutants known to be disease-causing are particulate matter, ground-level ozone, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Although the association between increasing concentrations of these pollutants and cardiovascular disease is now accepted, the association of air pollution and arrhythmias is less well established. In this review we provide an in-depth discussion of the association of acute and chronic air pollution exposure and arrhythmia incidence, morbidity, and mortality, and the purported pathophysiological mechanisms. Increases in concentrations of air pollutants have multiple proarrhythmic mechanisms including systemic inflammation (via increases in reactive oxygen species, tumour necrosis factor, and direct effects from translocated particulate matter), structural remodelling (via an increased risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction or by affecting the cell-to-cell coupling and gap junction function), and mitochondrial and autonomic dysfunction. Furthermore, we describe the associations of air pollution and arrhythmias. There is a strong correlation of acute and chronic air pollutant exposure and the incidence of atrial fibrillation. Acute increases in air pollution increase the risk of emergency room visits and hospital admissions for atrial fibrillation and the risk of stroke and mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation. Similarly, there is a strong correlation of increases of air pollutants and the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
