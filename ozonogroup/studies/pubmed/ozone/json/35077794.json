Furthermore, the online monitoring of MPs is challenging but desirable for efficient treatment operation. This study investigates how preceding ozonation impacts the adsorption of bulk organics (expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD)) and ozone-recalcitrant MPs, i.e., primidone, atrazine and alachlor, in leachate using batch and column adsorption tests. Additionally, a new surrogate-based model was evaluated for predicting MPs breakthrough. Batch tests revealed that ozonation results in a decreasing apparent affinity of COD towards AC, but the non-adsorbable part did not obviously change. The adsorption of MPs in ozonated leachate was (1-41%) higher than that in non-ozonated leachate, especially for the more hydrophobic alachlor and atrazine, due to a reduced sites competition from bulk organics. Column adsorption showed that ozonation delayed COD and MPs breakthrough due to the reduced COD loading and sites competition, respectively. An increased empty bed contact time (EBCT, 10-40 min) led to an increased COD uptake by a factor of 3.0-3.2 for ozonated and non-ozonated leachates, while MPs adsorption also increased, suggesting that pore blockage rather than site competition could be the dominant inhibitory effect. The data from column adsorption demonstrate the applicability of developed surrogate-based model for predicting MPs breakthrough. Particularly, the fitting parameters were not affected by change of leachate characteristics, while they were impacted by change of EBCT."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
