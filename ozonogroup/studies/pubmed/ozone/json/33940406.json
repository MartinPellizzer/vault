However, the results were controversial. To provide researchers reliable evidence, this meta-analysis was performed.", "We searched all published studies in four databases examining the effects of particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub>), nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) on hypertension and blood pressure in children and adolescents. Overall risk estimates associated with per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of air pollution were analyzed by a random-effect model for articles with significant heterogeneity, otherwise, a fixed-effect model was applied. Subgroup analysis was conducted for studies with significant heterogeneity.", "Of 3918 identified literatures, 154 were evaluated in-depth with 15 satisfying inclusion criteria. Increased risk of hypertension was associated with long-term PM<sub>10</sub> exposure (OR = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.13, 1.21). For systolic blood pressure (SBP), significant results were found for short-term PM<sub>10</sub> (\u03b2 = 0.26, 95% CI: -0.00, 0.53) exposure, long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> (\u03b2 = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.94, 2.65) and PM<sub>10</sub> (\u03b2 = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.81) exposure. The corresponding estimates of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 0.32 mmHg (95% CI: 0.19, 0.45) for short-term PM<sub>10</sub> exposure, 1.06 mmHg (95% CI: 0.32, 1.80), 0.34 mmHg (95% CI: 0.11, 0.57) and 0.44 mmHg (95% CI: 0.25, 0.63) for long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure, respectively. Stratified analyses showed stronger effects of PM<sub>10</sub> on blood pressure among studies with \u226550% boys' percentage (0.57 mmHg [95% CI: 0.44, 0.70] for SBP, 0.44 mmHg, [95% CI: 0.34, 0.54] for DBP, respectively) and articles using models to estimate exposure (0.90 mmHg [95% CI: 0.20 1.59] for SBP).", "Ambient air pollution was associated with higher hypertension prevalence and elevated blood pressure in children and adolescents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
