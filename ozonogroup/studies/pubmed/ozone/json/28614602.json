The NO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of these TFTs with the dielectric surface UVO treatment is \u2248400\u00d7 greater for [NO<sub>2</sub> ] = 30 ppm than for those without UVO treatment. Importantly, the sensitivity is \u224850\u00d7 greater for [NO<sub>2</sub> ] = 1 ppm with the UVO-treated TFTs, and a limit of detection of \u2248400 ppb is achieved with this sensing platform. The morphology, microstructure, and chemical composition of the gate dielectric and CuPc films are analyzed by atomic force microscopy, grazing incident X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, revealing that the enhanced sensing performance originates from UVO-derived hydroxylated species on the dielectric surface and not from chemical reactions between NO<sub>2</sub> and the dielectric/semiconductor components. This work demonstrates that dielectric/semiconductor interface engineering is essential for readily manufacturable high-performance TFT-based gas sensors."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
