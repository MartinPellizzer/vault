The ionization energies of the first ionized states were determined and an interpretation of the O3 spectrum with respect to its first three ionic states, 1 2A1, 1 2B2, and 1 2A2, is presented. Above 16 eV the enhancement of the intensities of the 2 2B1, 3 2A1, and 4 2B2 band systems due to the contribution of indirect processes was observed, not accessible by conventional photoelectron spectroscopy. It was also resolved and assigned the extensive vibrational structures of ozone. Between 15.5 and 18.5 eV the main band contours are similar to those found in conventional photoelectron spectroscopy, except that our threshold photoelectron spectrum reveals extensive additional vibrational structures. The band 2 2B1 was found to present an irregular vibrational spacing DeltaE, with a minimum value of 80 meV at approximately 16.47 eV."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, Campus Universit\u00e1rio, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais 36036-330, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Couto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mocellin", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomes", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naves de Brito", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lopes", "ForeName": "M C A", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16774336", "10.1063/1.2200702"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
