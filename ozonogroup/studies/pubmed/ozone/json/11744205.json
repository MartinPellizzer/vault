Given its physicochemical properties, it requires new treatment approaches. Both aqueous O(3) and a combination of O(3)/H(2)O(2), which gives *OH, can remove MTBE from water, making use of O(3) a viable technology for remediation of groundwater from fuel contaminated sites. Rate constants and temperature dependencies for reactions of MTBE with O(3) or with *OH at pH 7.2, in a range of 21-45 degrees C (294-318K) were measured. The second-order rate constant for reaction of MTBE with O(3) is 1.4 x 10(18)exp(-95.4/RT) (M(-1)s(-1)), and for reaction of MTBE with *OH produced by the combination of O(3)/H(2)O(2) is 8.0 x 10(9)exp(-4.6/RT) (M(-1)s(-1)), with the activation energy (kJ mol(-1)) in both cases. At 25 degrees C, this corresponds to a rate constant of 27 M(-1)s(-1) for ozone alone, and 1.2 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1) for O(3)/H(2)O(2). The concentration of *OH was determined using benzene trapping. Products of reactions of O(3) and O(3)/H(2)O(2) with MTBE, including t-butyl-formate (TBF), t-butyl alcohol (TBA), methyl acetate, and acetone, were determined after oxidant depletion. A reaction pathway for mineralization of MTBE was also explored. Under continuously stirred flow reactor (CSTR) conditions, addition of H(2)O(2) markedly increases the rate and degree of degradation of MTBE by O(3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, University of California, 4666 Physical Sciences North, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-5131, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitani", "ForeName": "Marie M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "Arturo A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bunton", "ForeName": "Clifford A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rinker", "ForeName": "Robert G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandall", "ForeName": "Orville C", "Initials": "OC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29I4YB3S89", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl tert-butyl ether"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11744205", "10.1016/s0304-3894(01)00309-0", "S0304389401003090"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
