The initial effluent was found to be highly enriched in heavy metals and to possess the elevated levels of organic contaminants. The values of Cr(VI), Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, TOC, and COD exceeded the upper permissible limits of 63, 220.2, 1.1, 7, 131.3, 1.7, 12.3, and 11.4\u00a0times, respectively. The heavy metal removal was forced either by the coagulation/flocculation using Fe(II), Fe(III), and Al(III) ions released into the treated solution by the electrochemical corrosion of the sacrificial iron and aluminum electrodes, or the precipitation of the metal hydroxides as well as co-precipitation with iron and aluminum hydroxides. The principle organic matter destruction mechanisms were ozone oxidation and the indirect oxidation with chlorine/hypochlorite formed by the anodic oxidation of chloride already present in the wastewater. Following the combined treatment, the removal efficiencies of Cr(VI), Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, TOC, and COD were 99.94%, 100.00%, 95.86%, 98.66%, 99.97%, 96.81%, 93.24%, and 93.43%, respectively, thus complying with the regulated values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Energy Ltd., Zagreb, Croatia. vorescan@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orescanin", "ForeName": "Visnja", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kollar", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mikelic", "ForeName": "Ivanka Lovrencic", "Initials": "IL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nad", "ForeName": "Karlo", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electroplating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23705621", "10.1080/10934529.2013.781904"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
