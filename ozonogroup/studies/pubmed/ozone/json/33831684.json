However, how the residual ozone affects the biological process is not well studied. In this work, a pilot scale integrated O<sub>3</sub>-BAF, ordinary BAF and separated O<sub>3</sub>-BAF were compared in advanced treatment of real bio-treated petrochemical wastewater. Results showed that residual ozone with 0.05-0.10\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in the BAF demonstrated relatively high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 48.4%, which was 1.5-fold higher than that obtained by separated O<sub>3</sub>-BAF and 3-fold higher than that obtained by ordinary BAF. The stimulative effect of low dosage of O<sub>3</sub> on biological treatment additionally donated 33.9% of the COD removal in the BAF. The COD removal amount per dosage of ozone reached 5.30\u00a0mg-COD/mg-O<sub>3</sub>. The biofilm thickness in the integrated O<sub>3</sub>-BAF was reduced by 30-50% while the dehydrogenase activity (DHA) was improved by 500%, indicating the stimulate effect on the bioactivity. Additionally, Illumina HiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons demonstrated significant microbial diversity decreasing. Specially, Gemmatimonadetes and Bacteroidetes are the dominate microorganism in the integrated O<sub>3</sub>-BAF, having a positive correlation with the proper residual ozone, and increased by 5.4% and 4.2% in comparison with the separated O<sub>3</sub>-BAF, respectively. The residual ozone higher than 0.22\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> showed inhibition effect on the bioactivity. In summary, the control of residual ozone introduced to BAF was crucial for stimulative effects and manager the microbial community in the integrated O<sub>3</sub>-BAF, which still need further detail research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
