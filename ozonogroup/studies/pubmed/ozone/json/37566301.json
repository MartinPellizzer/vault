Here, we use ground-level observations and model simulations to examine the nationwide spatial-temporal variations of six air pollutants before and after the initiation of First-Level Public Health Emergency Response. The level of ambient NO<sub>2</sub> declined significantly, and in most cities, the decline was dominated by reduced emissions. Meanwhile, the level of O<sub>3</sub> increased significantly during this period, and the nonmeteorological factors explained the increase. For the other air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO), the observed declines on the national scale were obviously affected by the meteorological conditions. In Wuhan, significant declines were found for air pollutants except O<sub>3</sub> and emissions dominated the changes, while in Beijing during the same period, only the level of NO<sub>2</sub> significantly declined. This study clearly shows that the meteorological changes contributed substantially to the observed changes in most air pollutants, and this must be considered in evaluating the impacts of pollutant source changes on air quality during the specific event and in assessing source-oriented risks."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Chemical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5632-5371"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200240, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yanbin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0673-3243"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200240, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmosphere, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiaotian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30318, United States."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Huizhong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmosphere, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yanxu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30318, United States."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yongtao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7731-5399"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Guofeng", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101628367"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no competing financial interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37566301", "10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00304"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
