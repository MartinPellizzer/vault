The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare two chemical oxidation processes under different operational conditions, i.e. Fenton process and ozonation, for alleviation of UV<sub>254</sub> absorbance of a biologically pre-treated landfill leachate. Results showed that leachate UV<sub>254</sub> absorbance was reduced due to the UVQS decomposition by hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) during Fenton treatment, or by ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and \u00b7OH during ozonation. Fenton process exhibited a better treatment performance than ozonation under their respective optimal conditions, because \u00b7OH could effectively decompose both hydrophobic and hydrophilic dissolved organic matter (DOM), but O<sub>3</sub> tended to selectively oxidize hydrophobic compounds alone. Different analytical techniques, including molecular weight (MW) fractionation, hydrophobic/hydrophilic isolation, UV spectra scanning, parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectrophotometry, were used to characterize UVQS. After either oxidation treatment, residual UVQS was more hydrophilic with a higher fraction of low MW molecules. It should be noted that the removed UV<sub>254</sub> absorbance (\u0394UV<sub>254</sub>) was directly proportional to the removed COD (\u0394COD) for the both treatments (Fenton process: \u0394UV<sub>254</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.011\u0394COD; ozonation: \u0394UV<sub>254</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.016\u0394COD). A greater \u0394UV<sub>254</sub>/\u0394COD was observed for ozonation, suggesting that oxidant was more efficiently utilized during ozonation than in Fenton treatment for mitigation of the UV absorbance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
