Fifteen indicator compounds were identified to represent the large number of PPCPs reported worldwide. Criteria applied to determine the indicator compounds included PPCPs widely used, observed at great frequency in aqueous systems, resistant to treatment, persistent in the environment, and representative of classes of organics. Through a pilot plant investigation to understand the optimal combination of unit process for treating PPCPs, 12 treatment trains with their additive and synergistic contributions were investigated; processes included dissolved air flotation (DAF), pre- and intermediate-ozonation with and without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, intermediate chlorination, dual media filtration, granular activated carbon (GAC), and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Treatment trains that achieved the greatest removals involved 1. DAF followed by intermediate ozonation, dual media filtration, and virgin GAC; 2. pre-ozonation followed by DAF, dual media filtration, and virgin GAC; and, 3. DAF (with either pre- or intermediate oxidation) followed by dual media filtration and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Results revealed significant removal efficiencies for virgin GAC (preceded by DAF and intermediate ozonation) and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with an intensity of 700\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, where more than 12 of the compounds were removed by greater than 90%. Reduced PPCP removals were observed with virgin GAC preceded by pre-ozonation and DAF. Intermediate ozonation was more effective than using pre-ozonation, demonstrating the importance of this process targeting PPCPs after treatment of natural organic matter. Removal efficiencies of indicator compounds through ozonation were found to be a function of the O<sub>3</sub> rate constants (k<sub>O3</sub>). For compounds with low O<sub>3</sub> rate constants (k<sub>O3</sub>\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition in the O<sub>3</sub> reactor was required. Of the 15 indicator compounds, tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and cotinine were observed to be the most recalcitrant. Although UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with elevated intensity (700\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) was effective for PPCP removals, energy requirements far exceed intensities applied for disinfection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
