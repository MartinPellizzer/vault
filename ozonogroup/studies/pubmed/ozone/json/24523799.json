Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of ozone, fine particles, and other airborne toxicants. Air pollution factors are considered as one of the underlying causes of respiratory diseases. This study aimed to determine the association of respiratory diseases documented in medical records and air pollution (Map distribution) of accumulation in Isfahan province, Iran. By plotting the prevalence and spatial distribution maps, important differences from different points can be observed.", "The geographic information system (GIS), pollutant standards index (PSI) measurements, and remote Sensing (RS) technology were used after entering data in the mapping information table; spatial distribution was mapped and distribution of Geographical Epidemiology of Respiratory Diseases in Isfahan province (Iran) was determined in this case study from 2005 to 2009.", "Space with tracing the distribution of respiratory diseases was scattered based on the distribution of air pollution in the points is an important part of this type of diseases in Isfahan province where air pollution was more abundant.", "The findings of this study emphasis on the importance of preventing the exposure to air pollution, and to control air pollution product industries, to improve work environmental health, and to increase the health professionals and public knowledge in this regard."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PhD Student, Department of Geography, University of Isfahan and Remote Sensing Researcher, Iranian Space Research Center, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashidi", "ForeName": "Maasoumeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, University of Isfahan, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramesht", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Remote Sensing Researcher, University of Tehran and Iranian Space Research Center, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zohary", "ForeName": "Moein", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering, Environment Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Poursafa", "ForeName": "Parinaz", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Pediatric Cardiology, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kelishadi", "ForeName": "Roya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sport Psychology, School of Physical Education, Islamic Azad University, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashidi", "ForeName": "Zeinab", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Specialist in Community Medicine, Researcher, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rouzbahani", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Res Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101235599", "ISSNLinking": "1735-1995"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Azizi F.
