We explored the spatiotemporal variations in O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the THB with ozone suppression (OS) under high air temperature over metropolitan, small urban, and mountainous areas. The bipolarized interannual trends in interannual O<sub>3</sub> variations in urban and mountainous areas over central China were characterized with the increasing and decreasing 90th percentiles of the daily maximum 8-h (MDA8-90) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations respectively in polluted urban areas and clean mountainous areas over recent eight years. The changes of the near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations with air temperature exhibited the inflection points of OS from increasing to decreasing O<sub>3</sub> at air temperature of 30.5\u00a0\u00b0C in mountainous areas, 32.5\u00a0\u00b0C in small urban areas, and 34.5\u00a0\u00b0C in metropolitan areas, and the intensity of OS was estimated in the ranking with mountainous areas (-2.30\u00a0\u03bcg\u2e31m<sup>-3</sup>\u2e31\u00b0C<sup>-1</sup>)\u00a0>\u00a0small urban areas (-1.96\u00a0\u03bcg\u2e31m<sup>-3</sup>\u2e31\u00b0C<sup>-1</sup>)\u00a0>\u00a0metropolitan areas (-1.54\u00a0\u03bcg\u2e31m<sup>-3</sup>\u2e31\u00b0C<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the OS was more significant over the lower-O<sub>3</sub> mountainous areas.
