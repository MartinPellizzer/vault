We identified 293,888 participants who were free of PD at baseline in the UK Biobank (2006-2010). Time-varying air pollution [fine particulate (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)] exposures were estimated using spatio-temporal models. Incident cases of PD were identified using validated algorithms. Four methods were used to investigate the associations between air pollution and PD, including (1) standard time-varying Cox proportional-hazard model; (2) Cox models weighted by generalized propensity score (GPS) and inverse-probability weights (IPW); (3) instrumental variable (IV) analysis; and (4) negative control outcome analysis. During a median of 11.6\u00a0years of follow-up, 1822 incident PD cases were identified. Based on standard Cox regression, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for a 1\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> or ppb increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were 1.23 (1.17, 1.30) and 1.02 (0.98, 1.05), respectively. Consistent results were found in models weighted by GPS and IPW, and in IV analysis. There were no significant associations between air pollution and negative control outcomes. This study provides evidence to support a causal association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and PD. Mitigation of air pollution could be a protective measure against PD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
