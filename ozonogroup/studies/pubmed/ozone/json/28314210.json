Ozonation of wastewater is a powerful option to abate micropollutants, but may result in the formation of the potentially toxic oxidation by-product bromate in bromide-containing wastewaters. This study investigates options to reduce bromate formation during wastewater ozonation by (i) reducing the bromide concentration of the wastewater, (ii) lowering the ozone dose during wastewater treatment and (iii) adding hydrogen peroxide to limit the lifetime of ozone and quench the intermediates of the bromate formation pathway. Two examples demonstrate that a high share of bromide in wastewater can originate from single point sources (e.g., municipal waste incinerators or landfills). The identification of major point sources requires laborious sampling campaigns, but may facilitate the reduction of the bromide load significantly. To reduce the bromate formation by lowering the ozone dose interferes with the aim to abate micropollutants. Therefore, an additional treatment is necessary to ensure the elimination of micropollutants. Experiments at a pilot-plant illustrate that a combined treatment (ozone/powdered activated carbon) allows to eliminate micropollutants with low bromate yields. Furthermore, the addition of hydrogen peroxide was investigated at bench-scale. The bromate yields could be reduced by \u223c50% and 65% for a hydrogen peroxide dose of 5 and 10\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In conclusion, there are options to reduce the bromate formation during wastewater ozonation, however, they are not simple with sometimes limited efficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
