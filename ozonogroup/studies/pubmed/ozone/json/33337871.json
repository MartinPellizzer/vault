Yields (ppb product emitted/ppb ozone consumed) for 40 products were quantified. Major products of the primary reaction of ozone-squalene included 6-methyl 5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) and geranyl acetone (GA) with average yields of 0.22 and 0.16, respectively. Other major products included decanal, methacrolein (or methyl vinyl ketone), nonanal, and butanal. Yields varied widely among participants; summed yields ranged from 0.33 to 0.93. The dynamic increase in emission rates during ozone exposure also varied among participants, possibly indicative of differences in the thickness of the skin lipid layer. Factor analysis indicates that much of the variability among participants is due to factors associated with the relative abundance of (1) \"fresh\" skin lipid constituents (such as squalene and fatty acids), (2) oxidized skin lipids, and (3) exogenous compounds. This last factor appears to be associated with the presence of oleic and linoleic acids and could be accounted for by uptake of cooking oils or personal care products to skin lipids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6876-7185"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, United States."}], "LastName": "Morrison", "ForeName": "Glenn C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0878-9969"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, United States."}], "LastName": "Eftekhari", "ForeName": "Azin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7688-1452"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aerodyne Research Inc., Billerica, Massachusetts 01821, United States."}], "LastName": "Majluf", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3642-0659"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aerodyne Research Inc., Billerica, Massachusetts 01821, United States."}], "LastName": "Krechmer", "ForeName": "Jordan E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7QWM220FJH", "NameOfSubstance": "Squalene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Squalene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33337871", "10.1021/acs.est.0c05262"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
