The Antarctic endemic Schistidium antarctici possessed half the combined pool of UV screens of the other species but, as in C. purpureus, these were predominantly cell wall bound. Confocal microscopy confirmed the localization of UV screens in each species. * Greater investment in cell wall-bound UV screens offers C. purpureus a more spatially uniform, and potentially more effective, UV screen. Schistidium antarctici has the lowest UV-screening potential, indicating that this species may be disadvantaged under continuing springtime ozone depletion. Cell wall compounds have not previously been quantified in bryophytes but may be an important component of the UV defences of lower plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Conservation Biology, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clarke", "ForeName": "Laurence J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Conservation Biology, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "Sharon A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bryopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Allen DR, Bevilacqua RM, Nedoluha GE, Randall CE, Manney GL. 2003.
