The effects of the inoculum, sludge growth mode, and temperature were investigated. These factors played roles in the organics removal performance and microbial communities of pulping wastewater treatment systems. At 50\u00a0\u00b0C, the TBS inoculated with optimal inoculum achieved 59.12% and 37.96% reductions in COD and chromaticity, which were superior to the reductions achieved by other systems. In this TBS, thermophilic lignocellulolytic microorganisms (Chloroflexus, Meiothermus, norank_f_Caldilineaceae, and Roseiflexus) and carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria (norank_f_Anaerolineaceae) were predominant. Their relative abundances were 25.55% and 10.42%, respectively. For enhanced removal of COD and chromaticity, an integrated system consisting of a primary TBS, ozonation, and a secondary TBS was proposed. The total COD and chromaticity removal efficiencies increased to 90.48% and 87.89%, respectively. BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD increased from 0.20 to 0.40, and shifts of lignin-like and humic acid-like substances were observed during ozonation with the primary TBS effluent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
