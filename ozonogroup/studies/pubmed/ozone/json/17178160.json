Under these circumstances, it most often becomes inevitable to apply energy-intense and hence \"imperative\" treatment technologies (so-called advanced oxidation processes, AOPs) to achieve an acceptable reduction in the organic content of the effluent, thereby improving the biocompatibility of the originally refractory wastewater. The present experimental study focused on three problematic dyehouse effluent streams in order to alleviate the problem of toxicity and recalcitrance arising from the use of certain textile chemicals at source. For that purpose, the textile preparation stage was simulated by a nonionic surfactant (NS), the polyamide dyeing stage by a synthetic tannin (syntan; ST), and an aqueous biocidal finishing (BF) solution was employed to mimic typical textile finishing effluent. Synthetic effluent streams bearing NS, ST, or BF were subjected to treatment with different, well-established AOPs (ozonation at varying pH; advanced oxidation with H(2)O(2)/UV-C at varying H(2)O(2) concentrations) in order to degrade the active ingredients of the auxiliary formulations, thereby eliminating their toxicity and recalcitrance. Baseline experiments were conducted in order to optimize AOP conditions that were consecutively applied to observe changes in the originally poor effluent biodegradability and high toxicity. Obtained experimental findings revealed that (i) the COD content of NS could be reduced by at least 50% after H(2)O(2)/UV-C treatment at pH 9.0 accompanied by a nearly twofold improvement in its already fair biodegradability; (ii) the inhibitory effect of the biochemically reluctant ST on heterotrophic biomass was completely eliminated upon ozonation (dose=900 mg h(-1)) at pH 3.5; and (iii) the microbial toxicity exerted by BF totally disappeared after ozonation (dose=600 mg h(-1)) at pH 7.2. However, the achievement of detoxification and/or biodegradability improvement was accompanied with high electrical energy requirements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istanbul Technical University, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Department of Environmental Engineering, 34469 Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey. arslanid@itu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arslan-Alaton", "ForeName": "Idil", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alaton", "ForeName": "Izzet", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17178160", "10.1016/j.ecoenv.2006.03.009", "S0147-6513(06)00067-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
