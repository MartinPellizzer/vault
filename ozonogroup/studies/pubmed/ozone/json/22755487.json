A new headspace solid-phase microextraction method was used, which included gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and provided method detection limits of less than 0.1 microg/L, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 to 5. The results showed that disinfection by using either chlorine or ozone caused a significant formation of THMs in situ. Speciation of the THMs was a strong function of the water matrix, with initial bromide concentrations playing a pivotal role. These results provide a tool for understanding and monitoring the formation of key disinfection byproducts in marine aquaria that may cause respiratory, eye irritation, or other health concerns."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Honglan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "Craig", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Microextraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22755487", "10.2175/106143012x13280358613381"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
