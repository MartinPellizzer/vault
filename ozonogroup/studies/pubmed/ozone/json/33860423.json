This study aimed to investigate the efficiency of ozone-assisted electrocoagulation process (EC/O<sub>3</sub>) for the treatment of real cardboard wastewater. The parameters influencing COD removal in the EC/O<sub>3</sub> process were optimized using response surface methodology. Regard to the statistical model, the optimum conditions were obtained at current density 9.6\u00a0mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, time 20\u00a0min, and pH\u00a012. At optimal condition, EC/O<sub>3</sub> process removed 74.7% and 97.5% of COD and color, which was higher compared to ozonation and EC processes separately. The COD removal followed pseudo-first-order kinetic with the coefficient correlation of 0.97 and the reaction rate constant of 0.073 1/min. To sum up, the combined electrocoagulation process with ozonation could be used satisfactorily for removing pollutants from real cardboard wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
