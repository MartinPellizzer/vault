Atmospheric ozone may also be an indicator of earthquake generation. Ground-level observations of atmospheric ozone at multiple sites were conducted in this study at the time of multiple earthquake occurrences in Japan in 2022. As the result of this study, ozone peaks of unknown origin were detected during the occurrence of multiple earthquakes across Japan in 2022. The level of these ozone peaks began to increase from a few days to a few hours before each earthquake, reaching a maximum concentration coincident with the time of earthquake generation. 'Unknown ozone' were detected at near earthquake epicentres, except in the case of deep earthquakes. The 'unknown ozone' were also associated with earthquake seismic intensities, which were monitored at seismograph stations in various Japanese cities, towns, and villages. A laboratory experiment by Baragiola et al. (2011) indicated that ppm levels of ozone can be generated in air by the crushing and grinding of terrestrial crustal rocks, generated by exo-electrons emitted by high electric fields, resulting from charge separation during rock fracture. Baragiola et al. (2011) proposed a hypothesis whereby atmospheric ozone could be generated via rock fracturing during the occurrence of earthquakes. This hypothesis could explain the ozone peaks correlating with multiple Japanese earthquakes observed in this study. The significance of atmospheric ozone generated by seismic activity is discussed in terms of it being a possible indicator of earthquake generation and prediction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
