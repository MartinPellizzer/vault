Food quality and safety management are still major issues for the supply chain. The use of ozone has been identified as a feasible solution to reduce microorganisms present in food, in this way extending the shelf-life of fresh produce. A number of factors that may affect the efficiency of ozone treatment have been identified, e.g. microbial populations, ozone concentration and time of exposure, type of produce, temperature, relative humidity and packaging material, and they are briefly discussed. Furthermore, practical information derived from studies with ozone conducted by the authors and from their knowledge of the subject directs the reader's attention to the key aspects of ozone use under commercial conditions, i.e. from the practical point of view. Finally, one possible direction for future research with the postharvest use of ozone, i.e. the important role of fruit cuticle in response to this postharvest treatment, is indicated. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, Chatham, ME4 4TB, UK.
