Wheezing is one of the most common symptoms when diagnosing of asthma; thus, we investigated the associations of O<sub>3</sub> exposure before and during pregnancy with wheezing in preschool children and the potential susceptible exposure windows from a heavily polluted city in China. This population-based birth cohort study, which included 3725 mother-child pairs from Guangzhou, began in 2016, and the follow-up period ended on July 31, 2020. We used a spatiotemporal land-use-regression model combined with activity patterns to estimate the daily O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels during the pre-pregnancy period and each trimester, and wheezing was recorded by reviewing medical records. We used the Cox proportional hazard model to quantify the effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on childhood wheezing adjusted for potential confounders. No significant association was detected between pre-pregnancy exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and childhood wheezing. However, increased ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposures throughout pregnancy and in the second trimester were positively associated with the risk of childhood wheezing, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) per interquartile range (IQR) increment of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04-1.44) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09-1.58), respectively. The effects of maternal O<sub>3</sub> exposure on childhood wheezing risk was stronger when the exposure occurred in the warm conception season (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Significant childhood wheezing risk could be attributable to maternal O<sub>3</sub> exposure, especially during the second trimester and with warm-season conception in Guangzhou. Further cohorts of children, particularly school age children who have more robust asthma diagnoses, should be investigated in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
