This study reports, for the first time, NCA formation when gas-phase ozone reacts with human surfaces. In an occupied climate-controlled chamber, we detected NCA only when ozone was present. NCA emissions were dependent on clothing coverage, occupant age, air temperature, and humidity. Ozone-initiated chemistry with human skin lipids (particularly their primary surface reaction products) is the key mechanism driving NCA emissions, as evidenced by positive correlations with squalene in human skin wipe samples and known gaseous products from ozonolysis of skin lipids. Oxidation by OH radicals, autoxidation reactions, and human-emitted NH<sub>3</sub> may also play a role in NCA formation. Such chemical processes are anticipated to generate aerosols of the smallest size (1.18-1.55 nm), whereas larger clusters result from subsequent growth of the smaller aerosols. This study shows that whenever we encounter ozone indoors, where we spend most of our lives, NCAs will be produced in the air around us."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human-Oriented Built Environment Lab, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne 1015, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5945-0872"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human-Oriented Built Environment Lab, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne 1015, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Licina", "ForeName": "Dusan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9097-5850"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Department of Civil Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby 2800, Denmark."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, United States."}], "LastName": "Weschler", "ForeName": "Charles J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3197-8151"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Hahn-Meitner Weg 1, Mainz 55128, Germany."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Nijing", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2721-5362"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Hahn-Meitner Weg 1, Mainz 55128, Germany."}], "LastName": "Zannoni", "ForeName": "Nora", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0620-6301"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Hahn-Meitner Weg 1, Mainz 55128, Germany."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mengze", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Airmodus Limited, Erik Palm\u00e9nin Aukio 1, Helsinki FI-00560, Finland."}], "LastName": "Vanhanen", "ForeName": "Joonas", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6580-8911"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, G\u00f6teborg SE-400 14, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Division of Building Services Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg SE-412 96, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Langer", "ForeName": "Sarka", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Department of Civil Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby 2800, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Wargocki", "ForeName": "Pawel", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9421-1703"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Hahn-Meitner Weg 1, Mainz 55128, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Energy, Environment and Water Research Center, The Cyprus Institute, Nicosia 2121, Cyprus."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Jonathan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6107-8336"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Department of Civil Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby 2800, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Bek\u00f6", "ForeName": "Gabriel", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34672572", "10.1021/acs.est.1c03379"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
