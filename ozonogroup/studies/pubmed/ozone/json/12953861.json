As one step in addressing this issue, we have studied the transformations of bulk (uncharacterized) organic nitrogen in fogwaters and aerosol aqueous extracts during exposure to simulated sunlight and O3. Our results show that over the course of several hours of exposure a significant portion of condensed-phase organic nitrogen is transformed into ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, and NOx. For nitrite, there was both photochemical formation and destruction, resulting in a slow net loss. Ammonium and nitrate were formed at initial rates on the order of a few micromolar per hour in the bulk fogwaters, corresponding to formation rates of approximately 10 and 40 ng m(-3) h(-1), respectively, in ambient fog. The average initial formation rate (expressed as ng (m of air)(-3) h(-1)) of NH4+ in the aqueous extracts of fine particles (PM2.5) was approximately one-half of the corresponding fogwater value. Initial formation rates of NOx (i.e., NO + NO2) were equivalent to approximately 2-11 pptv h(-1) in the three fogwaters tested. Although the formation rates of ammonium and nitrate were relatively small as compared to their initial concentrations in fogwaters (approximately 200-2000 microM) and aerosol particles (approximately 400-1500 ng m(-3)), this photochemical mineralization and \"renoxification\" from condensed-phase organic N is a previously uncharacterized source of inorganic N in the atmosphere. This conversion also represents a new component in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen that might have significant influences on atmospheric composition, condensed-phase properties, and the ecological impacts of N deposition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Science Program, Department of Land, Air, and Water Resources, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, California 95616-8627, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anastasio", "ForeName": "Cort", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12953861", "10.1021/es034114x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
