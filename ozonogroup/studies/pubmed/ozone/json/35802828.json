Daily fine particle mass concentrations and oxidant gases (nitrogen dioxide and ozone) were collected from ground monitors. Monthly estimates of fine particle constituents (metals and sulfur) and oxidative potential were also measured. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between air pollutants and respiratory hospitalizations, above and below median values for particle constituents and oxidative potential. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Lag-1 fine particulate matter mass concentrations were not associated with respiratory hospitalizations (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in fine particulate matter: 1.004 [0.955-1.056]) in analyses ignoring particle constituents and oxidative potential. However, when models were examined above or below median metals, sulfur, and oxidative potential, positive associations were observed above the median. For example, the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in fine particulate matter were 1.084 (1.007-1.167) when copper was above the median and 0.970 (0.929-1.014) when copper was below the median. Similar trends were observed for oxidant gases. <b>Conclusions:</b> Stronger associations were observed between outdoor fine particles, oxidant gases, and respiratory hospitalizations in children when metals, sulfur, and particle oxidative potential were elevated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Korsiak", "ForeName": "Jill", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Health Science Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Lavigne", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Health Science Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Hongyu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut; and."}], "LastName": "Pollitt", "ForeName": "Krystal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Health Science Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Kulka", "ForeName": "Ryan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering."}], "LastName": "Hatzopoulou", "ForeName": "Marianne", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, and."}], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Greg", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Population Studies Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Burnett", "ForeName": "Richard T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Health Science Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Weichenthal", "ForeName": "Scott", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2022 Dec 1;206(11):1310-1312. doi: 10.1164/rccm.202208-1513ED", "PMID": "35947726"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35802828", "10.1164/rccm.202205-0896OC"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
