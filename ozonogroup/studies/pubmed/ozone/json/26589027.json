In order to elucidate the question of the nature of the irradiation products, the structure, relative energies, and vibrational frequencies of various forms of On (n = 1-6) in the singlet, triplet, and, in some cases, quintet states were studied using the CCSD(T) method up to the CCSD(T,full)/cc-pCVTZ and CCSD(T,FC)/aug-cc-pVTZ levels. The results of calculations demonstrate the existence of stable highly symmetric structures O4 (D3h), O4 (D2d), and O6 (D3d) as well as the intermolecular complexes O2\u00b7O2, O2\u00b7O3, and O3\u00b7O3 in different conformations. The calculations show that the local minimum corresponding to the O3\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O complex is quite shallow and cannot explain the \u03bd3 band features close to 1040 cm(-1), as was proposed previously. For the ozone dimer, a new conformer was found which is more stable than the structure known to date. The effect of the ozone dimer on the registered IR spectra is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Nizhny Novgorod, 46 Ul'yanov Street, Nizhny Novgorod, 603950, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "G.G.
