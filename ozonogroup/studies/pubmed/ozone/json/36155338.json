The ageing process in the environment significantly alters the physicochemical characteristics of MPs and subsequently affects their toxicities. The health effects of aged MPs exposure and the mechanism underlying are worthy of exploration. Polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) (with size less than 50\u00a0\u00b5m) were obtained by grinding and screening polystyrene materials. PS-MPs continued to be aged by ozone treatment (0.4\u00a0mg/min, 9\u00a0h). Both male and female C57BL/6 mice were orally exposed to 0 or 2\u00a0mg/kg/d aged PS-MPs for 28 days. Results showed that PS-MPs were found in liver, ovary and spleen of females and liver, testis and spleen of males in the aged PS-MPs group. Exposure to aged PS-MPs significantly decreased abdominal fat/body coefficient, the adipocyte size and the serum LDL-C level in females. Compared to the control, serum estradiol (E2) level, the mRNA expression levels of genes regulating E2 production (17\u03b2-hsd, 3\u03b2-hsd and Star) in ovary and the protein expression levels of E2 receptors (ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2), AMPK\u03b1 and p-AMPK\u03b11 in liver increased significantly, and the mRNA expression levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) downstream genes (Srebp-1c, Fas and Scd1) in liver decreased significantly in the female aged PS-MPs group. Liver metabolomic profiling showed that differential metabolites between female aged PS-MPs group and female control group were enriched in biotin metabolism and the level of biotin increased significantly in the female aged PS-MPs group. However, no significant changes were detected in males. These results indicated that aged PS-MPs exposure increased ovarian E2 production and activated the AMPK pathway in the liver which might inhibit liver lipid synthesis only in females. Our findings provide new insights into the potential sex-specific health effects of environmental MPs pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
