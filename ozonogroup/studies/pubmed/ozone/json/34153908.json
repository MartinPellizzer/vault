Herein, evaluation of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) coupled with calcium peroxide (CaO<sub>2</sub>) for SMX elimination was carried out. The results showed that CaO<sub>2</sub> could promote SMX elimination in O<sub>3</sub> system. The removal efficiency was improved from 65.6% to 73.9% when the CaO<sub>2</sub> dosage was 0.06\u00a0g\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 0.55\u00a0g\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> was beneficial to SMX degradation. With decrease of initial SMX concentration, the removal of SMX firstly enhanced and then declined. Compared with alkaline, acidic and neutral conditions were favorable for SMX degradation. ROS including \u00b7OH, \u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> play critical role for SMX degradation. Synergetic effect could be established between O<sub>3</sub> and CaO<sub>2</sub>, which encouraged formation of \u00b7OH and accelerated SXM decomposition. The total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were all declined after O<sub>3</sub>/CaO<sub>2</sub> treatment. According to results of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and references, four major pathways were proposed. The O<sub>3</sub>/CaO<sub>2</sub> technology was also suitable for practical wastewater treatment. QSAR calculation and seed germination experiment showed that toxicity of the treatment solution was alleviated after O<sub>3</sub>/CaO<sub>2</sub> treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
