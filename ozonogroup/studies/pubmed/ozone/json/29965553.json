The results showed that the total anthropogenic OFP was 84187.61 kt in China in 2010, of which 6882.53 kt was from alkanes, 41496.92 kt from alkenes/alkynes, 32945.32 kt from aromatic hydrocarbons, 161.45 kt from halocarbons, and 2701.40 kt from oxygenated organics. The top 10 species in terms of OFP consisted of propene, ethene, <i>m/p</i>-xylene, toluene, 1-butene, <i>o</i>-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene, 1,3-butadiene, <i>m</i>-ethyl toluene and ethyl benzene, contributing 63.95% to the total OFP but only 31.84% to the mass-based emission. Industrial sources accounted for the largest (49.29%) of the total OFP, followed by transportation sources (28.31%) and agricultural sources (22.40%). The key industrial sources with high reactivity were architectural decoration industry, oil refinery industry, storage and transport, machinery equipment industry, transport equipment industry and printing. Passenger cars, motorcycles and heavy duty vehicles were the major OFP sources of transportation. The two biomass burning sources were both the key OFP sources of agriculture. Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Henan were the top five provinces with contributions of 39.65% of the total OFP in China. The reactivity-based emission inventory in this study would be of great significance for the formulation of reactivity-based ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) control strategies in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jia-Ni", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiao-Fang", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Tian-Li", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xi-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Control of Guangdong University Engineering Technology Research Center(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Li-Ya", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Control of Guangdong University Engineering Technology Research Center(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Dai-Qi", "Initials": "DQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965553", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201609162"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
