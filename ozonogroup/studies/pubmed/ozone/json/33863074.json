Each ozone regime was split into high and low soil nutrient regimes by watering plants with either a 0.05 % or a 0.005% solution of a fertilizer which contained macronutrients and micronutrients. Fertilization had a strong effect on plant growth, enzyme activities and the expression of ozone-induced effects at the biochemical level. The activities of PEPC and Rubisco were enhanced about threefold in the plants with high fertilization (HF). Significant effects of ozone were in most cases found only in the older leaves of the plants with low fertilization (LF), There, sucrose, glucose and fructose levels were enhanced. In both fertilization treatments, the number of starch granules along the minor veins was increased. These ozone effects point to a decreased or inhibited phloem loading. The increased PEPC activity and the enhanced malate levels in the ozone-exposed plants might be the result of a redirection of carbon flow from sucrose synthesis and translocation towards anapleurotic processes, which can feed detoxification and repair of ozone injury as indicated by enhanced respiration. These findings agree well with the observed effects of ozone in lowering the root: shoot biomass ratio. Although there was a marked reduction in the O<sub>3</sub> /LF plants, O<sub>3</sub> /HF plants showed no significant response. Inositol was decreased under ozone exposure in both fertilizer treatments, contrasting with the pattern for carbohydrates. These results demonstrate the role of fertilization as an important modifier of ozone-induced effects at the plant biochemical level. Well fertilized plants appear to cope better with the impact of ozone on metabolism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Landolt", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcnthardt-Goerg", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfenninger", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Botanik, Eberhard-Karh-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, D-72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Einig", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Botanik, Eberhard-Karh-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, D-72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hampp", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maurer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Forstbotanik, Ludwig Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t Munchen, D-85354 Freising, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "B\u00fccker J, Guderian R. 1994.
