The results showed that the mean <i>\u03c6</i>(TVOCs) at site A and site B in an industrial area and at a third urban site were 105.25\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, 222.92\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and 82.87\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, respectively. Monochloromethane, dichloromethane, acetone, ethanol, and ethane were the species with higher volume fractions at the three sites. Aromatic hydrocarbons and OVOCs had a large contribution to the ozone formation potential (OFP), with a cumulative contribution of more than 50%, and the main reactive species were methyl methacrylate, toluene, <i>p</i>-xylene, and <i>o</i>-xylene; the secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP) of aromatic hydrocarbons contributed more than 80%, with the main active species being toluene, <i>p</i>-xylene, and <i>o</i>-xylene. The results of PMF source analysis showed six main sources of VOCs, in the descending order of the petrochemical industry (21.83%), industrial waste incineration (18.6%), pharmaceutical manufacturing (16.99%), fossil fuel combustion (16.03%), motor vehicle exhaust (14.23%), and chemical manufacturing (12.32%). The mean values of the hazard index (HI) of site A and site B in the industrial area and in the urban site were 0.55, 0.68, and 0.41, respectively, and the mean lifetime cancer risk (LCR) values were 6.71\u00d710<sup>-6</sup>, 6.72\u00d710<sup>-6</sup>, and 6.58\u00d710<sup>-6</sup>, respectively. Both HI and LCR in industrial areas were larger than those in urban areas. The quantitative assessment of risk sources showed that motor vehicle exhaust and fossil fuel combustion contributed relatively high carcinogenic risks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 401331, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Resources, Chongqing Technology and Business University, Chongqing 400067, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Resources, Chongqing Technology and Business University, Chongqing 400067, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Yu-Hang", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 401331, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Xin", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Resources, Chongqing Technology and Business University, Chongqing 400067, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Ming-Min", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34989494", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202105176"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
