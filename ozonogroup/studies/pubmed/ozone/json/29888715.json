Temporary crowns were applied to each patient on the same session as the surgery. Implants were divided into four treatment groups (Group 1: low-level laser therapy (LLLT) group, Group 2: ozone therapy group, Group 3: different protocol of ozone therapy group, and Group 4: control group) each with 25 implants. The irradiations were performed with a gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode low-level laser (Laser BTL-4000) to Group 1. Ozone therapy was performed using an ozone generator (OzoneDTA) with an intraoral probe to Group 2 and Group 3.", "In this study, the overall implant survival rate was 92% after a 6-month observation period. The implant stability quotient values were found significantly higher in Group 1 (LLLT group) and Group 3 (different protocol of ozone therapy group) than the other groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Group 2 (ozone therapy group) and the control group (P > 0.05).", "Our results suggest that both LLLT and ozone therapy with prolonged application time are promising methods to enhance bone healing around immediately loaded implants and increase implant stability; however, there is a need for more studies on this subject for these methods to become routine applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Gazi University, Faculty of Dentistry, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karaca", "ForeName": "I R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Gazi University, Faculty of Dentistry, Mersin, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ergun", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Gazi University, Faculty of Dentistry, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozturk", "ForeName": "D N", "Initials": "DN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101150032"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Implants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Implantation, Endosseous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Implants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Semiconductor"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Low-Level Light Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osseointegration"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29888715", "10.4103/njcp.njcp_82_17", "NigerJClinPract_2018_21_6_703_234051"]}}]}
