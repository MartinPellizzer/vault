Samples were analyzed using direct injection liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry detection or gas chromatography-electron capture detection after liquid-liquid extraction. Many pesticides were reactive via hydrolysis and/or chlorination and ozonation mechanisms under typical drinking water treatment conditions, with less reactivity exhibited on average for chlorine dioxide, monochloramine, hydrogen peroxide, and UV(254). The pyrazole and organophosphorous pesticides were most reactive in general, whereas carbamates and others were less reactive. The screening study provides guidance for the pesticide/oxidation systems that are most likely to lead to degradates in water treatment and the environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri 66044, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chamberlain", "ForeName": "Evelyn", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Honglan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tongwen", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yinfa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fulmer", "ForeName": "Alice", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "Craig", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22141915", "10.1021/jf2033158"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
