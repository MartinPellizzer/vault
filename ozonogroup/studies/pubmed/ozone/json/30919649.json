The cavities were divided into 2 groups: the ozone group received treatment with Healozone X4, while the control group did not receive any treatment. Dentin samples were taken from both groups using two sterile multi-blade drills at 800 rpm without irrigation. The drills were then stored in separate tubes, each containing 5ml of RTF (Reduced Transport Fluid) and placed in culture for the next two hours. A total microbial count of the CFU of Streptococcus Mutans and Lactobacillus was performed.", "From the analysis of data on the dentin samples treated with ozone, there is a decrease in the bacterial load present in the infected carious dentin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Dental School Catholic University of Our Lady of Good Counsel of Tirane, Tirane, Albania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Libonati", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Translational Medicine, Dental School, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Taranto", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Translational Medicine, Dental School, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mea", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Translational Medicine, Dental School, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montemurro", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Translational Medicine, Dental School, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallusi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Translational Medicine, Dental School, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Angotti", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Translational Medicine, Dental School, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nardi", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Istituto Stomatologico Italiano (ISI), Milan, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paglia", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, Dental School, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marzo", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Translational Medicine, Dental School, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campanella", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Paediatr Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101121881", "ISSNLinking": "1591-996X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30919649", "10.23804/ejpd.2019.20.01.14"]}}]}
