By controlling the surface properties of polyurethane acrylate (PUA) stamping molds with ultraviolet (UV)-ozone (UVO) exposure, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS), BHJ layer, and metal cathode were uniformly transferred layer by layer onto each of the bottom layers. Among several interfaces between each layer, we found that the interface between the active layer and metal cathode is a critical factor in obtaining conventional device-like efficiency. To enhance the interfacial connectivity between the BHJ layer and metal cathode and increase electron extraction from the BHJ layer, a titanium oxide (TiOx) interlayer was introduced. Cell performance was optimized by controlling the concentration of TiOx solution. The poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PC60BM) BHJ device fabricated by transferring PEDOT/PSS, TiOx/active layer, and Al cathode showed 2.01% power conversion efficiency. This efficiency is not comparable to those of conventional OPVs, but our approach shows the possibility of fabricating OPVs via the layer-by-layer transfer method for the first time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT) and School of Chemical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon 440-746, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jung Kyu", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Wanjung", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong Hwan", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Haksoo", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Sung M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Dae-Geun", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong Hyeok", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23544664", "10.1021/la400137g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
