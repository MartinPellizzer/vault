The induction of TNFalpha and MnSOD were examined in a model of progressive pulmonary fibrosis along the length of the alveolar duct in rats exposed for 1, 5, and 8 weeks to a combination of 0.8 ppm ozone and 14.4 ppm nitrogen dioxide. This oxidant injury model results in a triphasic response with an initial inflammatory stage during weeks 1-3, followed by a partial resolution at weeks 4-5, and a final stage of rapidly progressive fibrosis during weeks 6-8. Changes in TNFalpha and MnSOD labeling for the proximal and distal alveolar ducts of the lungs were quantified using immunohistochemistry and morphometric techniques at 1, 5, and 8 weeks of exposure. A significant elevation in MnSOD was noted in alveolar macrophages and interstitial cells of the proximal and distal portions of the alveolar duct following 8 weeks of exposure. Labeling for TNFalpha only in the proximal region of the alveolar duct, was significantly increased in alveolar macrophages after 1 and 8 weeks of exposure, while a significant increase in TNFalpha labeling of interstitial cells in proximal regions was noted at all time points. We conclude that MnSOD is elevated in areas of focal injury as well as the more distal protected areas of the lungs, while TNFalpha correlates strongly with both the temporal and spatial aspects of greatest cellular injury in the lungs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Comparative Respiratory Biology and Medicine, California Regional Primate Research Center, Institute of Toxicology and Environmental Health, University of California, Davis 95616, USA. blweller@ucdavis.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weller", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Witschi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinkerton", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES05707", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RR00169", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10774828", "10.1093/toxsci/54.2.452"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
