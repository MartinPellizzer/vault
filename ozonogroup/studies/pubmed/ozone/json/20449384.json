This work represents the first kinetic determinations of the system and focuses on the temperature-dependence of alkene ozonolysis, which is an important tropospheric process impacting upon climate and human health, yet few studies have investigated these reactions as a function of temperature. Temperature-dependent rate coefficients have been established for 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene and 4-methyl-1-pentene at 217-301 K and atmospheric pressure. The derived Arrhenius expressions are as follows: k = (2.68+2.23-1.23) x 10-15 exp[-(16.29 +/- 1.20/RT)], k = (7.31+9.39-4.05) x 10-15 exp[-(15.33 +/- 1.84/RT)] and k = (5.21+2.85-1.85) x 10-15 exp[-(15.66 +/- 0.87/RT)] cm3 molecule-1 s-1 for 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene and 4-methyl-1-pentene, respectively.A strong linear correlation has been observed between a simple structure-activity relationship (SAR) and the activation energy, Ea, possessing an R2 value of 0.90. However, no significant correlation was observed for the A-factor. Notwithstanding, with accurate predictions of the SAR for Ea and log k298, values for the A-factor can be retrieved, and hence the prediction of k at any temperature. The newly acquired data agree well with the original SAR and suggest that the factors controlling the rate of ozonolysis reaction are captured accurately by the SAR index."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Centre for Atmospheric Science, The School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Science, The University of Manchester, Simon Building, Brunswick Street, Manchester, UKM13 9PL."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leather", "ForeName": "Kimberley E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McGillen", "ForeName": "Max R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20449384", "10.1039/b919731a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
