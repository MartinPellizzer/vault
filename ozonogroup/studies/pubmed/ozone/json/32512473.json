HD 2967 and a weed, Chenopodium album L. (fat-hen) grown singly and in mix-culture (1:1) using open-top chambers. The competition posed a relatively lesser effect on the growth of fat-hen as compared to the wheat under ambient O<sub>3</sub> at both the sampling time, however, the effects of stress factors (competition and O<sub>3</sub>) were more pronounced at the reproductive stage on both the plants. Fat-hen possess a stronger antioxidative potential against elevated O<sub>3</sub> (eO<sub>3</sub>), irrespective of competition, making it more resistant against the existing stress factors. Significant stimulation in the activities of CAT, POX, GR and SOD in fat-hen and non-enzyme antioxidants (AsA, thiols, and total phenolics) might have helped the plants to pose a superior ROS scavenging potential under competition\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. Strong stimulation of flavonols (kaempferol and quercetin) and phenolic acid (p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid) in fat-hen not only helped the plants to withstand the oxidative damage under eO<sub>3</sub> but also might have influenced the allelopathic interaction (competition\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>). Yield loss in wheat was observed to be larger under competition\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> (33.1%) followed by O<sub>3</sub> (20.5%) than only under competition (16.3%). The study suggests stringent weed management strategies to be established recognizing the existing threat from O<sub>3</sub> to the productivity of a staple crop-wheat."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
