The calculations, performed using recent ab initio PESs, provide an accurate description of the photodissociation dynamics across the Hartley/Huggins absorption bands. The observed photofragment distributions are reproduced in the two electronic dissociation channels. The room temperature absorption spectrum, constructed as a Boltzmann average of many absorption spectra of rotationally excited parent ozone, agrees with experiment in terms of widths and intensities of diffuse structures. The exit channel conical intersection contributes to the coherent broadening of the absorption spectrum and directly affects the product vibrational and translational distributions. The photon energy dependences of these distributions are strikingly different for fragments created along the adiabatic and the diabatic paths through the intersection. They can be used to reverse engineer the most probable geometry of the non-adiabatic transition. The angular distributions, quantified in terms of the anisotropy parameter \u03b2, are substantially different in the two channels due to a strong anticorrelation between \u03b2 and the rotational angular momentum of the fragment O2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Technische Univerist\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Lichtenbergstr. 4, 85747 Garching, Germany."}], "LastName": "Picconi", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Technische Univerist\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Lichtenbergstr. 4, 85747 Garching, Germany."}], "LastName": "Grebenshchikov", "ForeName": "Sergy Yu", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25149790", "10.1063/1.4892919"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
