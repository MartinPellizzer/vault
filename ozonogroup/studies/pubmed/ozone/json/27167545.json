To es timate the association between hospitalization due to pneumonia and particulate pollutants with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 \u00b5m, nitrogen dioxide and ozone, relative risks for hospitalization according to a generalized additive model of Pois son regression, with Lags of up to five days, were calculated. A percentage increase (PI) was obtained for relative risk (IRR - increase on relative risk) of hospitalization at each 10 \u00b5g/m3 increment in each air pollutants adjusted for the remaining.", "A total of 234 hospitalizations were recorded during these three years.
