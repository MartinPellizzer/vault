In this perspective, Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) has been used to simulate the surface O<sub>3</sub> (SfO<sub>3</sub>) and maximum temperature (T<sub>max</sub>) during NHW (11<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> May 2015) and HW days (21<sup>st</sup>-29<sup>th</sup> May 2015) over southeast (SE), India. The WRF-Chem simulated meteorological and chemical variables have been evaluated against the ERA5 and CAMS reanalysis dataset. A significant correlation of 55-95% is found for all the meteorological and chemical variables. The influencing parameters shows positive correlation of ozone with temperature, which reaches 75-78\u00a0ppbv under HW condition. Day to day trend analysis reveal an increasing pattern of maximum temperature and SfO<sub>3</sub> concentration under HW condition. During HW, mixing of ozone-rich air aloft with near-surface air leading a rise in SfO<sub>3</sub>, as indicated by both ERA5 (with a maximum Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) of 1000\u00a0m) and WRF-Chem simulations (1600\u00a0m). Furthermore, the diurnal cycle of SfO<sub>3</sub>, temperature, PBLH reaches a peak at afternoon, while the other variables like nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), Relative Humidity (RH) shows a high concentration at night-time. Overall, WRF-Chem model effectively captures the diurnal fluctuations of SfO<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and the meteorological variables during the HW event over the SE, India. Result shows that HW may cause a strong contribution to the rate of increase in SfO<sub>3</sub> (22.17%). Thus, it is required to consider contribution of HW driven ozone when developing long-term strategies to mitigate regional ozone pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
