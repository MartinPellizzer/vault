The ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution in the YRD is getting worse. The UHI effect is a key factor that affects the O<sub>3</sub> level. Understanding the influences of the UHI effect on O<sub>3</sub> concentrations is necessary for improving air quality. In this study, the temporal and spatial relationship between UHI and O<sub>3</sub> in the YRD during 2015 was investigated. The influence factors of UHI effect and O<sub>3</sub> are both natural and artificial. Multi-source remote sensing data, which include land cover, land surface temperature (LST), Normalization Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and digital elevation model (DEM) data, were used to extract surface landscape elements. The results showed that: (1) the average hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration was 61.83\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (30.92\u202fppb), the highest value was 105.32\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (52.66\u202fppb) at 15:00 and the O<sub>3</sub> peak was 82.50\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (41.25\u202fppb) in September. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and temperature have a similar variation trend both in diurnal and monthly. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in coastal stations are higher than those inland. (2) The average daytime UHI intensity was 1.24\u202f\u00b0C, and the daytime O<sub>3</sub> concentration was 80.66\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (40.33\u202fppb). There is a positive relationship between UHI and O<sub>3</sub> in the YRD. The relationship in the central developed cities is higher than that in the northern and southern cities. (3) The related factors influencing UHI and O<sub>3</sub> include surface landscape, topography and population. The LST and NDVI are most important among these factors. (4) Due to various geographical backgrounds, the UHI intensities and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations show obvious spatial differences. This study provides a reference with which to better understand the relationship among UHI, O<sub>3</sub> and related factors. Furthermore, the issues of atmospheric and energy transmission in this region deserve further study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
