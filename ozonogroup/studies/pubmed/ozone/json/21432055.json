The phytotoxic potential of O\u2083 was first observed on grape foliage by B.L. Richards and coworkers in 1958 (Richards et al. 1958). To date, unsustainable resource utilization has turned this secondary pollutant into a major component of global climate change and a prime threat to agricultural production. The projected levels to which O\u2083 will increase are critically alarming and have become a major issue of concern for agriculturalists, biologists, environmentalists and others plants are soft targets for O\u2083. Ozone enters plants through stomata, where it disolves in the apoplastic fluid. O\u2083 has several potential effects on plants: direct reaction with cell membranes; conversion into ROS and H\u2082O\u2082 (which alters cellular function by causing cell death); induction of premature senescence; and induction of and up- or down-regulation of responsive components such as genes , proteins and metabolites. In this review we attempt to present an overview picture of plant O\u2083 interactions. We summarize the vast number of available reports on plant responses to O\u2083 at the morphological, physiological, cellular, biochemical levels, and address effects on crop yield, and on genes, proteins and metabolites. it is now clear that the machinery of photosynthesis, thereby decreasing the economic yield of most plants and inducing a common morphological symptom, called the \"foliar injury\". The \"foliar injury\" symptoms can be authentically utilized for biomonitoring of O\u2083 under natural conditions. Elevated O\u2083 stress has been convincingly demonstrated to trigger an antioxidative defense system in plants. The past several years have seen the development and application of high-throughput omics technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) that are capable of identifying and prolifiling the O\u2083-responsive components in model and nonmodel plants. Such studies have been carried out ans have generated an inventory of O\u2083-Responsive components--a great resource to the scientific community. Recently, it has been shown that certain organic chemicals ans elevated CO\u2082 levels are effective in ameliorating O\u2083-generated stress. Both targeted and highthroughput approaches have advanced our knowledge concerning what O\u2083-triggerred signaling and metabolic pathways exist in plants. Moreover, recently generated information, and several biomarkers for O\u2083, may, in the future, be exploited to better screen and develop O\u2083-tolerant plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory for Biotechnology and Biochemistry, Kathmandu, Nepal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Kyoungwon", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "Supriya", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torres", "ForeName": "N L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Madhoolika", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarkar", "ForeName": "Abhijit", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibato", "ForeName": "Junko", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Ganesh K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rakwal", "ForeName": "Randeep", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Rev Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8703602", "ISSNLinking": "0179-5953"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21432055", "10.1007/978-1-4419-8453-1_3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
