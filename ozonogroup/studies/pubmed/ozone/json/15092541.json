Exposure statistics examined included peak (maximum daily hourly) and mean concentrations above specific threshold levels, and concentrations during specific time periods of the day. Peak and mean statistics weighted for ozone concentration and time period statistics weighted for hour of the day were also determined. Polynomial regression analysis was used to relate each of 163 ozone statistics to crop yield. Performance of the various statistics was rated by comparing residual mean square (RMS) values. The analyses demonstrated that no single statistic was best for all crop species. Ozone statistics with a threshold level performed well for most crops, but optimum threshold level was dependent upon crop species and varied with the particular statistics calculated. The data indicated that daily hours of exposure above a critical high-concentration threshold related well to crop yield for alfalfa, market tomatoes, and dry beans. The best statistic for cotton yield was an average of all daily peak ozone concentrations. Several different types of ozone statistics performed similarly for processing tomatoes. These analyses suggest that several ozone summary statistics should be examined in assessing the relationship of ambient ozone exposure to crop yield. Where no clear statistical preference is indicated among several statistics, those most biologically relevant should be selected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, California, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Musselman", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCool", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Younglove", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092541", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90025-5", "0269749188900255"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
