Kinetic experiments were conducted by adding pulses of a concentrated caffeine solution to ozone saturated water. The results showed a rapid decrease of ozone concentration during the first 15s after injection, followed by a gradual decline at a much slower rate. The data were fitted to a second order kinetic model with rate constants increasing from 0.25 to 1.05 M(-1)s(-1) for pH in the 3-10 range. The initial ozone consumption per mol of ozonated caffeine was greater at high pH values, reflecting a higher ozone decomposition rate. The decomposition of ozone was positively affected by the concentration of caffeine, an effect that could be attributed to the presence of a reaction intermediate from the ozonation of caffeine that behaved as a strong promoter of ozone decomposition. A study of the transformation products identified by liquid chromatography in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was carried out, which permitted a tentative degradation pathway to be proposed and several persistent by-products to be identified at both pH 3 and 8. Most transformation products were the result of the opening of the imidazole ring after breaking caffeine's N9C8 double bond."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alcal\u00e1, 28771 Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain. roberto.rosal@uah.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosal", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perdig\u00f3n-Mel\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Antonio", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petre", "ForeName": "Alice", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Calvo", "ForeName": "Eloy", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ag\u00fcera", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Alba", "ForeName": "Amadeo R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G6A5W338E", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19036403", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.10.010", "S0045-6535(08)01280-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
