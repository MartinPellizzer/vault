In this research, a high-performance pressure sensor based on microstructured carbon nanotube/polydimethylsiloxane arrays was fabricated using an ultra-violet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>) microengineering technique. The UV/O<sub>3</sub> microengineering technique is controllable, cost-effective, and highly efficient since it is conducted at room temperature in an ambient environment. The pressure sensor offers a broad pressure sensing range (7 Pa-50 kPa), a sensitivity of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.101\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005 kPa<sup>-1</sup> (<1 kPa), a fast response/relaxation speed of \u223c10 ms, a small dependence on temperature variation, and a good cycling stability (>5000 cycles), which is attributed to the UV/O<sub>3</sub> engineered microstructures that amplify and transfer external applied forces and rapidly store/release the energy during the PDMS deformation. The sensors developed show the capability to detect external forces and monitor human health conditions, promising for the potential applications in electronic skin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical and Power Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Guohui", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jingdong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yongfeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xuan", "ForeName": "Fuzhen", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29339577", "10.1088/1361-6528/aaa855"]}}]}
