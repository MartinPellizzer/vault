In our previous work, we have demonstrated in that O<sub>3</sub> exposure alters the Cl<sup>-</sup> current-voltage relationship, with the appearance of a large outward rectifier component mainly sustained by outward rectifier chloride channels (ORCCs) in human lung epithelial cells (A549 line). In the present study, we have performed patch clamp experiments, in order to identify which one of the O<sub>3</sub> byproducts (4hydroxynonenal (HNE) and/or H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) was responsible for chloride current change. While 4HNE exposition (up to 25\u2009\u03bcM for 30' before electrophysiological analysis) did not reproduce O<sub>3</sub> effect, H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> produced by glucose oxidase 10\u2009mU for 24\u2009hr before electrophysiological analysis mimicked O<sub>3</sub> response. This result was confirmed treating the cell with catalase (CAT) before O<sub>3</sub> exposure (1,000\u2009U/ml for 2\u2009hr): CAT was able to rescue Cl<sup>-</sup> current alteration. Since CAT is regulated by Nrf2 transcription factor, we pre-treated the cells with the Nrf2 activators, resveratrol and tBHQ. Immunochemical and immunocytochemical results showed Nrf2 activation with both substances that lead to prevent OS effect on Cl<sup>-</sup> current. These data bring new insights into the mechanisms involved in OS-induced lung tissue damage, pointing out the role of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in chloride current alteration and the ability of Nfr2 activation in preventing this effect."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Canella", "ForeName": "Rita", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Benedusi", "ForeName": "Mascia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Martini", "ForeName": "Marta", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Cervellati", "ForeName": "Franco", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Cavicchio", "ForeName": "Carlotta", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8792-0947"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Plants for Human Health Institute, NC State University, Kannapolis, North Carolina."}], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloride Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NFE2L2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloride Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29271475", "10.1002/jcp.26416"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
