The substances used in the disinfection of water are known as disinfectants. At municipal level, chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), chloramines (NH<sub>2</sub>Cl, NHCl<sub>2</sub>), chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and ultraviolet (UV) radiations, are the most commonly used disinfectants. Chlorination, because of its removal efficiency and cost effectiveness, has been widely used as method of disinfection of water. But, disinfection process may add several kinds of disinfection by-products (DBPs) (\u223c600-700 in numbers) in the treated water such as Trihalomethanes (THM), Haloacetic acids (HAA) etc. which are detrimental to the human beings in terms of cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity. In water, THMs and HAAs were observed in the range from 0.138 to 458\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 0.16-136\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively. Thus, several regulations have been specified by world authorities like WHO, USEPA and Bureau of Indian Standard to protect human health. Some techniques have also been developed to remove the DBPs as well as their precursors from the water. The popular techniques of DBPs removals are adsorption, advance oxidation process, coagulation, membrane based filtration, combined approaches etc. The efficiency of adsorption technique was found up to 90% for DBP removal from the water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
