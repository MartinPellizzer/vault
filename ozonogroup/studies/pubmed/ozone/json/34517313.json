The disordered atomic arrangement structure of SMPC-\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies, which was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), O<sub>2</sub>-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), H<sub>2</sub>-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) analyses. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) also proved that reducing the crystallinity of \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> decreased the formation energy of oxygen vacancies. TPD and in situ DRIFT analyses of NH<sub>3</sub> adsorption suggested that the surface acidity of SMPC-\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was considerably higher than those of mesoporous poorly crystalline \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (MPC-\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and highly crystalline \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (HC-\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The oxygen vacancies and acid sites formed on \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> surface are beneficial for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) decomposition. Compared with MPC-\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and HC-\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SMPC-\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibited a higher removal efficiency for 200-ppm O<sub>3</sub> at a space velocity of 720\u00a0L\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> at 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C under dry conditions. Additionally, in situ DRIFT and XPS results suggested that the accumulation of peroxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and the conversion of O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> to lattice oxygen over the oxygen vacancies caused catalyst deactivation. However, O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> could be desorbed completely by continuous N<sub>2</sub> purging at approximately 350\u00a0\u00b0C. This study provides significant insights for developing highly active \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
