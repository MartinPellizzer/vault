Here, we report the realization of efficient perovskite solar cells grown directly on fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated substrates without using any hole-blocking layers. With ultraviolet-ozone treatment of the substrates, a planar Au/hole-transporting material/CH\u2083NH\u2083PbI\u2083-xClx/substrate cell processed by a solution method has achieved a power conversion efficiency of over 14% and an open-circuit voltage of 1.06\u2009V measured under reverse voltage scan. The open-circuit voltage is as high as that of our best reference cell with a TiO\u2082 hole-blocking layer. Besides ultraviolet-ozone treatment, we find that involving Cl in the synthesis is another key for realizing high open-circuit voltage perovskite solar cells without hole-blocking layers. Our results suggest that TiO\u2082 may not be the ultimate interfacial material for achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
