In this paper long-term operational results for a process that combines the oxidative ozone pretreatment with anaerobic sludge digestion are described. The ozone pretreatment solubilized around 19% and 37% of the solids at 0.015 and 0.05 gO3/gTS ozone dose. The solubilization ratios during ozonation did not show any significant difference for the sludge concentrations ranging from 1.8-2.6%. The TVS concentrations after ozone treatment were observed to be about 3% lower than the feed sludge concentrations suggesting only partial mineralization during ozonation. The ozone pretreatment resulted in improved solid reduction efficiencies during anaerobic digestion leading to higher methane recovery. The TVS removal efficiencies during anaerobic digestion were observed to increase by a maximum of 35-90% depending on the applied ozone dose during ozone pretreatment. The improvement in TVS degradation efficiency at different applied ozone doses correlated well with the extent of solubilization during ozonation. Long-term data also suggested that biomass acclimation to ozonated sludge was necessary before higher degradation efficiencies could be achieved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kurita Water Industries, Research and Development Center, 7-1, Wakamiya, Morinosato, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan 243-0124. rajeev.goel@kurita.co.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goel", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tokutomi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yasui", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Anaerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12926690"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
