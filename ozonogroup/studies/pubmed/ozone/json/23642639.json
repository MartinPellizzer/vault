Theoretical results showed that, OH radical degraded 2,3,7,8-TCDD via substituting chlorine at the 2,3,7,8 positions, while O3 radical degraded 2,3,7,8-TCDD via destructing CC bonds and aromatic ring. Based on the mechanism study, the kinetic parameters of the reactions were also calculated by Transition State Theory. By comparing, the rate constant of the 2,3,7,8-TCDD destruction by OH was found to be much higher than that by O3, which indicated that OH radical have much stronger ability to degrade 2,3,7,8-TCDD than O3 radical. This finding was consistent with the standard electrode potential of OH and O3 radical. The theoretical results in this paper can be believed to supply important theory basis for the further investigation on dioxins removal by using the catalytic oxidation technology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
