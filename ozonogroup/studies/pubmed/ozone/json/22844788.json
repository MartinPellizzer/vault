According to data of NHK's survey, it has been lowered by one hour since 1960. The reasons are different between generations. In adolescence, the increased frequency of using internet and convenience store may cause the shortage of sleep and the deterioration of circadian rhythms. In adulthood, the working environment, such as increased number of shift-workers and excessive job time, is getting worse, and it could shorten the sleep time and exacerbate sleep quality. In old age, the frequency of taking medicine becomes higher in connection with aging. We need to be careful about the interactions between hypnotics and taking drugs prescribed to treat complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The Jikei University School of Medicine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Motohiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwashita", "ForeName": "Masayuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Rinsho", "NlmUniqueID": "0420546", "ISSNLinking": "0047-1852"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Habits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22844788"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
