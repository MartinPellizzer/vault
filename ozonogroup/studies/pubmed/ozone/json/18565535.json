It was found that the presence of low concentrations of these compounds (1 mg/L) during SDBS ozonation increases both the ozone decomposition rate and the rate of SDBS removal from the medium. Because of the low reactivity of SDBS with ozone, these effects are mainly due to an increase in the transformation rate of ozone into HO(*) radicals. Results obtained demonstrate that the presence of GAL and HUM during SDBS ozonation increases the concentration of O(2)(-*) radicals in the medium, confirming that GAL and HUM act as initiating agents of ozone transformation into HO(*). It was also found that this effect was smaller with a larger molecular size of the acid. Presence of GAL and HUM during SDBS removal by O(3)/H(2)O(2), O(3)/GAC, and O(3)/PAC systems also increases the SDBS degradation rate, confirming the role of these compounds as initiators of ozone transformation into HO(*) radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain. jrivera@ugr.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivera-Utrilla", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez-Polo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00e9ndez-D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferro-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bautista-Toledo", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Colloid Interface Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0043125", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9797"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18565535", "10.1016/j.jcis.2008.05.060", "S0021-9797(08)00733-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
