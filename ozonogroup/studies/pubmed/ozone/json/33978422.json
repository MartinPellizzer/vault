It is experimentally shown that the OH radical-initiated oxidation of trimethylamine, the most highly emitted amine in the atmosphere, proceeds via rapid autoxidation steps dominating its atmospheric oxidation process. All three methyl groups are functionalized within a timescale of 10 s following the reaction with OH radicals leading to highly oxidized products. The exceptionally large density of functional groups in the oxidized products is expected to define their chemical properties. A detailed reaction mechanism based on theoretical calculations is able to describe the experimental findings. The comparison with results of the reinvestigated OH radical- and ozone-initiated autoxidation of a series of terpenes and aromatics reveals the trimethylamine process as the most efficient one discovered up to now for atmospheric conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2014-6018"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Chemistry Department (ACD), Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS), Permoserstra\u00dfe 15, Leipzig 04318, Germany."}], "LastName": "Berndt", "ForeName": "Torsten", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8070-8516"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 5, Copenhagen \u00d8 DK-2100, Denmark."}], "LastName": "M\u00f8ller", "ForeName": "Kristian H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7044-2101"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Chemistry Department (ACD), Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS), Permoserstra\u00dfe 15, Leipzig 04318, Germany."}], "LastName": "Herrmann", "ForeName": "Hartmut", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7275-8297"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 5, Copenhagen \u00d8 DK-2100, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Kjaergaard", "ForeName": "Henrik G", "Initials": "HG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33978422", "10.1021/acs.jpca.1c02465"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
