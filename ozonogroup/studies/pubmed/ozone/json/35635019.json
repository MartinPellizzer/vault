In this article, we report for the first time a simple and straightforward method for self-repairing surface dewettability over a long period of time by rapidly regenerating surface microstructures. We selected paraffin wax as a matrix for methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) having strong reactivity with moisture/water and simply mixed them. When the as-prepared MTCS-loaded paraffin wax surfaces were exposed to air for a few hours, they spontaneously became highly hydrophobic with water contact angles of about 150\u00b0 due to the formation of disordered surface microstructures. The use of paraffin wax with a few angstrom-scale space as a matrix was found to be more effective than the use of poly(dimethylsiloxane) with nanometer-size porosity in preventing both evaporation and degradation of MTCS's chemical reactivity for a long period. Therefore, for about 1 month, even after the surface microstructures were completely destroyed, surface dewettability could be self-repaired by rapidly regenerating surface morphologies. In addition, chemical damage by UV/ozone exposure could also be repeatably self-healed by the reconstruction of surface chemical makeup. We thus expect that this simple approach could provide future insights to impart the self-healing ability of manmade superhydrophobic materials/surfaces against chemical and physical damages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 2266-98, Anagahora, Shimoshidami, Moriyama, Nagoya 463-8560, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7854-927X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN), The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4072, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamauchi", "ForeName": "Yusuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4375-3785"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 2266-98, Anagahora, Shimoshidami, Moriyama, Nagoya 463-8560, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hozumi", "ForeName": "Atsushi", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35635019", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c00956"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
