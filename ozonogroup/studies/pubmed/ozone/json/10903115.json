A great number of these compounds are recalcitrant and shown carcinogenic or mutagenic character. In this work three processes were studied for degradation of an anthraquinone dye (C.I. reactive blue-19). The ozonation process leads to complete decolorization with a very short reaction time; however, effective mineralization of the dye was not observed. The enzymatic process promotes quick decolorization of the dye; nevertheless, maximum decolorization degrees of about 30% are insignificant in relation to the decolorization degree achieved by the other processes. The best results were found for the photocatalytical process. The use of ZnO or TiO2 as photocatalysts, permits total decolorization and mineralization of the dye with reaction times of about 60 min."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal do Parana, CP 19081, Curitiba, Brazil. zamora@quimica.ufpr.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peralta-Zamora", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kunz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomes de Morae S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pelegrini", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Campos Moleiro P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reyes", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duran", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10903115", "10.1016/s0045-6535(98)00227-6", "S0045653598002276"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
