In this study, the vertical profiles of VOCs were created for the southern Taiwan industrial city of Kaohsiung. Vertical air samples were collected up to 1000\u202fm using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In Renwu District, VOC distribution was affected by the inversion layer up to 200\u202fm height. Total VOCs (36-327\u202fppbv), OFP (66-831\u202fppbv) and SOAFP (0.12-5.55\u202fppbv) stratified by height were the highest values at 300\u202fm. The VOCs originated from both local and long-distance transport sources. These findings can be integrated into Kaohsiung's future air quality improvement plans and serve as a reference for other industrialized areas worldwide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
