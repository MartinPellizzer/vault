All had been previously identified in a cross sectional survey of a random sample of a rural population. Atopy was assessed by means of skin prick tests, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), and radioallergosorbent test (RAST) assays. Bronchial reactivity (PC20) was measured by histamine challenge. Total IgE and bronchial reactivity were measured both before and during the oilseed rape flowering season. Day to day changes were monitored by subjects who kept a record of their symptoms and peak flow morning and evening, starting before the flowering season and continuing during it and into the grass pollen season.", "Only two cases, of 23 tested, showed evidence of allergy to oilseed rape and only 10 of 23 tested, including these two, were atopic. Eye, nasal, and headache symptoms increased in the season in cases, which validated the questionnaire used in the previous cross sectional survey. 12 of 16 cases tested and seven of 15 controls showed a seasonal fall in PC20; the fall in the cases was significantly greater than in the controls. Peak flow charts showed no evidence of fall or of increased variability during the season.", "People who complained of symptoms in relation to the flowering of oilseed rape were rarely allergic to the plant and fewer than half were atopic. Nevertheless, they usually showed increased bronchial reactivity during the season, which may have been due in some cases to other allergens but in others to non-specific irritant effects of the air. Whether these are due to chemicals released by the crop, to rising summer ozone levels, or to other factors remains unclear."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, University Medical School, Foresterhill, Aberdeen."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soutar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harker", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seaton", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Packe", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9422759", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Immediate"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intradermal Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioallergosorbent Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Hypersensitivity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "BMJ. 1989 Apr 22;298(6680):1068-70", "ArticleIdList": ["2497892"]}, {"Citation": "Acta Allergol. 1954;7(4):367-9", "ArticleIdList": ["13206589"]}, {"Citation": "Contact Dermatitis. 1985 Aug;13(2):121-2", "ArticleIdList": ["4064648"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1993 Feb 20;306(6876):487-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8448458"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Allergy. 1977 May;7(3):235-43", "ArticleIdList": ["908121"]}, {"Citation": "Scand J Respir Dis. 1978 Aug;59(4):222-7", "ArticleIdList": ["694477"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Exp Allergy. 1994 Dec;24(12):1105-14", "ArticleIdList": ["7889423"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 1990 Jan 13;335(8681):121-2", "ArticleIdList": ["1967414"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Invest Med. 1990 Apr;13(2):60-6", "ArticleIdList": ["2191815"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1993 May;147(5):1138-43", "ArticleIdList": ["8484622"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1994 Apr;49(4):352-6", "ArticleIdList": ["8202906"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1994 Dec 17;309(6969):1618", "ArticleIdList": ["7819938"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 1990 Sep 29;336(8718):808", "ArticleIdList": ["1976161"]}, {"Citation": "Vet Rec. 1992 Aug 22;131(8):163-7", "ArticleIdList": ["1413430"]}, {"Citation": "Eur Respir J Suppl. 1993 Mar;16:5-40", "ArticleIdList": ["8499054"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Exp Allergy. 1992 Apr;22(4):501-5", "ArticleIdList": ["1611550"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7550796", "PMC1128309", "10.1136/oem.52.9.575"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
