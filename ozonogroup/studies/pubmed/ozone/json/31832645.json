Methyl bromide had been widely used for the disinfestation of dry-cured ham facilities in the United States, but is now phased out of use since it is an ozone-depleting substance. This paper reports laboratory studies to evaluate the efficacies of methyl bromide and phosphine for controlling two of the key arthropod pests of dry-cured hams and aged cheeses. Larvae of the red-legged ham beetle, Necrobia rufipes (Fabricius), were the most tolerant life stages when treated with either phosphine or methyl bromide for 48 h exposure at 23\u00b0C, whereas eggs of the mold mite, Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank), were slightly more tolerant than mobile stages for both compounds. Under laboratory conditions, complete control was achieved for the both species with concentrations of 0.85 and 4.0 g/m3 of phosphine and methyl bromide, respectively, at 48 h exposure. The results give new information for judicious use of the existing stocks of methyl bromide, whether for pest mitigation or to help in developing a quarantine treatment schedule with that gas. Phosphine shows good potential as an effective alternative to methyl bromide, but if it was to be adopted as a fumigant in the dry-cured ham industry, methods to prevent metal corrosion would need to be designed and effectively implemented."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
