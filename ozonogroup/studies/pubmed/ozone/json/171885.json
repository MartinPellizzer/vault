Polio virus type I was chosen with regard to its epidemiological behaviour and high stability in drinking-water and sewage lines. In view of the lack of propagation techniques, hepatitis viruses A and B, unfortunately, could not be used for these experiments. The experiments were done under laboratory conditions only, and not in the water recovery plant because of hygienic reasons. Defined quantities of disinfectants were examined for their virus-inactivating effect in water without redox-potential (double-distilled water), water with low defined redox-potential (double-distilled water + KOH), previously chlorinated water with a residual chlorine content of 0.03 mg chlorine per liter (tap water) and water with a high redox-potential (well water from the drinking-water plant). Time-course studies were performed, both with chlorine and ozone, in order to evaluate the characteristics of the inactivation procedure. The experimental conditions chosen varied from experiment to experiment to obtain relevant conclusions for the practice. On the basis of our results, and taking into account the quantitative differences in effect, chlorine and ozone principially can be considered equivalent in their action of virus-disinfection. Both, the initial rate and the kinetics of virus disinfection are really identical. Both disinfectants are dependant on the condition of the water (redox-potential, pH etc.) to a great extent in their efficacy. Therefore, a decision of whether or not ozone should substitute for chlorine for the drinking-water supply in Essen cannot be drawn on the basis of virological experiments. This decision, then, depends more or less on other questions - such as relative costs and practicability of the ozonization on a large technical scale. The safety risk and technical reliability of the ozonization process is of particular significance. In the present condition of the Essen reservoir water, a good virus disinfection can be expected already with 1.0 to 1.5 mg ozone/liter (dissolved!); such a concentration guarantees very little residual ozone and, thus, makes then this procedure technically feasible. Continuous checking of the redox-potential and the amount of the ozone added is necessary. With regard to a continuous supply of ozone, the dependence on current supply must be guaranteed. Ozonization of water, probably by the cleavage of humic acid, promotes bacterial recontamination of the drinking-water in the city taps(Stalder und Klosterk\u00f6tter, 45). Therefore only a combined pre-ozonization with subsequent chlorination would guarantee, both, safety and improvement of the cosmetical conditions of the drinking-water. Such a combination would be feasible with highly reduced amounts of ozone and chlorine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thraenhart", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuwert", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Vergleichende Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Wirkung von Chlor und Ozon auf Polioviren bei der Trinkwasseraufbereitung der Stadt Essen."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Zentralbl Bakteriol Orig B", "NlmUniqueID": "1306477"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany, West"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Poliovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["171885"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
