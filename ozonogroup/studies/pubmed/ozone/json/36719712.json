The ionization of dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) under the irradiation of 10.0 and 10.6 eV light was investigated. CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> was observed at 10 Pa, while both CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> and CHCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> were observed at higher pressure. The production efficiency of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> decreased with the increasing number density of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, while that of CHCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> increased. A kinetic model was successfully derived to quantitatively describe the variation trends of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> and CHCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, in which the competition between photoinduced ion-pair and photodissociation-assisted photoionization (PD-PI) were included. The ion-pair channel was quenched efficiently at higher pressure or concentration, which reduced its contribution. Our study proposed new insights into the complicated photoexcitation behaviors of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> in the VUV regime and revealed the important role of photodissociation in photoionization at low photon flux."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4431-3207"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing100049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jichun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6430-1337"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chuang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing100049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yiqian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Weiguo", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing100049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing100049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Zhigang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6658-4745"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning116023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Haiyang", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101526034", "ISSNLinking": "1948-7185"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36719712", "10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c03572"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
