Two bioassays, the Kirby-Bauer test and the broth microdilution assay, were used to measure changes in the antimicrobial activity of solutions at low LEV to O3 molar ratios (2:1, 2:3 and 1:3) compared to solutions without added O3 (LEV:O3 1:0). The Kirby-Bauer test was not sensitive enough to detect significant differences in the growth inhibition zones in samples LEV:O3 2:1 and LEV:O3 1:0; however, the broth microdilution assay showed that bacterial growth inhibition was significantly lower (P<0.001) in the solutions exposed to O3. Loss of antimicrobial activity in LEV:O3 2:1 solutions of (48\u00b116)% was in agreement with the concentration decrease of LEV of (36\u00b13)% in those same samples. A method of identification of OTPs using XCMS Online was applied to LEV:O3 2:1 and 1:0 samples and indicated the presence of an OTP of LEV of formula C18H20O5N3F, which was identified as LEV-N-oxide. The molecular structure of this compound was partially confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry experiments. This study showed that even at sub-optimal ozone doses, OTPs of higher antimicrobial activity than LEV were not formed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, 2500 boulevard de l'Universit\u00e9, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada J1K 2R1 E-mail: pa.segura@usherbrooke.ca."}], "LastName": "Segura", "ForeName": "Pedro A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, 3610 University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3A 0C5."}], "LastName": "Saadi", "ForeName": "Karim", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, 2500 boulevard de l'Universit\u00e9, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada J1K 2R1 E-mail: pa.segura@usherbrooke.ca."}], "LastName": "Clair", "ForeName": "Alexandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, 2500 boulevard de l'Universit\u00e9, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada J1K 2R1 E-mail: pa.segura@usherbrooke.ca."}], "LastName": "Lecours", "ForeName": "Marc-Andr\u00e9", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, 3610 University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3A 0C5."}], "LastName": "Yargeau", "ForeName": "Viviane", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluoroquinolones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33CM23913M", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamazepine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6GNT3Y5LMF", "NameOfSubstance": "Levofloxacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbamazepine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluoroquinolones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Levofloxacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26524449", "10.2166/wst.2015.369"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
