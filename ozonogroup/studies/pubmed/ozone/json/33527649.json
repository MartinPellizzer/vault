Both factors have an intense impact on plants. However, little information is available on the combined and interactive effects of air warming and elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on physiological characteristics of plants. To explore this issue, we studied variations in growth, photosynthesis and physiological characteristics of leaves of Acer ginnala seedlings exposed to control (ambient temperature and O<sub>3</sub> ), increasing air temperature (ambient temperature\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C), elevated O<sub>3</sub> (ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentration\u00a0+\u00a040\u00a0ppb) and a combination of the two abiotic factors at different phenological stages by using open-top chambers. The results showed that increasing air temperature had no significant effect on growth, but increased photosynthesis and antioxidant enzyme activity at the leaf unfolding and defoliation stages. In contrast, elevated O<sub>3</sub> decreased growth and photosynthesis and caused oxidative stress injury in A. ginnala leaves at each phenological stage. The combination of increasing air temperature and elevated O3 improved growth and net photosynthetic rates of tested plants and alleviated the oxidative stress compared to O<sub>3</sub> alone. Our findings demonstrated that moderate warming was beneficial to A. ginnala at leaf unfolding and defoliation stages, and alleviated the adverse effects of O<sub>3</sub> stress on growth, photosynthesis and the antioxidant system. These results will provide a theoretical reference and scientific basis for the adaptation and response of A. ginnala under regional air warming and atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2875-5080"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Shenyang University, 110044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Arboretum, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Arboretum, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Arboretum, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31170573", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "31270518", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "32071597", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "41675153", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "90411019", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acer"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Azevedo R.A., Alas R.M., Smit R.J., Lea P.J.
