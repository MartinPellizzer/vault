The direct microbicidal action of plasma is well documented, being mediated by number of reactive particles with a short lifetime. However, we observed the microbicidal effect also in exposed water stored for a month, where it must be mediated by stable particles. In water and in phosphate-buffered saline, the formation of NO(x) and corresponding acids, H(2)O(2) and O(3) was confirmed after exposition to the low-temperature plasma generated in air by DC negative glow corona and positive streamer discharge. The time course of acidification, H(2)O(2) and O(3) formation were deremined. Except uncertain traces of HCN, SIFT-MS analysis of exposed liquids reveals no additional reactive compounds. The microbicidal effect persists almost unchanged during 4 weeks of storage, although O(3) completely and H(2)O(2) almost disappears. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli were inactivated within 10 min of incubation in exposed liquids, Candida albicans needs at least 1 h. The solutions prepared by artificial mixing of reactive compounds mimic the action of exposed water, but in lesser extent. The acid milieu is the main cause of the microbicidal effect, but the possibility of still unidentified additional compound remains open."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.
