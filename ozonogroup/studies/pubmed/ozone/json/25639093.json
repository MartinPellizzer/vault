The results showed that acetaminophen could be degraded effectively by ozone and degradation of acetaminophen fitted well with the pseudo-first-order kinetics model (R2 > 0.992). The degradation of acetaminophen was promoted with the increase of pH, the concentration of bicarbonate and ozone. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ion chromatography analysis showed that degradation products such as hydroquinone and a series of carboxylic acids were firstly formed during ozonation of acetaminophen. Then, the products were further oxidized. The degradation pathways of acetaminophen were also discussed by the identified products. The result of TOC showed that the mineralization of acetaminophen was ultimately lower. When the initial concentration of acetaminophen was 20 mg x L(-1) and the concentration of ozone was 9.10 mg x L(-1), the mineralization was only 16.42% after 130 min."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Shou-Jun", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Meng-Tao", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zhen-Hu", "Initials": "ZH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25639093"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
