Endometritis is an important cause of subfertility in mares. Considering the antimicrobial characteristics, immune-stimulating ability, and low cost of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) therapy, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intrauterine O<sub>3</sub> therapy as an alternative treatment for endometritis in mares. Twenty-five mares with a known reproductive history of uterine infection and inflammation were allocated into three groups: Group 1 (control; n\u00a0=\u00a07), uterine lavage with Ringer's lactate solution; Group 2 (O<sub>3</sub>-gas; n\u00a0=\u00a09), uterine lavage with Ringer's lactate solution followed by uterine insufflation with O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> gas mixture containing 40 \u00b5g O<sub>3</sub> mL<sup>-1</sup> for 10 minute; and Group 3 (O<sub>3</sub>-oil; n\u00a0=\u00a09), uterine infusion of ozonized sunflower oil. Uterine inflammation was evaluated through a uterine cytological examination (cytobrush) and uterine culture (swab) for microbiological content before and after all treatments. In assessments of uterine cytology, the average number of neutrophils/field changed from 9.14 \u00b1 3.02 to 7.71 \u00b1 3.59 in the control group, from 10.67 \u00b1 3.84 to 2.89 \u00b1 3.59 in the O<sub>3</sub>-gas group, and from 6.44 \u00b1 2.79 to 6.55 \u00b1 7.18 in the O<sub>3</sub>-oil group post-treatment. The pre- and post-treatment findings in the mares treated with ozonized gas were significantly different (P < .05), unlike the findings for the mares in the control and O<sub>3</sub>-oil groups. All mares (25/25) showed a positive uterine culture before treatment. After treatment, the percentage of mares showing positive culture results was 57%, 11%, and 22% in the control, O<sub>3</sub>-gas, and O<sub>3</sub>-oil groups, respectively. Our results showed the effectiveness of two groups (O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> gas mixture and ozonized sunflower oil) for the treatment of uterine infections in mares. Thus, direct intrauterine O<sub>3</sub> gas infusion has been shown to be effective in treating endometritis in mares, reducing both inflammation and uterine infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
