HNPs are generated by biotic and abiotic processes and range in complexity from low molecular mass natural halocarbons (nHCs, mostly halomethanes and haloethanes) to compounds of higher molecular mass which often contain oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms in addition to halogens (hHNPs). nHCs have a key role in regulating tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, while some hHNPs bioaccumulate and have toxic properties similar those of anthropogenic-persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Both chemical classes have common sources: biosynthesis by marine bacteria, phytoplankton, macroalgae, and some invertebrate animals, and both may be similarly impacted by alteration of production and transport pathways in a changing climate. The nHCs scientific community is advanced in investigating sources, atmospheric and oceanic transport, and forecasting climate change impacts through modeling. By contrast, these activities are nascent or nonexistent for hHNPs. The goals of this paper are to (1) review production, sources, distribution, and transport pathways of nHCs and hHNPs through water and air, pointing out areas of commonality, (2) by analogy to nHCs, argue that climate change may alter these factors for hHNPs, and (3) suggest steps to improve linkage between nHCs and hHNPs science to better understand and predict climate change impacts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7469-0532"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University (UmU), SE-901 87 Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Bidleman", "ForeName": "Terry F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology & Environmental Science, UmU, SE-901 87 Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ume\u00e5 Marine Sciences Centre, UmU, SE-905 71 H\u00f6rnefors, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Andersson", "ForeName": "Agneta", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University (UmU), SE-901 87 Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Haglund", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University (UmU), SE-901 87 Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Tysklind", "ForeName": "Mats", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32364720", "10.1021/acs.est.9b07709"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
