Asthma is one such condition, which may be exacerbated by both prolonged adverse in-home exposures if quarantining in unhealthy homes and prolonged outdoor exposures if the ambient air quality is unhealthy or hazardous. As both are often the case in Environmental Justice (EJ) communities, here we have analyzed data at the census tract (CT) level for Louisiana to assess any correlation between social and environmental vulnerability, and health issues like COVID-19 and asthma. Higher Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Particulate Matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5) and Ozone levels were associated with higher rates of cumulative COVID-19 incidence at various time points during the pandemic, as well as higher average annual asthma hospitalization rates and estimated asthma prevalence. Further, cumulative COVID-19 incidence during the first three months of the pandemic was moderately correlated with both asthma hospitalizations and estimated prevalence, suggesting similar underlying factors may be affecting both conditions. Additionally, 137 CTs were identified where social and environmental vulnerabilities co-existed, of which 75 (55%) had high estimated prevalence of asthma. These areas are likely to benefit from asthma outreach that considers both social and environmental risk factors. Fifteen out of the 137 CTs (11%) not only had higher estimated prevalence of asthma but also a high burden of COVID-19. Further research in these areas may help to elucidate any common social determinants of health that underlie both asthma and COVID-19 burdens, as well as better clarify the possible role of the environment as related to the COVID-19 burden in Louisiana."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8483-1597"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Bakshi", "ForeName": "Arundhati", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Van Doren", "ForeName": "Alicia", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Maser", "ForeName": "Colette", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Aubin", "ForeName": "Kathleen", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Stewart", "ForeName": "Collette", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Soileau", "ForeName": "Shannon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Friedman", "ForeName": "Kate", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology, Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Alexis", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Louisiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Vulnerability"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Alcendor DJ.
