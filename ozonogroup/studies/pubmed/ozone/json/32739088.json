The aim of this study was to assess RV systolic and diastolic function in the perioperative period after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB).", "Prospective observational study.", "Tertiary care hospital.", "Thirty adult patients undergoing OPCAB.", "None.", "Transthoracic echocardiography was performed twice: first preoperatively and second postoperatively, when patients were moved to wards. The following five parameters of RV systolic function were used: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), systolic tissue Doppler imaging of lateral tricuspid annulus (S'), fractional area change (FAC), RV myocardial performance index (RIMP), and isovolumic acceleration (IVA). Grading of RV diastolic function (RVDD) was done as per guidelines. Paired t test was used for comparing means and \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test was used for categorical and ordinal data. The parameters of RV longitudinal function (TAPSE and S') reduced significantly (preoperative 21.93 \u00b1 2.80 mm and 13.24 \u00b1 2.24 cm/s to postoperative 11.67 \u00b1 1.91 mm and 10.31 \u00b1 1.56 cm/s, respectively, p < 0.001), whereas parameters of RV global function (FAC, RIMP, and IVA) remained preserved (preoperative 46.75 \u00b1 6.80%, 0.34 \u00b1 0.06, and 4.66 \u00b1 0.87 m/s<sup>2</sup> to postoperative 46.21 \u00b1 6.44%, 0.36 \u00b1 0.06, and 4.37 \u00b1 0.83 m/s<sup>2</sup>; p values of 0.76, 0.13, and 0.11, respectively). The median grade of RVDD worsened from normal in the preoperative period to pseudo-normal in the postoperative period (p < 0.001). The changes in both RV systolic and diastolic function were similar in patients with normal and reduced left ventricular systolic function.", "RV function can be assessed in perioperative settings with two-dimensional and tissue Doppler imaging. For systolic function assessment, exclusive measurement of longitudinal parameters might be inadequate; use of complementary global parameters like FAC, RIMP, and IVA is essential to complete the RV assessment after OPCAB.
