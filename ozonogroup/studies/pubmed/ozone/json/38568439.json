We applied adjusted multivariable modified Poisson regression and linear regression to investigate associations between pollution exposure and relative risk of ILA or increased percent HAA (between -600 and -250 Hounsfield units) respectively. We assessed for effect modification by MUC5B-promoter polymorphism (GT/TT vs GG at rs3705950), smoking status, sex, and percent emphysema.", "Among 1272 participants with COPD assessed for HAA, 424 were current smokers, 249 were carriers of the variant MUC5B allele (GT/TT). 519 participants were assessed for ILA. We found no association between pollution exposure and ILA or HAA. Associations between pollutant exposures and risk of ILA were modified by the presence of MUC5B polymorphism (p-value interaction term for NOx = 0.04 and PM2.5 = 0.05) and smoking status (p-value interaction term for NOx = 0.05, NO2 = 0.01, and O3 = 0.05). With higher exposure to NOx and PM2.5, MUC5B variant carriers had increased risk of ILA (Relative Risk [RR] per 26ppb NOx 2.41; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.97 to 6.0) and RR per 4 \u03bcg\u00b7m-3 PM2.5 1.43; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.2). With higher exposure to NO2, former smokers had increased risk of ILA (RR per 10ppb 1.64; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.7).", "Exposure to ambient air pollution was not associated with interstitial features on CT in this population of heavy smokers with COPD. MUC5B modified the association between pollution and ILA, suggesting that gene-environment interactions may influence prevalence of interstitial lung features in COPD."]}, "AuthorList":
