In the diode laser group, the operator irradiated the superficial dentin exposed with an 808-nm wavelength and incremental power from 0.2 to 0.6\u00a0W with a 20-second interval. In the ozone\u00a0gas group, the operator applied a high dose of ozone (32\u00a0g/m<sup>3</sup>) for 30\u00a0seconds using a silicon cup. In the placebo group, no therapy was applied. The dentin sensitivity level was evaluated upon enrollment (T0), immediately after treatment (T1), 3\u00a0months post-treatment (T2), and 6\u00a0months post-treatment (T3) with a cold air blast challenge and tactile stimuli. The pain severity was quantified according to the visual analogue scale. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to scrutinize potential statistical disparities among the treatments. Statistical significance was predetermined at P\u00a0<\u00a0.05.", "A significant decrease of DHS was observed in the ozone gas\u00a0group and the `diode laser group immediately after treatment and after 3 and 6\u00a0months of the therapy. After 6 months from the therapy, the sensitivity values in the teeth treated with ozone gas\u00a0remained statistically lower than those treated with diode lasers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).", "A laser diode and ozone gas\u00a0are both efficient as dentin sensitivity treatment.
