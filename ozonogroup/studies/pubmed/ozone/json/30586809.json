High O<sub>3</sub> concentration events tend to occur frequently in north China, Yangtze, the Pearl River Delta, and the Sichuan Basin, among others. Studies on the meteorological contribution to O<sub>3</sub> in the troposphere have become a new direction for the scientific community. This research intends to explore how meteorological conditions contribute to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in all seasons on the basis of further studies of the PLAM index. Our findings are as follows. (1) In pollution-sensitive areas, following a height uplift in the pollution mixing layer (H_PML), NO<sub>2</sub> concentration decreases initially, followed by an explosive increase (EI) in O<sub>3</sub> concentration after sunrise. (2) This process varies significantly by season and area. (3) According to an analysis of the meteorological conditions causing rises in O<sub>3</sub> concentration within a few hours after sunrise, the initial decrease-subsequent increase in NO<sub>2</sub> versus O<sub>3</sub> concentration satisfies the law of exponent power rule, according to which seasonal and regional differences in coastal and inland areas depend on coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2. The explosive increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration, decrease in NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and characteristics of their diurnal cycles are also discussed. (4) Under the meteorological condition of static stability, below the static and stable cover, the H_PML of the polluted mixed layer consistently indicates the reciprocating cycle of day uplift and night pressure. The effect of air pump suction on the pollutant is an important mechanism of large-scale pollution in the study area under the condition of static and stable cover. (5) The influencing mechanism of meteorological conditions in the diurnal H_PML cycle aids in improving the understanding of O<sub>3</sub> concentration increases in the troposphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
