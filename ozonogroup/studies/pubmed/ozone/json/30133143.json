Here, we tested the hypothesis that chemodenitrification, the rapid reduction of nitric oxide by ferrous iron, would have enhanced the flux of N<sub>2</sub> O from ferruginous Proterozoic seas. We empirically derived a rate law, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow> <mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi> <mfenced><msub><mi>N</mi> <mn>2</mn></msub> <mi>O</mi></mfenced> </mrow> <mrow><mi>d</mi> <mi>t</mi></mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo> <mn>7.2</mn> <mo>\u00d7</mo> <msup><mn>10</mn> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>5</mn></mrow> </msup> <msup><mrow><mo>[</mo> <msup><mtext>Fe</mtext> <mrow><mn>2</mn> <mo>+</mo></mrow> </msup> <mo>]</mo></mrow> <mrow><mn>0.3</mn></mrow> </msup> <msup><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mtext>NO</mtext> <mo>]</mo></mrow> <mn>1</mn></msup> </mrow> </math> , and measured an isotopic site preference of +16\u2030 for the reaction. Using this empirical rate law, and integrating across an oceanwide oxycline, we found that low nM NO and \u03bcM-low mM Fe<sup>2+</sup> concentrations could have sustained a sea-air flux of 100-200 Tg N<sub>2</sub> O-N\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> , if N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates were near-modern and all fixed N<sub>2</sub> was emitted as N<sub>2</sub> O. A 1D photochemical model was used to obtain steady-state atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> O concentrations as a function of sea-air N<sub>2</sub> O flux across the wide range of possible pO<sub>2</sub> values (0.001-1 PAL). At 100-200 Tg N<sub>2</sub> O-N\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> and >0.1 PAL O<sub>2</sub> , this model yielded low-ppmv N<sub>2</sub> O, which would produce several degrees of greenhouse warming at 1.6\u00a0ppmv CH<sub>4</sub> and 320\u00a0ppmv CO<sub>2</sub> . These results suggest that enhanced N<sub>2</sub> O production in ferruginous seawater via a previously unconsidered chemodenitrification pathway may have helped to fill a Proterozoic \"greenhouse gap,\" reconciling an ice-free Mesoproterozoic Earth with a less luminous early Sun. A particularly notable result was that high N<sub>2</sub> O fluxes at intermediate O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (0.01-0.1 PAL) would have enhanced ozone screening of solar UV radiation. Due to rapid photolysis in the absence of an ozone shield, N<sub>2</sub> O is unlikely to have been an important greenhouse gas if Mesoproterozoic O<sub>2</sub> was 0.001 PAL. At low O<sub>2</sub> , N<sub>2</sub> O might have played a more important role as life's primary terminal electron acceptor during the transition from an anoxic to oxic surface Earth, and correspondingly, from anaerobic to aerobic metabolisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geosciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stanton", "ForeName": "Chloe L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reinhard", "ForeName": "Christopher T", "Initials": "CT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geosciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4042-2067"], "LastName": "Kasting", "ForeName": "James F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Institute, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ostrom", "ForeName": "Nathaniel E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haslun", "ForeName": "Joshua A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of California, Riverside, California."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lyons", "ForeName": "Timothy W", "Initials": "TW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0775-2486"], "LastName": "Glass", "ForeName": "Jennifer B", "Initials": "JB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NNA15BB03A", "Acronym": "NASA", "Agency": "NASA", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "NNX14AJ87G", "Acronym": "NASA", "Agency": "NASA", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "DE\u00a0FC02\u00a007ER64494", "Agency": "Biological and Environmental Research", "Country": "International"}, {"GrantID": "DE\u00a0SC0018409", "Agency": "Biological and Environmental Research", "Country": "International"}, {"GrantID": "EAR-1053432", "Agency": "Division of Earth Sciences", "Country": "International"}, {"Agency": "U.S. Department of Energy", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Geobiology", "NlmUniqueID": "101185472", "ISSNLinking": "1472-4669"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30133143", "10.1111/gbi.12311"]}}]}
