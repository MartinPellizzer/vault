Sham exposures to purified air alone served as controls. Exposure effects were assessed by pulmonary physiological tests and by a standardized clinical evaluation. No statistically physiological changes attributable to NO2 exposure were found except for a marginal loss in forced vital capacity after exposure on two successive days (1.5% mean decrease, P less than .05). Reported respiratory and other symptoms were slightly increased with exposure as compared to control, but the change was not significant. Short-term toxicity of NO2 at peak ambient concentrations appears to be substantially less than that of ozone in healthy people, but adverse NO2 effects in diseased people or in long-term exposures cannot be ruled out at present."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hackney", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thiede", "ForeName": "F C", "Initials": "FC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linn", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedersen", "ForeName": "E E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spier", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Law", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["686843", "10.1080/00039896.1978.10667330"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
