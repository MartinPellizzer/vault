In this work, polyethylene (PE), which is ubiquitous in the environment, was selected to study its removal by ozone-based treatment. Catalysts including \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> and \u03b1-FeOOH were synthesized for catalytic ozonation to improve efficiency. The study focused on simulating the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the off-gas via the detection of inorganic carbon produced. The morphology and structure of the remaining PE MPs were characterized using scanning electron microscope and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflection. Our results confirmed that fragmentation and oxidation occurred in the remaining PE MPs, which enhanced the adsorption capacity of ofloxacin (OF). Besides, the 20\u00a0mM \u03b1-FeOOH could better improve the mineralization efficiency by 3.27 folds with more production of \u2022OH (1.09*10<sup>-12</sup>\u00a0M). Moreover, possible products identified by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer confirmed the decomposition of main chains of MPs into low-molecular-weight organic compounds with functional groups such as C-OH, C-O-C, and CO. The finding that photoaged PE MPs could be efficiently mineralized under the attack of O<sub>3</sub>/\u2022OH provides a solid foundation for the removal of natural MPs in the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
