First, the influence of the active species inhibitors tertiary butanol alcohol (TBA), HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> on the degradation rate of pyridine was investigated to verify the existence of active species produced by the strong ionization discharge in the system. The intermediate and final products generated in the degradation process of pyridine were confirmed and analyzed through a series of analytical techniques, including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ion chromatography (IC), total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, etc. The results showed that the degradation of pyridine was mainly due to the strong oxidizing power of ozone and hydroxyl radical produced by the DBD system. Several intermediate products including 3-hydroxyl pyridine, fumaric acid, 2, 3-dihydroxypyridine, and oxalic acid were detected. Nitrogen was removed from the pyridine molecule to form nitrate. Through analysis of the degradation mechanism of pyridine, the oxidation pathway was deduced. The study provided a theoretical and experimental basis for the application of DBD strong ionization discharge in treatment of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds in drinking water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016.
