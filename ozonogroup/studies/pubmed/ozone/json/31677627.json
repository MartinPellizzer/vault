Data was collected from the medical records of 80 patients (56 women, 24 men ; average age : 45.8\u00b17.5). Corticosteroid injection was performed once a week for three times, and ozone was injected 6-8 times at 3 day intervals. No additional analgesics were given. Pain assessment was made by means of Verhaar scores before and after the first injection, on 3rd, 6th and 9th months. The duration of pain was 24.4\u00b112.5 months and the right side was more commonly affected (47, 58.8% vs. 33, 41.2%). Corticosteroid and ozone groups were similar with respect to age (p=0.45), gender distribution (p=0.43) and side of epicondylitis (p=0.88). Pain scores at rest, at compression and on activity were not different in two groups before and following injection. Notably, ozone group displayed better scores compared to corticosteroid in terms of pain on 3rd, 6th and 9th months after injection (p<0.001 for all). Our results demonstrated that ozone injection can be an effective therapeutic option for CLE patients who are refractory to conservative treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ulusoy", "ForeName": "G\u00f6khan Ragip", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bilge", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk", "ForeName": "\u00d6m\u00fcr", "Initials": "\u00d6"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Belgium", "MedlineTA": "Acta Orthop Belg", "NlmUniqueID": "2985165R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6462"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenal Cortex Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "826Y60901U", "NameOfSubstance": "betamethasone-17,21-dipropionate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9842X06Q6M", "NameOfSubstance": "Betamethasone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Cortex Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Betamethasone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Administration Schedule"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intra-Articular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Management"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Tennis Elbow"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31677627"]}}]}
