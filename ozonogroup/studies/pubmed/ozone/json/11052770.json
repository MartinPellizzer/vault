All-trans beta-carotene, 9-cis beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene were adsorbed onto a C(18) solid phase and exposed to a continuous flow of water saturated with oxygen or ozone at 30 degrees C. Carotenoids were analyzed using HPLC with a C(30) column and a photodiode array detector. Approximately 90% of all-trans beta-carotene, 9-cis beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin were lost after exposure to ozone for 7 h. A similar loss of lycopene occurred in only 1 h. When exposed to oxygen, all carotenoids, except beta-cryptoxanthin, degraded at lower rates. The degradation of all the carotenoids followed zero-order reaction kinetics with the following relative rates: lycopene > beta-cryptoxanthin > all-trans beta-carotene > 9-cis beta-carotene. The major degradation products of beta-carotene were tentatively identified on the basis of their elution on the HPLC column, UV-Vis spectra, and electrospray LC-MS. Predominant isomers of beta-carotene were 13-cis, 9-cis, and a di-cis isomer. Products resulting from cleavage of the molecule were beta-apo-13-carotenone and beta-apo-14'-carotenal, whereas epoxidation yielded beta-carotene 5,8-epoxide and beta-carotene 5, 8-endoperoxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Post Office Box 7624, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7624, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henry", "ForeName": "L K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puspitasari-Nienaber", "ForeName": "N L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jar\u00e9n-Gal\u00e1n", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Breemen", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Catignani", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11052770", "10.1021/jf000503o", "jf000503o"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
