Pollution effects were investigated with delays (lags) of 1-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24, and 25-72 hours in both single and multi-pollutant models, adjusted for ambient temperature, relative humidity, circulating levels of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, day of week, holidays, and residual seasonality within calendar month strata.", "Population based study in 15 conurbations in England and Wales.", "79,288 diagnoses of myocardial infarction recorded over the period 2003-6.", "Excess risk of myocardial infarction per 10 \u00b5g/m(3) increase in pollutant level.", "In single pollutant models, PM(10) and NO(2) levels were associated with a very short term increase in risk of myocardial infarction 1-6 hours later (excess risks 1.2% (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.1) and 1.1% (0.3 to 1.8) respectively per 10 \u03bcg/m(3) increase); the effects persisted in multi-pollutant models, though with only weak evidence of an independent PM(10) effect (P = 0.05). The immediate risk increases were followed by reductions in risk at longer lags: we found no evidence of any net excess risk associated with the five pollutants studied over a 72 hour period after exposure.", "Higher levels of PM(10) and NO(2), which are typically markers of traffic related pollution, seem to be associated with transiently increased risk of myocardial infarction 1-6 hours after exposure, but later reductions in risk suggest that air pollution may be associated with bringing events forward in time (\"short-term displacement\") rather than increasing overall risk. The well established effect of air pollution on cardiorespiratory mortality may not be mediated through increasing the acute risk of myocardial infarction, but through another mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. krishnan.bhaskaran@lshtm.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhaskaran", "ForeName": "Krishnan", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hajat", "ForeName": "Shakoor", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Armstrong", "ForeName": "Ben", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haines", "ForeName": "Andy", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herrett", "ForeName": "Emily", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkinson", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smeeth", "ForeName": "Liam", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "076583/Z/05/Z", "Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"Agency": "British Heart Foundation", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "BMJ", "NlmUniqueID": "8900488", "ISSNLinking": "0959-8138"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "BMJ. 2011 Sep 20;343:d5814. doi: 10.1136/bmj.d5814", "PMID": "21933825"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wales"}], "CoiStatement": "Competing interests: All authors have completed the unified competing interest form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: KB, EH, and LS had support for the submitted work from the British Heart Foundation, the Garfield Weston Trust, and the Wellcome Trust respectively; no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Dockery DW, Pope CA 3rd, Xu X, Spengler JD, Ware JH, Fay ME, et al.
