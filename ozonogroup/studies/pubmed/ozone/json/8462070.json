Ozone treatment induced damages and necrotic phenomena of ciliated cells, as well as a significant increase in the population density of small mucous granule (SMG) cells compared to controls. In addition, the appearance of 'intermediate' cells, a type of nonciliated cells which was not observed in controls, was noticed. Characterization of the secretory cell carbohydrates with the PA-TCH-SP, HID-TCH-SP and LID-TCH-SP sequences indicated the existence of periodate-reactive sulfated and carboxylated polysaccharides in both treated and control monkeys. The luminal surface of the affected tracheal cells, however, exhibited a glycocalyx more rich in mucosubstances than the control animals. The possible role of 'intermediate' and SMG cells in repairing the injured epithelial regions, as well as the significance of the ozone concentrations used in relation to the ozone range measured in photochemical smog are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, School of Biology, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dimitriadis", "ForeName": "V K", "Initials": "VK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Submicrosc Cytol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8804312", "ISSNLinking": "1122-9497"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosaminoglycans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosaminoglycans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8462070"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
