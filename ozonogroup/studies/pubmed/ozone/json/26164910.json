The effect of the percentage of Fe dopping mass, catalyst dosage and the natural concentration of substrate on m-cresol conversion and TOC removal were studied. The structural property of Fe-MCM-41 was characterized by X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, M\u00f6ssbauer spectra and BET of catalysts. The results showed that Fe dopping mass had a great effect on the catalytic activity of Fe-MCM-41 in catalytic ozonation and the optimal percentage of dopping mass was 4.4% (wt). The results showed that with Fe dopping mass increase, the degree of crystallinity became weaker, the crystal surface distance reduced, as well as the specific surface area, pore volume and aperture. \u03b3-Fe2O3 was the only form staying on the surface of MCM-41, and the catalyst had good ferromagnetism and stability. Ozonation played a role of both direct oxidation and indirect oxidation in the reaction, approximately the same ratio. Under the experimental condition of the natural pH of model wastewater,using 4.4% (wt) Fe-MCM-41 as catalyst, natural concentration of m-cresol 500 mg x L(-1), catalyst dosage 0.1 g x L(-1) and reaction time 30 min, m-cresol conversion and TOC removal were 100% and 26.8%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wen-jing", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ya-min", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Huang-zhao", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xu-ning", "Initials": "XN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing-mei", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Cheng-lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Lu-yang", "Initials": "LY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cresols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MCM-41"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1MXY2UM8NV", "NameOfSubstance": "4-cresol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cresols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26164910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
