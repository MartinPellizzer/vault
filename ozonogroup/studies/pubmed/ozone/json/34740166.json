To improve predictions of the efficiency of oxidation processes and the formation of oxidation products, methods to determine concentrations of oxidant-reactive phenolic, olefinic or amine-type DOM moieties are critical. Here, a novel selective oxidative titration approach is presented, which is based on reaction kinetics of oxidation reactions towards certain DOM moieties. Phenolic moieties were determined by oxidative titration with ClO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> for five DOM isolates and two secondary wastewater effluent samples. The determined concentrations of phenolic moieties correlated with the electron-donating capacity (EDC) and the formation of inorganic ClO<sub>2</sub>-byproducts (HOCl, ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). ClO<sub>2</sub>-byproduct yields from phenol and DOM isolates and changes due to the application of molecular tagging for phenols revealed a better understanding of oxidant-reactive structures within DOM. Overall, oxidative titrations with ClO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> provide a novel and promising tool to quantify oxidant-reactive moieties in complex mixtures such as DOM and can be expanded to other matrices or oxidants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
