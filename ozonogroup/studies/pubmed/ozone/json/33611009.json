Hourly data on air pollutants and daily information on meteorological factors were obtained. According to the World Health Organization air-quality guidelines, daily excessive concentration hours (DECH) was calculated. PM<sub>2.5</sub> daily mean, hourly-peak concentration and DECH were used as the exposure variables. Based on a case-time-control design, the Cox regression model was applied to evaluate the short-term relative risks (RR) of daily OCV for hypertension. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, with nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone being adjusted.", "Daily mean and hourly-peak of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were significantly associated with daily OCV for hypertension, while weaker associations were observed for DECH. The estimated RRs at lag day 0 were 1.039 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.037, 1.040), 1.851 (95%CI: 1.814, 1.888), and 1.287 (95%CI: 1.276, 1.298), respectively, in association with a 1-unit increase in DECH, daily mean, and hourly-peak concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. For the lagged effect, lag<sub>4</sub> models estimated the greatest RRs for PM<sub>2.5</sub> DECH and hourly-peak, whereas a lag<sub>2</sub> model produced the highest for PM<sub>2.5</sub> daily mean.", "This study consolidates the evidence for a positive correlation between ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and risks of hypertensive OCV. It also provides profound insight regarding planning for health services needs and establishing early environmental responses to the worsening air pollution in the communities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
