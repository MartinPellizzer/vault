In the first example, by ozonolysis a seven-component mixture consisting of cis,cis 5,12-, 6,10-, 6,11-, 6,12-, 7,12-, 8,12-, and 9,12-octadecadienoates was converted to aldehydes, aldehyde-esters and dialdehydes. These fragments were separated on a 50 m X 0.2 mm free fatty acid phase (FFAP) vitreous silica capillary column. Equations for an arbitrarily restricted 12 X 15 matrix of linear simultaneous equations and a computer solution of the matrix provided the composition of the initial methyl octadecadienoate mixture. The power and significance of this method became apparent with the observation that only two of the seven isomers in the known mixture were resolved as single peaks by state-of-the-art capillary gas chromatography, but all seven were identified and estimated with acceptable error by the ozonolysis-capillary gas chromatography-computer procedure. In a generalized approach to the analysis of the 55 possible nonconjugated isomers, a computer program selects the appropriate matrix of linear simultaneous equations based on the aldehyde data supplied by the analyst. Twenty of 21 combinations of seven isomeric esters taken five at a time have been analyzed to assess the efficiency of the method. To illustrate applicability at this stage of development, the method has been used to analyze the diene products of the hydrazine reduction of gamma-linolenic acid and the diene products from the biological desaturation of isomeric monoenes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin 55912."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dutton", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pusch", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lie Ken Jie", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gunstone", "ForeName": "F D", "Initials": "FD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holman", "ForeName": "R T", "Initials": "RT"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL 08214", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL 21513", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P0-AM 34931", "Acronym": "AM", "Agency": "NIADDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lipids", "NlmUniqueID": "0060450", "ISSNLinking": "0024-4201"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "26764-25-0", "NameOfSubstance": "octadecadienoic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematical Computing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Am Oil Chem Soc. 1965 Jun;42:511-6", "ArticleIdList": ["14300207"]}, {"Citation": "Prog Lipid Res. 1981;20:151-6", "ArticleIdList": ["7342080"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Apr 18;618(1):1-12", "ArticleIdList": ["7378423"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3412129", "10.1007/BF02535524"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
