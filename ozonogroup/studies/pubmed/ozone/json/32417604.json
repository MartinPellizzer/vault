The room temperature-active bimetallic oxide catalysts were prepared by the addition of Fe, Cu, Ru, and Ag precursors to Mn/HZSM-5. We obtained H<sub>2</sub>-temperature-programmed reduction (H<sub>2</sub>-TPR) profiles, X-ray diffraction patterns, and X-ray photoelectron spectra to investigate the characteristics of the prepared catalysts. The catalytic efficiency of Mn-based bimetallic oxide catalysts in degrading toluene and ozone at room temperature was mostly improved by the addition of the secondary metals. The prepared bimetallic oxide catalysts, Cu-Mn/HZSM-5, Fe-Mn/HZSM-5, Ru-Mn/HZSM-5, and Ag-Mn/HZSM-5, enhanced efficiency for toluene removal compared to Mn/HZSM-5. The H<sub>2</sub>-TPR profiles of the Mn-based bimetallic oxide catalysts showed stronger and broader adsorption-desorption bands at lower temperatures than the profile of Mn/HZSM-5. Additionally, the ratio of the surface defective oxygen over the lattice oxygen on the bimetallic oxide catalysts was higher than that of Mn-only catalysts; the ratio of Mn<sup>3+</sup> over Mn<sup>4+</sup> was higher for all bimetallic oxide catalysts, as well. Among the bimetallic oxide catalysts, Ru-Mn/HZSM-5 showed the highest efficiency for the removal of toluene to CO<sub>x</sub> due to the synergetic effect of the oxidation state and reducible potential at room temperature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
