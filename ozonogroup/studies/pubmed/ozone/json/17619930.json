To assess such a possibility, the three major phenolics of two epiphytic lichen species with contrasting tolerance to chronic air pollution from Mexico City were studied by combining experimental reactivity data and measured field contents. The antioxidant activity and antiradical power of boninic (BO), 2-O-methylsekikaic (MA), and usnic (US) acids, isolated from the tolerant Ramalina asahinae and salazinic acid (SA), atranorin (AT), and chloroatranorin (CA), from the sensitive Parmotrema stuppeum, were determined in vitro by kinetic experiments with ozone and the free radical diphenyl picryl hidrazyl (DPPH*), respectively. In addition, the field contents of these phenolics in the lichens, and the potential antioxidant capacity (PAC) they provide, were compared among three forested sites exposed to urban emissions and a similar, relatively clean site. The six phenolics had antioxidant activity and antiradical power according to these trends: CA >> AT > US > SA > or = BO > or = MA for O(3); and CA > AT > US > MA > SA = BO for DPPH*. The three most reactive phenolics are cortical compounds, located in the lichen portion most exposed to the surrounding environment. In contrast, the less reactive SA, BO, and MA are medullary. Such reactivity patterns indicate that some phenolics may provide antioxidative protection at the air-lichen interface. The higher antioxidant power of CA and AT may be due to the reactive hydroxyl groups at positions 2 and 4 of ring A, instead of the less reactive methoxyl at the same positions in both BO and MA. In the field comparisons, total quantified phenolics were significantly higher near Mexico City for both lichens, except for the tolerant R. asahinae at one site. Nevertheless, only the latter species had significantly increased PAC values at all sites near the city. This result is explained by species-dependent changes in individual phenolics. At the polluted sites, R. asahinae had consistently higher contents of its most reactive phenolic, US, with values approximately twice that of the control site. In contrast, P. stuppeum only increased its less reactive SA (26-35%), but this was counteracted by CA and, to a lesser extent, AT degradation. Thus, the substantial increase in US at the polluted sites appears to be associated with the current ecological success of R. asahinae near the city. On the other hand, the inability of P. stuppeum to overcome degradation of its most reactive phenolic (CA) at the same sites seems to partially explain the declining status of this lichen. These results provide evidence for a protective mechanism in lichens against air pollution based on secondary metabolites, which may eventually determine which species survive in forests stressed by oxidative air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Mexicano del Petr\u00f3leo, Eje Central L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas 152, San Bartolo Atepehuacan, M\u00e9xico, DF 07730, M\u00e9xico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valencia-Islas", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zambrano", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rojas", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "7505563", "ISSNLinking": "0098-0331"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lichens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2004 Feb 25;52(4):912-5", "ArticleIdList": ["14969550"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2001 Jul;56(1-2):9-16", "ArticleIdList": ["11499952"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2002 Mar;79(3):325-9", "ArticleIdList": ["11849836"]}, {"Citation": "Z Naturforsch C. 2000 Nov-Dec;55(11-12):1018-22", "ArticleIdList": ["11204179"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1995 Aug 18;269(5226):953-6", "ArticleIdList": ["17807730"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2005 Oct 15;39(20):8014-22", "ArticleIdList": ["16295869"]}, {"Citation": "Phytother Res. 2004 Nov;18(11):938-41", "ArticleIdList": ["15597312"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Feb 22;102(8):3141-6", "ArticleIdList": ["15710882"]}, {"Citation": "J Inorg Biochem. 2002 Jul 25;91(1):139-50", "ArticleIdList": ["12121771"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 2003 Sep;29(9):2049-71", "ArticleIdList": ["14584675"]}, {"Citation": "Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1995 Nov;39(11):2541-3", "ArticleIdList": ["8585741"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Toxicol Chem. 2002 Nov;21(11):2468-76", "ArticleIdList": ["12389928"]}, {"Citation": "Biotechnol Lett. 2005 Jul;27(14):991-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16132842"]}, {"Citation": "Phytochemistry. 1994 Dec;37(6):1585-7", "ArticleIdList": ["7765999"]}, {"Citation": "Farmaco. 2001 May-Jul;56(5-7):379-82", "ArticleIdList": ["11482762"]}, {"Citation": "Faraday Discuss. 2005;130:227-39; discussion 241-64, 519-24", "ArticleIdList": ["16161787"]}, {"Citation": "Food Chem Toxicol. 2003 Jun;41(6):753-8", "ArticleIdList": ["12738180"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Pharm Sci. 1998 Apr;6(2):141-4", "ArticleIdList": ["9795033"]}, {"Citation": "Altern Lab Anim. 2004 Dec;32(6):605-15", "ArticleIdList": ["15757498"]}, {"Citation": "Naturwissenschaften. 2002 Apr;89(4):137-46", "ArticleIdList": ["12061397"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1995;88(3):345-54", "ArticleIdList": ["15091548"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17619930", "10.1007/s10886-007-9330-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
