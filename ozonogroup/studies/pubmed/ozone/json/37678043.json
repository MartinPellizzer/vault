Long-term ultraviolet (UV) rays exposure will lead to skin tanning, even skin cancer in severe cases, and generate free radicals to cause skin aging. To better protect human skin against UV rays, this work explores the absorption capacities and antioxidant activities of four stilbene derivatives (EHDB, EDMB, EAPD, and HPTP) through the computational chemistry method and DPPH radical scavenging experiment. The research results indicate that their absorption spectra cover the entire UV region, and can effectively protect against UVB radiation. Moreover, three prevailing antioxidant mechanisms: hydrogen atom transfer, sequential proton loss electron transfer, and single electron transfer followed by proton transfer mechanisms, were used to evaluate their antioxidant activities in the ground state. It can be concluded that the O<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1</sub> sites of EHDB and HPTP are the most active, and the SPLET mechanism is the most preferred for the four compounds in ethanol solvent. Furthermore, the DPPH radical scavenging experiment compensates for the theoretical calculation deficiency in the excited state, revealing that the EHDB and HPTP are the most suitable for sunscreen due to their excellent performance on antioxidant capacities, whether before or after sunlight. This work will facilitate EHDB and HPTP to be applied in sunscreen and provide a novel idea in sunscreen research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
