There are no special technologies designed to directly remove ARGs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In order to reduce the risk of ARGs, it is vital to understand the efficiency of advanced treatment technologies in removing antibiotic resistance genes in WWTPs. This review highlights the application and efficiency of tertiary treatment technologies on the elimination of ARGs, s, based on an understanding of their occurrence and fate in WWTPs. These technologies include chemical-based processes such as chlorination, ozonation, ultraviolet, and advanced oxidation technology, as well as physical separation processes, biological processes such as constructed wetland and membrane bioreactor, and soil aquifer treatment. The merits, limitations and ameliorative measures of these processes are discussed, with the view to optimizing future treatment strategies and identifying new research directions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
