With this, photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation are strong solutions to obtain good quality reclaimed water, for different applications. Nanostructured supported photo-active catalysts, such as the TiO<sub>2</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub> or ZnO can positively affect the performance of such technologies. Therefore, different semiconductors materials have been aroused the interest of the scientific community, mainly due to its functional properties as well as characteristics imposed by the different nanostructures. With this, this work overviews different works and perspective on the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes and other semiconductors nanostructures, with the analysis of different works from 2001 to 2022. Aspects as the substrate effect, electrolyte nature, aspect ratio, electrolyte aging, and annealing treatment but also the effect of morphology, anodization time, applied voltage, temperature and viscosity are discussed. Modification of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes is also presented in this paper. The main objective of this work is to present and discuss the key parameters and their effects on the anodization of different semiconductors, as well as the results obtained until today on the degradation of different contaminants by photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation, as well as their use on the treatment of real wastewater. TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes present unique properties and highly ordered configuration, which motivate their use on photo-driven technologies for the pollutant's abatement, even when compared to other nanostructures. However, photocatalysts with activity on the visible range and solar radiation, such as the WO<sub>3</sub>, can present higher performance and can decrease operational costs, and must be an important source and a key to find efficient and cost-friendly solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
