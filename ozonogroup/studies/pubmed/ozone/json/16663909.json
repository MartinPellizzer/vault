One factor which likely influences or can be influenced by these changes is the energy state of the cell. To study this relationship, various indicators of cell energy status were examined in the presence and absence of O(3).The active uptake of chloride and deoxyglucose is nearly completely inhibited by O(3) at a dose at which cellular death, measured by plating efficiency, is minimal. Glucose-stimulated respiration, dependent upon ATP/ADP balance, is depressed to a greater degree than endogenous respiration in ozonated cells. Total ATP and glucose-6-phosphate levels also decrease but not as rapidly, and labeled intermediates of glucose metabolism are lost.Thus, exposure to O(3) results in a depletion of the cell's energy reserves as substantiated by changes observed in processes which both utilize and generate ATP. This loss in energy reserves occurs at the same exposure level of O(3) as do the changes in passive transport properties. Thus, we cannot tell which occurs first; and the processes seem to be linked with respect to O(3) injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California, Riverside, California 92521."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heath", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1973 Jan;51(1):48-56", "ArticleIdList": ["16658295"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1975 Jan;55(1):15-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16659020"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1973 Feb;51(2):378-81", "ArticleIdList": ["16658333"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Jan;69(1):229-33", "ArticleIdList": ["16662164"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1975 Dec;56(6):723-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16659380"]}, {"Citation": "FEBS Lett. 1978 Mar 1;87(1):157-60", "ArticleIdList": ["24552"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 Sep;64(3):455-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16660987"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1968 Jun 11;150(4):618-25", "ArticleIdList": ["5660369"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Biochem. 1976 Nov 1;70(1):197-204", "ArticleIdList": ["12943"]}, {"Citation": "J Membr Biol. 1973;14(4):305-38", "ArticleIdList": ["4360924"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1978 May;61(5):785-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16660385"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 Aug;64(2):224-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16660937"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16663909", "PMC1064358", "10.1104/pp.76.3.700"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
