Antioxidant levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue homogenates.", "Malondialdehyde concentrations in lung tissue homogenates were significantly increased in the group exposed to 2-ppm ozone compared to the filtered air group. Uric acid and gamma-tocopherol concentrations in BAL fluid were significantly increased in the ozone exposure group compared to the filtered air group (p < 0.01). Uric acid concentrations were increased in a concentration-dependent manner according to ozone concentration to which the animals were exposed. Increases in Penh after ozone exposure were significantly higher in an ozone concentration-dependent manner. The proportion of neutrophils in BAL fluid was significantly higher in the group exposed to 2 ppm than in the filtered air and the group exposed to 0.12 ppm (p < 0.01, respectively). The level of ascorbate correlated with the level of gamma-tocopherol.", "These findings suggest that antioxidant responses may serve as a protective mechanism against a range of oxidants in BALB/c mice exposed to ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2005 S.
