Ambient annual concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> for the residential community were estimated using satellite data and chemical transport model. A mixed effects model was utilized to assess the effects of ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on presbyopia, as well as their combined effects.", "A total of 13,841 presbyopia cases were identified among the participants with a prevalence rate of 41.17%. For both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, we found a J-shaped exposure-response relationship with the threshold being identified at 15\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 55\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for O<sub>3</sub>. The odds ratio (OR) of presbyopia was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.21) for each 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> above 15\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.54) for O<sub>3</sub> above 55\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> after adjusting for various potential confounding factors. There appeared to be a synergistic interaction between ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on presbyopia in the additive model, the combined effect was significantly larger than the sum of their individual effects, with a synergistic index of 2.39.", "This study supports that exposures to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> might be important risk factors of presbyopia among old adults, and simultaneously exposure to high level of the two pollutants could intensify their individual effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
