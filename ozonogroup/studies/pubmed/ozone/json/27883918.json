Results indicated that pH depression, as a commonly feasible control strategy for bromate formation during ozonation, unexpectedly enhanced the bromate formation during ozonation in the presence of HA. A dramatically high level of bromate was observed at acidic pH in the ozone/HA process. The scavenging experiments demonstrated the essential role of OH produced in the reaction of ozone with HA in bromate formation. In the process, OH mainly oxidizes bromide to Br, which is further oxidized by ozone and eventually converts to bromate. Further investigations suggested that the unexpected enhancement on bromate formation by pH depression can be mainly ascribed to the pH-dependent ozone decay, OH exposures and formation rate of Br. As pH decreased from 7 to 5, the reduced OH scavenging capacity of HA led to higher OH exposures, which contributed to the enhancement of bromate formation. As pH decreased from 5 to 3, the enhanced formation rate of Br largely augmented the formation of bromate. In addition, the ozone decay slowed down by pH depression provided more available ozone for the oxidation of the formed Br to bromate. The enhanced effect of pH depression on bromate formation was still observed in the real water samples in the ozone/HA process. Accordingly, pH depression might be avoided to control the bromate formation during ozonation in the presence of HA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
