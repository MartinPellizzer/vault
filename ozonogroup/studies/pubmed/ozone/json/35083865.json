However, the safety of these liquids has not been extensively studied. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the risks of ozonated liquids to human skin tissue based on the available literature. We completed a structured search of five scientific databases and identified 378 articles for consideration. Based on pre-established inclusion/exclusion criteria, nine studies were included in this review. Two studies specifically evaluated the cytotoxicity of ozonated liquids on human cells, five studies evaluated ozonated liquids in randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one was a post-market surveillance study, and one was a crossover study in humans. None of the included studies found any significant human dermatologic risks associated with ozonated water or liquid. Because of the small sample size, however, additional short- and long-term RCTs specifically designed to evaluate the dermatological risks of ozonated liquids are recommended."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Authors.
