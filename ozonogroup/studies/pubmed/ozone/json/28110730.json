This study estimates the effect of different PM sizes on the incidence of CVD in Taipei, Taiwan.", "We collected outpatients with CVD from 2006 to 2010 and data on the concentrations of air pollutants such as PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. A Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) was used to explore the effect of different PM sizes on CVD risk.", "In high air pollution events, PM<sub>2.5</sub> was significantly associated with elevated risk (4.9%) [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.010-1.089] for CVD with increasing interquartile range (IQR) in single air pollutant model. PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> did not show a significant positive association with CVD in this study. After adjusting for other air pollutants such as SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>, the estimated effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> only decreased 0.2%.
