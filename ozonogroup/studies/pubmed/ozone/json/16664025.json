Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from control and ozone-treated (0.2 to 0.5 microliters per liter ozone for 5 hours) leaf tissue, and the (K(+) + Mg(2+))-ATPase activity determined and compared. No major changes were observed in the resistant varieties. The sensitive variety showed a severe inhibition of ATPase activity which was largely due to a decrease in the K(+)-stimulated component. This inhibition was completely reversed by the addition of sulfhydryl compounds.Ozone-induced plasma membrane permeability changes may be effected by damage to membrane proteins, perhaps by oxidation of amino acid sulfhydryl groups to disulfide and sulfenic moieties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California, Riverside, California 92521."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dominy", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heath", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Sep;68(3):521-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16661950"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1977 Dec;83(2):346-56", "ArticleIdList": ["603028"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Nov;70(5):1335-40", "ArticleIdList": ["16662676"]}, {"Citation": "Atmos Environ. 1969 Nov;3(6):669-82", "ArticleIdList": ["5382204"]}, {"Citation": "Methods Enzymol. 1974;32:392-406", "ArticleIdList": ["4155469"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 Sep;64(3):455-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16660987"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16664025", "PMC1064453", "10.1104/pp.77.1.43"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
