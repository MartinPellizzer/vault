Surprisingly, in recent years, PAN have also been detected under conditions that do not favor the photochemical processes. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms of formation of atmospheric compound pollution, this study examined the relationships between concentrations of PAN and other pollutants (e.g., ozone [O<sub>3</sub>] and PM<sub>2.5</sub>) during a winter haze episode. The observation periods were from December 31, 2015, to February 2, 2016, and from February 19, 2016, to March 4, 2016. The maximum daily concentration of PAN during haze episodes was 4-10 times higher than that during non-haze episodes. The continuous cumulative increase in PAN concentrations was the result of a combination of photochemical production during the daytime and production based on free radical chemical reactions during the nighttime. During the haze episode, the correlation between concentrations of PAN and O<sub>3</sub> was weak, while a significant correlation was observed between PAN and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.82). This may have been due to higher concentrations of particulate matter impairing illumination, which can then inhibit the photochemical reactions that produce PAN and O<sub>3</sub>. OH radicals can replace the role of light in PAN formation, which can cause concentrations of PAN and O<sub>3</sub> to vary independently. During the haze episode, the ratio of PAN/O<sub>3</sub> was around 0.3, which was much higher than that during the clean period."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
