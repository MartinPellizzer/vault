Airway responsiveness was assessed by determining the provocative concentration of ACh and AA aerosols that increased respiratory resistance (Rrs) to twice the base-line value. O3 (3 parts per million) increased airway responsiveness to ACh in dogs both sensitive and insensitive to AA, and it significantly decreased the ACh provocation concentration from 0.541 +/- 0.095 to 0.102 +/- 0.047 (SE) mg/ml (P less than 0.01; n = 10). AA aerosols, even at the highest concentration in combination with O3, did not increase Rrs in dogs insensitive to AA. However, O3 increased airway responsiveness to AA in AA-sensitive dogs and significantly decreased log AA provocation concentration from 2.34 +/- 0.22 to 0.50 +/- 0.17 (SE) log protein nitrogen units/ml (P less than 0.01; n = 7). O3-induced hyperresponsiveness to ACh returned to the base-line level within 2 wk, but hyperresponsiveness to AA continued for greater than 2 wk. The plasma histamine concentration after AA challenge was significantly higher after than before O3 (P less than 0.01). Intravenous infusion of OKY-046 (100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), an inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis, inhibited the O3-induced increase in responsiveness to ACh, but it had no effects on the O3-induced increase in responsiveness to AA and the increase in the plasma histamine concentration. These results suggest that O3 increases susceptibility to the antigen in sensitized dogs via a different mechanism from that of O3-induced muscarinic hyperresponsiveness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yanai", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohrui", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aikawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okayama", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sekizawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeyama", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takishima", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Helminth"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacrylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.99.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane-A Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L256JB984D", "NameOfSubstance": "ozagrel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Helminth"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascaris"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methacrylates"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane-A Synthase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2384406", "10.1152/jappl.1990.68.6.2267"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
