The concentrations of each pharmaceutical compound were determined in raw sewage, effluent and sewage sludge samples by LC-MS/MS analysis. The occurrence of antidepressant by-products formed in treated effluent after ozonation was also investigated.", "Current primary treatments using physical and chemical processes removed little of the compounds (mean removal efficiency: 19%). Experimental sorption coefficients (Kd) of each studied compounds were also calculated. Sorption of venlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine, and carbamazepine on sludge was assumed to be negligible (log Kd \u2264 2), but higher sorption behavior can be expected for sertraline (log Kd \u2265 4). Ozonation treatment with O3 (5 mg/L) led to a satisfactory mean removal efficiency of 88% of the compounds. Screening of the final ozone-treated effluent samples by high resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-QqToFMS) did confirm the presence of related N-oxide by-products.", "Effluent ozonation led to higher mean removal efficiencies than current primary treatment, and therefore represented a promising strategy for the elimination of antidepressants in urban wastewaters. However, the use of O3 produced by-products with unknown toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Canada, Wastewater and Effluents Section, Water Science and Technology Directorate, 105 McGill Street, Montreal, Quebec, H2Y 2E7, Canada. christian.gagnon@ec.gc.ca."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lajeunesse", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blais", "ForeName": "Mireille", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barbeau", "ForeName": "Beno\u00eet", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sauv\u00e9", "ForeName": "S\u00e9bastien", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gagnon", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Cent J", "NlmUniqueID": "101314213", "ISSNLinking": "1752-153X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Halling-S\u00f8rensen B, Nors Nielsen S, Lanzky PF, Ingerslev F, Holten L\u00fctzh\u00f8ft HC, J\u00f8rgensen SE.
