Model resolution is an important factor affecting the accuracy of exposure assessment using model predictions. In this study, the WRF/CMAQ model system was applied to quantitatively estimate the impacts of the model resolution on the predictions of air quality and associated health exposure in Nanjing, China in 2016. Air quality was simulated with a grid resolution of 1, 4, 12, and 36\u00a0km respectively. Predictions with 1 or 4\u00a0km resolution are slightly better for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and its compositions and predictions with 12\u00a0km are slightly better for daily 8-h maximum ozone (O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h). Model resolution does not significantly improve predictions for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h in Nanjing, however, the spatial distributions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h are better captured with finer resolutions. Population weighted concentrations (PWCs) of PM<sub>2.5</sub> with different model resolutions are similar to the average of observations, but PWCs of O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h with all resolutions are obviously larger than the observations, indicating that the current sites may well represent the population exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, but under-estimate the exposure to O<sub>3</sub>. Model resolution results in about 6% in the estimated premature mortality due to exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> but more than 20% difference in premature mortality due to exposure to O<sub>3</sub>. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impacts of the resolution on the exposure of PM<sub>2.5</sub> compositions in the city scale when PM<sub>2.5</sub> composition measurements available at multiple sites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
