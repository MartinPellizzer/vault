Although growing evidence suggests respiratory exacerbations from elevated fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) during wildfires, significantly less is known about the impacts on human health of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) that may also be increased due to wildfires. Using machine learning, we created daily surface concentration maps for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> during an intense wildfire in California in 2008. We then linked these daily exposures to counts of respiratory hospitalizations and emergency department visits at the ZIP code level. We calculated relative risks of respiratory health outcomes using Poisson generalized estimating equations models for each exposure in separate and mutually-adjusted models, additionally adjusted for pertinent covariates. During the active fire periods, PM<sub>2.5</sub> was significantly associated with exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and these effects remained after controlling for O<sub>3</sub>. Effect estimates of O<sub>3</sub> during the fire period were non-significant for respiratory hospitalizations but were significant for ED visits for asthma (RR\u202f=\u202f1.05 and 95% CI\u202f=\u202f(1.022, 1.078) for a 10\u202fppb increase in O<sub>3</sub>). In mutually-adjusted models, the significant findings for PM<sub>2.5</sub> remained whereas the associations with O<sub>3</sub> were confounded. Adjusted for O<sub>3</sub>, the RR for asthma ED visits associated with a 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 1.112 and 95% CI\u202f=\u202f(1.087, 1.138). The significant findings for PM<sub>2.5</sub> but not for O<sub>3</sub> in mutually-adjusted models is likely due to the fact that PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels during these fires exceeded the 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 35\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for 4976 ZIP-code days and reached levels up to 6.073 times the NAAQS, whereas our estimated O<sub>3</sub> levels during the fire period only occasionally exceeded the NAAQS of 70\u202fppb with low exceedance levels. Future studies should continue to investigate the combined role of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> during wildfires to get a more comprehensive assessment of the cumulative burden on health from wildfire smoke."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
