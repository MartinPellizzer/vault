The findings revealed that MNB ozonation achieved efficient OTC oxidation (>99\u00a0% in 60\u00a0min), and significantly enhanced methane production by 51\u00a0% compared to conventional ozonation (under 30\u00a0min of pretreatment). Additionally, MNB ozonation resulted in a decrease in the soluble chemical oxygen demand and reduced volatile fatty acid accumulation compared to conventional ozonation. Furthermore, the study sheds light on the profound impact of OTC and its oxidation by-products on the sludge microbiome. Exposure to OTC and its oxidation by-products resulted in alterations in extracellular polymeric substances composition and led to significant shifts in microbial community structure. This study highlights the promise of MNB ozonation as an effective approach for pharmaceutical pollutant removal and the optimization of AD performance in wastewater treatment, with implications for improved environmental sustainability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
