Two separate processes have been compared for the removal of flue gases, that is, Ozone/UV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV. The research aims to develop a comparative study for the removal of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> simultaneously using Ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV light and find the energy consumption (also known as <i>E</i><sub>EO</sub>) for each process. Combining UV with O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> play a crucial role in generating hydroxyl radicals. Different combinations of Ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, flue gas, and UV intensity were studied at different pH and temperatures of the solution to achieve maximum removal of the flue gases. For, the ozonation process it was observed that the removal% of flue gases increases with increasing UV intensity, and at higher UV intensity (250\u2005W), the removal% for NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> is 92% and SO<sub>2</sub> is 95% simultaneously at optimum temperature 308\u2005K. For H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV process (250\u2005W UV intensity), removal% for NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> is 95% and SO<sub>2</sub> is 100% at 313\u2005K, 0.3 LPM flow rate of flue gases. The <i>E</i><sub>EO</sub> values obtained for both processes were less than 1 for 95% NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>/SO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Science, Ahmedabad University, Ahmedabad, India."}], "LastName": "Dalal", "ForeName": "Parveen", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Science, Ahmedabad University, Ahmedabad, India."}], "LastName": "Dalai", "ForeName": "Sridhar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5550-8229"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Science, Ahmedabad University, Ahmedabad, India."}], "LastName": "Khuntia", "ForeName": "Snigdha", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "47"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37674409", "10.1080/09593330.2023.2256991"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
