Moreover, electroacupuncture (EA) has been effective in neurological recovery and pain control in dogs with thoracolumbar discopathy. EA was compared with Ozone applied at acupuncture points in dogs with signs of thoracolumbar disk disease. Chondrodystrophic mongrel dogs, with lesion scores between 1 and 4, were randomly divided into groups: EA (n\u00a0=\u00a013) - electroacupuncture at BL20, BL23, ST36, KID3 and BL60 and dry needle in lumbar Bai Hui, and OZO (n\u00a0=\u00a015) - paravertebral application of 3\u00a0mL ozone (20\u00a0\u03bcg / mL) at BL20, BL23, lumbar Bai Hui, ST36, and KID3/BL60, both groups with weekly applications. No significant differences were observed between groups in weekly blind pain assessments using a dynamic interactive visual analog scale, and neurological assessments using a numerical-functional scale. Both groups showed a progressive improvement in pain control and neurological condition, which was observed when comparing the group's EA and OZO in dogs with all lesion scores. The time of return to locomotion (days) of dogs scored 3 and 4, between groups EA (10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4) and OZO (14.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.7), had no significant differences. Ozone therapy was effective to control pain and motor rehabilitation and sensory functions of dogs with thoracolumbar discopathy signs, just as electroacupuncture. Ozone application was a quick and easy-to-handle treatment. Paravertebral and subcutaneous routes did not require anesthesia or other advanced imaging technology, besides being safe and effective."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
