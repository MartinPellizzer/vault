BAL and sputum induction (SI) are the most common methods of sampling RTLF in such studies. However, the comparability of these methods (BAL and SI) after experimental treatment has not been investigated in a head-to-head controlled trial.", "To determine whether BAL and SI are comparable and can be used in place of each other in the assessment of neutrophilic airway inflammation after ozone (O(3)) exposure, we exposed 13 asthmatic subjects to either 0.2 ppm of O(3) or filtered air (FA) followed by either BAL or SI. Subjects then underwent the alternate (O(3) or FA) exposure followed by the same method of RTLF sampling. Next, subjects repeated the same exposure protocol with the alternate method of RTLF sampling. Differences in inflammatory indexes including the percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (%PMNs) between the exposures were then correlated by regression analysis.", "The %PMNs in sputum was poorly correlated with that in BAL fluid (R = 0.12). The correlation between the %PMNs in sputum and in the bronchial fraction of BAL (BFx) fluid, however, was somewhat higher (R = 0.50). Furthermore, the uncertainty of the estimate of %PMN values in BFx fluid and BAL fluid based on those of sputum values, using regression models, was almost as great as the magnitude of the O(3) effect itself (ie, 9.7% and 5.5% estimate errors for O(3) effects of 17.0% and 7.5%, respectively).", "We concluded that SI and BAL indexes are not directly interchangeable in the assessment of O(3)-induced airway inflammation in asthmatic subjects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lung Biology Center, Northern California Center for Occupational and Environmental Health, and San Francisco General Hospital, University of California-San Francisco, Box 0843, San Francisco, CA 94143-0843, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arjomandi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidlin", "ForeName": "Isabelle", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Girling", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boylen", "ForeName": "Kevin", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferrando", "ForeName": "Ron", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balmes", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "M01 RR 00083-41", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 ES 08970", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chest", "NlmUniqueID": "0231335", "ISSNLinking": "0012-3692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sputum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics, Nonparametric"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16002965", "10.1378/chest.128.1.416", "S0012-3692(15)37976-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
