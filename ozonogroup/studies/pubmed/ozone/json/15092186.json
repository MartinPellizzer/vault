Prior to measurements the trees were treated for about one year. During the second year of treatment the fine root production of all three tree species was determined rhizoscopically. The OTC experiments were concluded after an additional three years at which time fine root and small root dry matter as well as the absolute and relative frequencies of mycorrhizae of spruce and fir were determined from soil cores. The vitality of spruce mycorrhizae was examined by fluorescein diacetate staining. In addition total contents of essential cations of spruce mycorrhizae were measured. Long-term exposure to SO(2), SO(2) + O(3), and simulated acid precipitation led to an increased mycorrhizal production by fir. On spruce, a decreased number of mycorrhizae was found in the chambers polluted with SO(2), but a high proportion of dead fine roots indicated an increased root production with an intensified turnover or a delayed decomposition of spruce mycorrhizae. The cation analyses showed an accumulation of Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) in the mycorrhizae of spruce exposed to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Botanik, Spezielle Botanik/Mykologie, Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 1, D-7400 Tuebingen 1, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "W\u00f6llmer", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kottke", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Pollut. 1990;68(3-4):following 402"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092186", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90040-j", "026974919090040J"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
