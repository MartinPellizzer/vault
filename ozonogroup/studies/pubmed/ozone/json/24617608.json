For aluminum oxide (Al2O3) ALD, water or ozone can be used as oxygen sources, but how reaction pressure influences deposition using ozone has not previously been reported. This work describes the effect of deposition pressure, between \u223c2 and 760 Torr, on ALD Al2O3 using TMA and ozone. Similar to reports for pressure dependence during TMA/water ALD, surface reaction saturation studies show self-limiting growth at low and high pressure across a reasonable temperature range. Higher pressure tends to increase the growth per cycle, especially at lower gas velocities and temperatures. However, growth saturation at high pressure requires longer O3 dose times per cycle. Results are consistent with a model of ozone decomposition kinetics versus pressure and temperature. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) results confirm the trends in growth rate and indicate that the surface reaction mechanisms for Al2O3 growth using ozone are similar under low and high total pressure, including expected trends in the reaction mechanism at different temperatures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, North Carolina State University , 911 Partners Way, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}], "LastName": "Mousa", "ForeName": "Moataz Bellah M", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oldham", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Parsons", "ForeName": "Gregory N", "Initials": "GN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24617608", "10.1021/la500796r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
