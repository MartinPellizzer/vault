More than 80% of the health benefits are estimated to occur in Asia. We estimated that BC mitigation measures would achieve approximately 98% of the deaths that would be avoided if all BC and methane mitigation measures were implemented, due to reduced BC and associated reductions of nonmethane ozone precursor and organic carbon emissions as well as stronger mortality relationships for PM(2.5) relative to ozone. Although subject to large uncertainty, these estimates and conclusions are not strongly dependent on assumptions for the concentration-response function.", "In addition to climate benefits, our findings indicate that the methane and BC emission control measures would have substantial co-benefits for air quality and public health worldwide, potentially reversing trends of increasing air pollution concentrations and mortality in Africa and South, West, and Central Asia. These projected benefits are independent of carbon dioxide mitigation measures. Benefits of BC measures are underestimated because we did not account for benefits from reduced indoor exposures and because outdoor exposure estimates were limited by model spatial resolution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460, USA. anenberg.susan@epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anenberg", "ForeName": "Susan C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "Joel", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shindell", "ForeName": "Drew", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amann", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Faluvegi", "ForeName": "Greg", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klimont", "ForeName": "Zbigniew", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janssens-Maenhout", "ForeName": "Greet", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pozzoli", "ForeName": "Luca", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Dingenen", "ForeName": "Rita", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vignati", "ForeName": "Elisabetta", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emberson", "ForeName": "Lisa", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muller", "ForeName": "Nicholas Z", "Initials": "NZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "West", "ForeName": "J Jason", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demkine", "ForeName": "Volodymyr", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hicks", "ForeName": "W Kevin", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuylenstierna", "ForeName": "Johan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raes", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramanathan", "ForeName": "Veerabhadran", "Initials": "V"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES000002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Jun;120(6):A245. doi: 10.1289/ehp.120-a245b", "PMID": "22659132"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}], "CoiStatement": "The opinions expressed in this article are the authors\u2019 and do not necessarily represent those of their employers, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
