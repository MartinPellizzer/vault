The purpose of this work was to study striatal damage and cell death induced by oxidative stress. Sixty-three male Wistar rats were divided into two groups--Group 1: animals were exposed to an air stream free of ozone for 4 h; and Group 2: animals were exposed to 1 ppm of ozone for 4 h. Four subgroups in each treatment group were then tested 3 h after control or ozone exposure for: (1) exploratory and freezing behavior; (2) lipid peroxidation levels; (3) in vivo release of amino acid and monoamine transmitters, and metabolites and nitric oxide; and (4) striatal ultrastructural changes. Results showed that the ozone decreased exploratory and increased freezing behaviors. It also increased striatal lipoperoxidation levels and basal dopamine, glutamate, and nitric oxide (arginine, citrulline, and nitrate used as indices) concentrations and decreased those of 5-HT. Concentrations of GABA were initially decreased 3 h after ozone but then were increased 3 and 5 days afterwards. Increased lipofucsine, neuronal cytoplasm and dendrite vacuolation, and dilation of rough endoplasmic reticulum cisterns and dark cells were observed in striatal medium spiny neurons in ozone-exposed rats. These alterations suggest a neurodegenerative process caused by oxidative stress after acute ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, UNAM, AP 70-250, Mexico, DF 04510, Mexico. srivas@servidor.unam.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivas-Arancibia", "ForeName": "Selva", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dorado-Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colin-Barenque", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kendrick", "ForeName": "Keith M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de la Riva", "ForeName": "Carlos", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guevara-Guzm\u00e1n", "ForeName": "Rosalinda", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Biochem Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0367050", "ISSNLinking": "0091-3057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Corpus Striatum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12667904", "10.1016/s0091-3057(03)00011-x", "S009130570300011X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
