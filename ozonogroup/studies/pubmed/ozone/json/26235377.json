Socioeconomic, clinical and environmental data were assessed using geographically weighted spatial regression analysis adjusting for spatial autocorrelation.

From 1996 to 2007 smoking, unemployment, physically unhealthy days, air pollution ozone days, percent of houses with well water, employment in the mining industry and urban residences were associated with increased rates of bladder cancer mortality (p <0.05). Model fit was significantly improved in hot spots compared to all American counties (R(2) = 0.20 vs 0.05).", "Environmental and socioeconomic factors affect bladder cancer mortality and effects appear to vary by gender and race.
