To improve the fuel performance of engines, combustor temperatures and pressures often increase, increasing NO <sub>x</sub> emissions. Conversely, combustor modifications to reduce NO <sub>x</sub> may increase CO<sub>2</sub>. Hence, a technology trade-off exists, which also translates to a trade-off between short-lived climate forcers and a long-lived greenhouse gas, CO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the NO <sub>x</sub>-O<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub> system responds in a nonlinear manner, according to both aviation emissions and background NO <sub>x</sub>. A simple climate model was modified to incorporate nonlinearities parametrized from a complex chemistry model. Case studies showed that for a scenario of a 20% reduction in NO <sub>x</sub> emissions the consequential CO<sub>2</sub> penalty of 2% actually increased the total radiative forcing (RF). For a 2% fuel penalty, NO <sub>x</sub> emissions needed to be reduced by >43% to realize an overall benefit. Conversely, to ensure that the fuel penalty for a 20% NO <sub>x</sub> emission reduction did not increase overall forcing, a 0.5% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> was found to be the \"break even\" point. The time scales of the climate effects of NO <sub>x</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> are quite different, necessitating careful analysis of proposed emissions trade-offs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science and the Environment, Faculty of Science and Engineering , Manchester Metropolitan University , Manchester M1 5GD , U.K."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3387-281X"], "LastName": "Freeman", "ForeName": "Sarah", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science and the Environment, Faculty of Science and Engineering , Manchester Metropolitan University , Manchester M1 5GD , U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "David S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science and the Environment, Faculty of Science and Engineering , Manchester Metropolitan University , Manchester M1 5GD , U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Ling L", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science and the Environment, Faculty of Science and Engineering , Manchester Metropolitan University , Manchester M1 5GD , U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skowron", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science and the Environment, Faculty of Science and Engineering , Manchester Metropolitan University , Manchester M1 5GD , U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Le\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Ruben Rodriguez", "Initials": "RR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29419283", "10.1021/acs.est.7b05719"]}}]}
