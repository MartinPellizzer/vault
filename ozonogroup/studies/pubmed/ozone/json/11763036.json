Animal infectivity using neonatal CD-1 mice was used for evaluation of oocyst viability after treatment. Kinetic models based on the linear Chick-Watson model were developed for free chlorine inactivation and ozone/free chlorine sequential inactivation for 0.4 or 1.6 log-units of ozone primary kill. At 22 degrees C. ozone pre-treatment increased the efficacy of free chlorine for about 4-6 times depending on the level of ozone primary kills. Gross kills of the ozone/free chlorine sequential inactivation were a function of ozone primary kills and increased linearly with the free chlorine C(avg)t (arithmetic average of the initial and final residual x contact time) product. Temperature was critical for both single and sequential inactivation, and the efficacy of free chlorine after 1.6 log-units of ozone primary inactivation decreased by a factor of 1.8 for every 10 degrees C temperature decrease. Given an ozone primary kill of 1.6 log-units, the free chlorine C(avg)t products required for a gross kill of 3.0 log-units were 1000, 2000 and 3,300 mgmin/L for 22 degrees C. 10 degrees C and 1degrees C, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. hanbin@ualberta.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finch", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belosevic", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium parvum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11763036", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00180-4", "S0043-1354(01)00180-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
