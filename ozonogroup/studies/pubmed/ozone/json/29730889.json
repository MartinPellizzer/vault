The age/gender-adjusted incidence rates of infantile eczema were determined using the data of outpatient visits. We analysed 1965 cases with atopic dermatitis including infantile eczema in relation to the annual means of outdoor monitoring data from 2005 through 2015 in Minsk. Logistic regression and principal component analysis were performed to determine association between the annual means of air pollutants, meteorological variables and incidences of infantile eczema.", "Higher mean annual carbon monoxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, lead, particulate matter and ground-level ozone were associated with high incidence rates of infantile eczema both in boys and girls. Higher nitrogen dioxide was associated with high incidence rates of infantile eczema in girls 1-2\u00a0years of age and boys 0-2\u00a0years of age. There were identified by principal component analysis five combinations of pollutants and meteorological factors. High incidence rates of infantile eczema were associated with the combinations contained higher levels of air pollutants and ultraviolet index, or lower \u03b2-activity of the radionuclide-associated aerosols. The higher phenol and formaldehyde levels the higher incidence rates of infantile eczema were observed among boys 0-1\u00a0years of age and girls 1-2\u00a0years of age.
