The method is formulated in the framework of analytical derivative theory, thus enabling implementation at the Hartree-Fock self-consistent-field (HF-SCF) as well as at electron-correlated levels. First-order induced current densities have been computed up to the coupled-cluster singles and doubles level (CCSD) augmented by a perturbative treatment of triple excitations [CCSD(T)] for carbon dioxide and benzene and up to the full coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT) level in the case of ozone. The applicability of the gauge including magnetically induced current method to larger molecules is demonstrated by computing first-order current densities for porphin and hexabenzocoronene at the HF-SCF and density-functional theory level. Furthermore, a scheme for obtaining quantitative values for the induced currents in a molecule via numerical integration over the current flow is presented. For benzene, a perpendicular magnetic field induces a (field dependent) ring current of 12.8 nA T(-1) at the HF-SCF level using a triple-zeta basis set augmented with polarization functions (TZP). At the CCSD(T)/TZP level the induced current was found to be 11.4 nA T(-1). Gauge invariance and its relation to charge-current conservation is discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2004 American Institute of Physics"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, P.O.
