This study conducted a comprehensive analysis on hydrogen supply methods from Australia to the Republic of Korea in environmental and economic aspects using a life cycle assessment (LCA). The blue hydrogen produced in Australia was considered for import to the Republic of Korea via ocean shipping. The study analyzed the holistic environmental effects in the life cycle of hydrogen ocean transport for various types of hydrogen storage methods (CH<sub>2</sub>, LH<sub>2</sub>, LOHC, LNH<sub>3</sub>, and LNG), as well as alternative marine fuels (MGO, LNG, LPG, CH<sub>2</sub>, LH<sub>2</sub>, LNG-LH<sub>2</sub>, MeOH, and LNH<sub>3</sub>) for ship transportation. Environmental impact performance was presented in terms of global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), eutrophication potential (EP), and particulate matter (PM). For the environmental results, sensitivity studies were conducted to analyze the effects of operating distance and cargo tank size when shipping hydrogen via ocean transport. Additionally, the GWP results of the transportation of green hydrogen and ammonia were compared with those of blue hydrogen and ammonia transport. A cost analysis was performed for the overall processes of hydrogen ocean transport, and the results were included in the study with the estimated hydrogen price for each transportation method."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
