A comparative study was performed for sonocavitation assisted ozonation under 40-120\u00a0kHz and 80-200\u00a0kHz dual frequency ultrasounds (DFUS). Based on the obtained results, the combination of 40-120\u00a0kHz i.e., low-frequency US (LFDUS) with O<sub>3</sub> exhibited excellent oxidation capacity degrading 99.37-99.69% of BTEXs in 40\u00a0min, while 86.09-91.76% of BTEX degradation was achieved after 60\u00a0min in 80-200\u00a0kHz i.e., high-frequency US (HFDUS) combined with O<sub>3</sub>. The synergistic indexes determined using degradation rate constants were found as 7.86 and 2.9 for LFDUS/O<sub>3</sub> and HFDUS/O<sub>3</sub> processes, respectively. The higher extend of BTEX degradation in both processes was observed at pH 6.5 and 10. Among the reactive oxygen species (ROSs), hydroxyl radicals (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>) were found predominant according to scavenging tests, singlet oxygen also importantly contributed in degradation, while O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> radicals had a minor contribution. Sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) ions demonstrated higher inhibitory effect compared to chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) ions in both processes. Degradation pathways of BTEX was proposed based on the intermediates identified using GC-MS technique."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
