In the laboratory scale experiments, the effect of major parameters, including pH, gas flow rate, gaseous ozone concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and hydroxyl radical scavenger (tert-butyl alcohol) on the degradation of tetracycline was studied. A pseudo-first order kinetic model was used to simulate the experimental results. The results indicated that the tetracycline degradation rate increased with pH, gaseous ozone concentration and gas flow rate. The addition of hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl radical scavenger had little effect on tetracycline removal, indicating that the direct oxidation of tetracycline by ozone was dominant process and the radical contribution to the tetracycline oxidation could be neglected. The main intermediates were separated and identified as well as the simple degradation pathway of tetracycline was proposed. The COD removal reached to 35% after 90 min reaction. The acute toxicity experiments illustrated that the Daphnia magna mortality reached the maximum after 25 min ozonation and then decreased to zero after 90 min ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
