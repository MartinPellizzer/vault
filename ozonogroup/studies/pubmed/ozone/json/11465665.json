Tropospheric ozone was continuously monitored with automatic analyzers in three stations, two located in the urban area and one in the hilly surroundings (Settignano). A biomonitoring campaign based on the tobacco cv. Bel-W3 plants was performed in the same area. The highest values were constantly recorded in the Settignano station. The highest 1-hour mean recorded was 197 nl/l; the accumulated exposure over a threshold of 40 nl/l (AOT40) was well above the critical levels standards for protection of the vegetation. A consistent temporal variation was observed and July proved to be the month with the highest ozone levels. Cumulative frequency distribution of ozone maximum daily concentrations exhibited a good fitting to log-normality. No 'week-end' effect was observed. Biomonitoring data were in good agreement with chemico-physical ones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sez Patologia Vetetale, Dip.to CDSL, Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nali", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferretti", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pellegrin i", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lorenzini", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1991;74(4):264-91", "ArticleIdList": ["15092056"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1979 Jun 22;204(4399):1273-8", "ArticleIdList": ["17813155"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manage Assoc. 1990 Oct;40(10):1378-83", "ArticleIdList": ["2257125"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11465665", "10.1023/a:1010749722546"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
