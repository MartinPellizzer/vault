Exposure to ambient air pollution leads to serious health conditions such as lower respiratory infections, cancers, diabetes mellitus type 2, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", "To estimate the burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution in South Africa (SA) for the years 2000, 2006 and 2012.", "Comparative risk assessment method was used to determine the burden of disease due to two pollutants (particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient ozone). Regionally optimised fully coupled climate chemistry models and surface air pollution observations were used to generate concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone for each SA Census Small Area Level, for the year 2012. For 2000 and 2006, population-weighted PM2.5and ozone were estimated, based on the 2012 results. Following the identification of disease outcomes associated with particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) and ozone exposure, the attributable burden of disease was estimated for 2000, 2006 and 2012. Furthermore, for the year 2012, the burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution exposure was computed at provincial levels.", "In 2012, approximately 97.6% of people in SA were exposed to PM2.5 at levels above the 2005 World Health Organization guideline: 10 \u03bcg/m3 annual mean. From 2000 to 2012, population-weighted annual average PM2.5 increased from 26.6 \u03bcg/m3 to 29.7 \u03bcg/m3, and ozone 6-month high 8-hour daily maximum increased from 64.4 parts per billion (ppb) to 72.1 ppb. At a national scale, in the year 2000, 15 619 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 8 958 - 21 849) deaths were attributed to PM2.5 exposure, while 1 326 (95% UI 534 - 1 885) deaths were attributed to ozone. In 2006, an estimated 19 672 deaths (95% UI 11 526 - 27 086) were attributed to PM2.5, and a further 1 591 deaths (95% UI 651 - 2 236) to ozone exposure. In 2012, deaths attributed to PM2.5 were 19 507 (95% UI 11 318 - 27 111), and to ozone 1 734 (95% UI 727 - 2 399). Additionally, population-weighted provincial scale analysis showed that Gauteng Province had the highest number of attributable deaths due to both PM2.5 and ozone in 2012.", "The study showed that ambient air pollution exposure is an important health risk in SA, requiring both short- and long-term intervention. In the short term, the SA Ambient Air Quality Standards and industrial minimum emissions standards need to be enforced. In the longer term, to reduce air pollution and the associated disease burden, the combustion of fossil fuels as a source of energy for power generation and transportation, as well as industrial and domestic uses, needs to be replaced with clean renewable energy sources. In addition to local measures, when the southern African prevalent anticyclonic air dynamics that transport regionally emitted pollutants into SA (especially from biomass burning) are considered, it is also advisable to establish long-term regional co-operation in reducing air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Burden of Disease Research Unit, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa. rifqah.roomaney@mrc.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Roomaney", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Burden of Disease Research Unit, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa. rifqah.roomaney@mrc.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Cairncross", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Innovation, South African Weather Service, Centurion, South Africa. rifqah.roomaney@mrc.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Tesfaye", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Health Research Unit, South African Medical Research Council, Pretoria, South Africa. rifqah.roomaney@mrc.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Kapwata", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biostatistics Research Unit, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa. rifqah.roomaney@mrc.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Abdelatif", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Innovation, South African Weather Service, Centurion, South Africa. rifqah.roomaney@mrc.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Olivier", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Innovation, South African Weather Service, Centurion, South Africa. rifqah.roomaney@mrc.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Mathibela", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Burden of Disease Research Unit, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa;
