A major dienedial-producing pathway was detected for the first time for toluene oxidation, and glyoxal and methylglyoxal were found to be minor primary oxidation products. The results suggest that secondary oxidation processes involving dienedial and epoxide primary products are likely responsible for previous observations of glyoxal and methylglyoxal products from toluene oxidation. Because the dienedial-producing pathway is a null cycle for tropospheric ozone production and glyoxal and methylglyoxal are important secondary organic aerosol precursors, these new findings have important implications for the modeling of toluene oxidation in the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio 44074, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baltaretu", "ForeName": "Cristian O", "Initials": "CO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lichtman", "ForeName": "Eben I", "Initials": "EI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hadler", "ForeName": "Amelia B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elrod", "ForeName": "Matthew J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Phys Chem A. 2009 Jul 16;113(28):8136-8; discussion 8139-40. doi: 10.1021/jp903119k", "PMID": "19537748"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19118482", "10.1021/jp806841t", "10.1021/jp806841t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
