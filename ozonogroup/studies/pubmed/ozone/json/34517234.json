However, the main drawback associated with this method is the generation of leachate from the landfill site. Leachate, a highly concentrated liquid consisting of both organic and inorganic components arises environmental issues as it contaminates the nearby aquifers. Landfill leachate treatment by conventional methods is not preferred as the treatment methods are not much effective to remove these pollutants. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) based on both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals could be a promising method to remove the micropollutants completely or convert them to non-toxic compounds. The current review focuses on the occurrence of micropollutants in landfill leachate, their detection methods and removal from landfill leachate using AOPs. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products occur in the range of 10<sup>-1</sup> to more than 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> whereas phthalates were found below the detectable limit to 384\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, pesticides in the order of 10<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and polyaromatic hydrocarbons occur in concentration from 10<sup>-2</sup> to 114.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. Solid-phase extraction is the most preferred method for extracting micropollutants from leachate and liquid chromatography (LC) - mass spectrophotometer (MS) for detecting the micropollutants. Limited studies have been focused on AOPs as a potential method for the degradation of micropollutants in landfill leachate. The potential of Fenton based techniques, electrochemical AOPs and ozonation are investigated for the removal of micropollutants from leachate whereas the applicability of photocatalysis for the removal of a wide variety of micropollutants from leachate needs in-depth studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
