CNT would experience oxidization in wastewater treatment plant due to the presence of large amount of disinfectants, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, which in turn affects the environmental fates and risks of CNT. In this study, oxidized CNT materials (O-CNTs) were prepared by treating CNT with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV and O<sub>3</sub> (denoting as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-CNT and O<sub>3</sub>-CNT, respectively). A variety of characterizations indicated that oxygen containing groups were generated on CNT surface upon the oxidation, and the O/C ratio increased in the order of pristine CNT\u202f<\u202fH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-CNT\u202f<\u202fO<sub>3</sub>-CNT. In the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the O-CNTs displayed better colloidal stability than the pristine CNT, and the stability increased with the oxidation degree (indicated by O/C ratio). This could be explained by the more negative surface charge and stronger hydrophilicity of the O-CNTs. Unexpectedly, in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the most oxidized O<sub>3</sub>-CNT exhibited the poorest colloidal stability. The abundant carboxyl groups in O<sub>3</sub>-CNT provided effective binding sites for cation bridging effect through Ca<sup>2+</sup> and led to stronger aggregation. Increasing pH was more favorable to disperse CNTs (both O-CNT and pristine CNT) in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, but much less effective in inhibiting the aggregation of O<sub>3</sub>-CNT in presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This could be explained by the stronger cation bridging effect due to enhanced deprotonation the -COOH groups at higher pH conditions. The calculated Hamaker constants of the CNTs decreased with the oxidation degree, implying that there was lower van der Waals force between the O-CNTs. The Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) calculation confirmed that O-CNTs had to overcome higher energy barrier and thus showed better colloidal stability than the pristine CNT in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
