Results show that pH played a critical role in both ozonation and catalytic ozonation for ammonia removal, especially in the ozonation rate of ammonia and the types of oxidation products. For single ozonation, both O<sub>3</sub> and OH contributed to ammonia degradation. Lower pH is beneficial to high selectivity of gaseous products (N<sub>2</sub> or N<sub>2</sub>O) in the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup>. Significantly enhanced efficiency of ammonia removal was obtained under the catalysis of MgO, which worked as a solid alkali as well as a catalyst, facilitating ammonia oxidation both in the solution and on the MgO surface. Molecular O<sub>3</sub> dominated ammonia removal in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation system, while the contribution of OH was not significant in quantity and a small part of ammonia was degraded by the reaction of ClO<sub>x</sub><sup>-</sup> with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. A relatively high removal efficiency (77.53%\u02dc80.17%) of ammonia could also be achieved in the temperature range of 0\u2103\u02dc10\u2103, which indicates that catalytic ozonation over catalysts like MgO may be a potential method to control ammonia pollution during cold weather or under other conditions difficult for biological treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
