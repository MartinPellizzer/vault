The operating variables investigated were the dose of alumina catalyst and solution pH. Results showed that using ozone and alumina leads to a significant increase in 2,4-D removal in comparison to non-catalytic ozonation and adsorption processes. The observed reaction rate constants (k(obs)) for 2,4-D during ozonation were found to increase linearly with increasing catalyst dose. At pH 5, the k(obs) value increased from 19.3 to 26 M(-1) s(-1) and 67 M(-1) s(-1) when varying the alumina dose from 1 to 2 and 4 g L(-1), respectively. As pH was increased, higher reaction rates were observed for both non-catalytic ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes. Thus, at pH 3 and using a catalyst dose of 8 g L(-1), the k(obs) values for non-catalytic ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes were 3.4 and 58.9 M(-1) s(-1), respectively, whereas at pH 5 reaction rate constants of 6.5 and 128.5 M(-1) s(-1) were observed, respectively. Analysis of total organic carbon suggested that catalytic ozonation with alumina achieved a considerable level of mineralization of 2,4-D. Adsorption of 2,4-D on alumina was found to play an important role in the catalytic ozonation process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guzman-Perez", "ForeName": "Carlos A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soltan", "ForeName": "Jafar", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robertson", "ForeName": "Jared", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22494378", "10.1080/03601234.2012.665675"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
