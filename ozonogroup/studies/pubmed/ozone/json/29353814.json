We begin with the growth of these samples, and highlight the key characteristics of ozone-assisted molecular beam epitaxy required for their production. The transport characteristics of these structures are found to rival that of traditional semiconductor material systems, as signified by the high electron mobility ([Formula: see text] cm<sup>2</sup> Vs<sup>-1</sup>) and rich quantum Hall features. Owing to a large effective mass and small dielectric constant, interaction effects are an order of magnitude stronger in comparison with the well studied GaAs-based 2DES. The strong correlation physics results in robust Fermi-liquid renormalization of the effective mass and spin susceptibility of carriers, which in turn dictates the parameter space for the quantum Hall effect. Finally, we explore the quantum Hall effect with a particular emphasis on the spin degree of freedom of carriers, and how their large spin splitting allows control of the ground states encountered at ultra-low temperatures within the fractional quantum Hall regime. We discuss in detail the physics of even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states, whose observation and underlying character remain elusive and exotic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstrasse 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Falson", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawasaki", "ForeName": "Masashi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rep Prog Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "19620690R", "ISSNLinking": "0034-4885"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29353814", "10.1088/1361-6633/aaa978"]}}]}
