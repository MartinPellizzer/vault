Assessing the impacts of air pollution on elementary students is critical for developing preparedness response strategies for this sensitive group. In the 2016-17 academic year, up to 687,748 groups of illness-related absence records and the information on whether the absentee had gone to a hospital or not were collected from 2564 elementary schools across Jiangsu Province China. We explored the associations between air pollution and illness-related records using a time-stratified case-crossover analysis with distributed lag non-linear design. An increase of 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in the current-day concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was positively associated with illness-related absenteeism overall. The excess risk of absenteeism was 4.52 % (95%CI 4.37-4.67 %) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 0.25 % (95%CI 0.01-0.36 %) for O<sub>3</sub>. The risk associated with O<sub>3</sub> was boosted for the frequent absentees who tended to have basic diseases or were more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Students in 43.1 % illness-related absenteeism, mainly due to highly infectious diseases, only received home nursing without going to a hospital. The increase in the number of illness cases associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> estimated based on the illness-related absence data was 41.5 % and 18.6 % higher than that evaluated based on hospital visit records. Such underestimations persisted in sensitivity analyses and persisted in subgroups classified by gender or grade. Together, the performance of illness-related absence records far outweighed that of hospital visit data regarding the thorough evaluation of air pollution-related illness cases for elementary students. Improvement in air quality and home health care education are warranted as well for the health benefits of children."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
