In the literature, thousands of articles on this issue at various sophisticated levels of knowledge can be found. The articles are mostly suitable as an extension of scientific knowledge; however, regarding potential costs and respectively scale-up problems, the applications are limited. It turns out that the vast majority of contaminated water can be effectively decontaminated by simple methods, in a coagulation-sedimentation sequence \u2192 simple oxidation and reduction methods for separated water (Fenton reaction, photocatalysis, ozonation, reductive dehalogenation with zero metals) \u2192 adsorption of remaining pollutants on simple sorbents, eg on biochar \u2192 (possibly bioremediation or advanced physical methods such as membrane filtration) \u2192 final purification on activated carbon. Due to the usually limited volume loads of soils with pollutants in the vicinity of brownfields, it is not economically advantageous to build demanding decontamination units for water purification. Usually, the simplest solution is the system to pump-and-treat around the source of contamination, with the main emphasis on highly effective removal of pollutants from water that returns underground. Groundwater was taken from boreholes leading to the saturated zone in the vicinity of several selected industrial brownfields. The solutions are shown on individual typical cases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
