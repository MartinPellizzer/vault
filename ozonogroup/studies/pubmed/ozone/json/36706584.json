Hourly speciated VOC data measured from April to August 2020 in Tianjin, China were used to analyze the photochemical losses of VOC species and assess the impacts of photochemical losses on source apportionment by comparing the positive matrix factorization (PMF) results based on observed and initial concentration data (OC-PMF and IC-PMF). The initial concentrations of the VOC species were estimated using a photochemical age-based parameterization method. The results suggest that the average photochemical loss of total VOCs (TVOCs) during the ozone pollution period was 2.4 times higher than that during the non-ozone pollution period. The photochemical loss of alkenes was more significant than that of the other VOC species. Temperature has an important effect on photochemical losses, and different VOC species have different sensitivities to temperature; high photochemical losses mainly occurred at temperatures between 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 35\u00a0\u00b0C. Photochemical losses reduced the concentrations of highly reactive species in the OC-PMF factor profile. Compared with the IC-PMF results, the OC-PMF contributions of biogenic emissions and polymer production-related industrial sources were underestimated by 73\u00a0% and 50\u00a0%, respectively, likely due to the oxidation of isoprene and propene, respectively. The contribution of diesel and gasoline evaporation was underestimated by 39\u00a0%, which was likely due to the loss of m,p-xylene. Additionally, the contributions of liquefied petroleum gas, vehicle emissions, natural gas, and oil refinery were underestimated by 31\u00a0%, 29\u00a0%, 23\u00a0%, and 13\u00a0%, respectively. When the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were higher than 140\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> or the temperatures were higher than 30\u00a0\u00b0C, the photochemical losses from most sources increased substantially. Additionally, solar radiation produced different photochemical losses for different source types."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
