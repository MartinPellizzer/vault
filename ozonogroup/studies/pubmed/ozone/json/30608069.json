Values of k(Cl + 1-trifluoromethyl-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (TFMTFCB)) = (1.16 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10-14 and k(OH + TFMTFCB) = (3.51 \u00b1 0.88) \u00d7 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 were measured. No reactivity of TFMTFCB towards ozone was observed. The atmospheric lifetime of TFMTFCB is determined by the reaction with OH and is approximately 330 days. The chlorine initiated oxidation gives C(O)F2 and CF3C(O)F as the dominant products in yields of (92 \u00b1 2)% and (89 \u00b1 2)%, respectively. The OH radical initiated oxidation gives C(O)F2 and CF3C(O)F as the dominant products in yields of (91 \u00b1 6)% and (84 \u00b1 4)%, respectively. The GWP100 was calculated as 44. The atmospheric chemistry of the title compound, a cyclic halogenated alkane, is discussed in the context of other halogenated cyclo-alkanes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 5, Copenhagen DK-2100, Denmark. ojn@chem.ku.dk."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sulbaek Andersen", "ForeName": "Mads Peter", "Initials": "MP", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nielsen", "ForeName": "Ole John", "Initials": "OJ", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30608069", "10.1039/c8cp04228d"]}}]}
