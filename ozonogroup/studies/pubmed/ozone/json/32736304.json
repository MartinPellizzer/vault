We evaluated the following strategies for elimination of mature biofilm formed by Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. on stainless steel surfaces: acidic electrolyzed water (AEW), ozone water (OW), or ultrasound (40\u00a0kHz) alone, and combinations of ultrasound and disinfectants. The dynamics of elimination by combinations were determined using the Weibull and biphasic models. Treatment with AEW alone reduced the number of biofilm cells by approximately 3.0\u00a0log\u00a0cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas less than 0.8\u00a0log\u00a0cfu/cm<sup>2</sup> of cells reduction was observed in biofilm exposed to OW or ultrasound alone, even with treatment for 20\u00a0min. The combination of AEW and ultrasound produced an obvious synergistic effect on biofilm reduction, achieving approximately 4.8\u00a0log\u00a0cfu/cm<sup>2</sup> reduction in Salmonella spp. biofilm. Interestingly, the biphasic model was a better fit than the Weibull model for the elimination process of mature biofilm formed by both pathogens and subjected to a combination of ultrasound and AEW, as determined by smaller values of the statistical parameters RMSE and AIC, although both models could evaluate the dynamic processes. Our findings indicated that a combination of ultrasound and AEW could effectively reduce the biofilm formed by pathogens on food contact surfaces, and that the biphasic model could predict the number of residual cells after biofilm exposure to this intervention approach."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
