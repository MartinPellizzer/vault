The VO<sub>x</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O layer was in situ prepared by a combined H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) processing on a VO<sub>x</sub> layer. The as-prepared VO<sub>x</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O layer featured a work function of 5.0 \u00b1 0.1 eV, high transmittance, and better interface properties compared to those of the generally prepared VO<sub>x</sub> (UVO or thermal annealing) layers. PSCs based on poly[(ethylhexyl-thiophenyl)-benzodithiophene-(ethylhexyl)-thienothiophene]/[6,6]-phenyl-C<sub>71</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester using the VO<sub>x</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O layer as the HTL yielded high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 8.11%, outperforming the devices with VO<sub>x</sub> layers (PCE of 6.79% for the UVO-processed VO<sub>x</sub> layer and 6.10% for the thermally annealed VO<sub>x</sub> layer) and conventional polyethylenedioxythiophene-polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layers (PCE of 7.67%). The improved PCE was attributed to the enhanced J<sub>SC</sub> and/or fill factor, which mainly correlate to the improved interfacial contact between the photoactive layer and the indium tin oxide/HTL or cathode when using the VO<sub>x</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O layer as the HTL. A similar improvement in the PCE was also observed for the PSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenyl-C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester. In addition, PSCs with a VO<sub>x</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O layer as the HTL showed a higher stability than that of those with a PEDOT:PSS layer. Hence, it would be possible to use this simply and in situ prepared VO<sub>x</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O layer as an inexpensive HTL for high-performance PSCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for New Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University , Qingdao 266071, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy, Soochow University , Suzhou 215006, China."}], "LastName": "Cong", "ForeName": "Hailin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for New Fiber Materials and Modern Textile, Growing Base for State Key Laboratory, College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University , Qingdao 266071, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy, Soochow University , Suzhou 215006, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Dongwei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy, Soochow University , Suzhou 215006, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Bingbing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy, Soochow University , Suzhou 215006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Dongying", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy, Soochow University , Suzhou 215006, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy, Soochow University , Suzhou 215006, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0278-5502"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy, Soochow University , Suzhou 215006, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Lai", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28470056", "10.1021/acsami.7b02164"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
