Photosynthetic (14)CO(2) uptake was measured in situ. Net photosynthesis, dark respiration, and CO(2) compensation concentration at 2 and 21% O(2) were measured in the laboratory. Leaf segments were freeze-clamped in situ for the determination of the steady state levels of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, triose-phosphate, ATP, ADP, AMP, and activity of ribulose, 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Photosynthesis of flag leaves was highest in filtered air and decreased in response to increasing mean ozone concentration. CO(2) compensation concentration and the ratio of dark respiration to net photosynthesis increased with ozone concentration. The decrease in photosynthesis was associated with a decrease in chlorophyll, soluble protein, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity, ribulose bisphosphate, and adenylates. No decrease was found for triose-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate. The ratio of ATP to ADP and of triosephosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate were increased suggesting that photosynthesis was limited by pentose phosphate reductive cycle activity. No limitation occurred due to decreased access of CO(2) to photosynthetic cells since the decrease in stomatal conductance with increasing ozone concentration did not account for the decrease in photosynthesis. Ozonestressed leaves showed an increased degree of activation of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and a decreased ratio of ribulose bisphosphate to initial activity of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Nevertheless, it is suggested that photosynthesis in ozone stressed leaves is limited by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylation possibly due to an effect of ozone on the catalysis by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eidgen\u00f6ssische Forschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Agrikulturchemie und Umwelthygiene, CH-3097 Liebefeld-Bern, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lehnherr", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00e4chler", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grandjean", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuhrer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1987 Sep;85(1):152-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16665647"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 May 7;72:248-54", "ArticleIdList": ["942051"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Oct;73(2):291-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16663210"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Sep;73(1):185-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16663173"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 May;87(1):46-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16666124"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1985 Nov 1;230(4725):566-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17809689"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1977 Oct;60(4):606-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16660147"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1973 Feb;51(2):378-81", "ArticleIdList": ["16658333"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16666430", "PMC1055725", "10.1104/pp.88.4.1115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
