The suitability of the clones as possible replacements for tobacco as bioindicators in forested areas was tested. The life span of leaves of the ozone-sensitive clones was distinctly reduced by ozone. The difference to controls was significant even in the relatively clean air at Birmensdorf. Growth was diminished, too, but the decrease in height was much less pronounced than that in weight. In sensitive clones an after-effect was detectable, since the weight of new shoots (grown from reserves) decreased with increasing ozone stress in the previous year. Since the tolerant clone grew less, it is-at first sight-of decreased economic interest from the point of view of rapid productivity. In the long run, however, it might be economically interesting because it may be able to maintain productivity (although at a lower level) due to better competitive strength."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Forestry Research, 8903-Birmensdorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092605", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90002-4", "0269749188900024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
