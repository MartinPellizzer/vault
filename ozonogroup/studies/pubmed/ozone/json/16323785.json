In July and August 2003, we observed the total OH reactivity in a suburban area of Tokyo. More than 90% of the data of the measured OH loss rates were higher than the calculated values with simultaneously measured concentrations of various trace species even though the rate coefficient of the OH + NO2 reaction was measured by us. We concluded that this discrepancy is due to the existence of unmeasured volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We estimated the potential of the photochemical ozone production in the case of including the unknown species as VOCs and excluding the missing sink, respectively. When the unknown species were included as VOCs, the potential increases from 32% to 88%. This result indicates the photochemical production rates of ozone in the urban air are substantially greater than expected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-1-8, Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan. sadanaga@chem.osakafu-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadanaga", "ForeName": "Yasuhiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshino", "ForeName": "Ayako", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "Shungo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kajii", "ForeName": "Yoshizumi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16323785", "10.1021/es049457p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
