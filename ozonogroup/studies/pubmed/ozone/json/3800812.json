The purpose of this study was to determine whether this hyperresponsiveness was present earlier than 24 h or persisted beyond 24 h. Four groups of subjects (n = 6,6,7,7) were exposed to 0.25 ppm ozone and then reexposed at 12, 24, 48, or 72 h, respectively. During the 1-h exposures (Ta = 20 degrees C, RH = 70%) all subjects exercised continuously at approximately 65% of their respective peak VO2; VE averaged 63 L X min-1. The decrease in FEV1.0 after the second ozone exposure was significantly larger than that after the first for subjects reexposed at 12 or 24 h; FEV1.0 dropped 12% and 19% in the 12 h group, and 20% and 35% in the 24 h group. Subjects reexposed at 48 or 72 h had FEV1.0 responses which were not significantly different from the first exposure. Delta FEV1.0 on the first and second exposures were significantly correlated (r = 0.59). Symptoms generally paralleled changes in function. We conclude that the hyperresponsiveness to ozone following exposure to 0.25 ppm ozone under the conditions of this study is apparent within 12 h and is not present at 72 h."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horvath", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Aviat Space Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7501714", "ISSNLinking": "0095-6562"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Volume Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3800812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
