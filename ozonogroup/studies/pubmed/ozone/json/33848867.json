In this study, ozone, water-soluble ions in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the corresponding meteorological factors in the stable boundary layer, RL and mixing layer were observed by portable instruments carried on a tethered balloon over the North China Plain. The ozone concentration significantly increased in the RL compared to that in the stable boundary layer, while particulate nitrate significantly decreased, except in the clouds. Unfavorable environmental conditions, i.e., high temperature, low relative humidity, low aerosol surface area, and weak particle acidity, are not conducive to dinitrogen pentoxide uptake and hydrolysis to form particulate nitrate in the RL, and are conducive to the volatilization of nitrate to a gaseous state. Thus, our observations differed from traditional reports and confirmed that the morning peak of particulate nitrate at ground level is not related to the downward transport of nitrate from the RL. In addition, evidence for nitrate formation in cloudy weather is provided, and the possible impact on ozone is discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
