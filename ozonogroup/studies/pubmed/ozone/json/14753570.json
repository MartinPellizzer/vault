Filtration experiments have been carried out using four different water sources within Istanbul. A 1 m deep bed of 0.8-1.2 mm silica sand was used as the filter medium. The filter was operated at a rate of 11.5 m/hr. Raw water turbidities ranged from 2.3 NTU to 10.0 NTU. Effluent turbidity and particle count values were monitored using an on-line turbidimeter and an on-line particle counter. With all the waters studied in this work, preozonation improved particle removal in direct filtration. With three of the mentioned waters, it was possible to achieve turbidity values below 1.0 NTU without a coagulant by applying ozone at a rate between 1.7-1.8 mg/L. It was not possible to reduce the turbidity of one of the waters to below 2.7 NTU even with very high ozone dosages. The need for pilot testing before deciding if this treatment method is applicable to a given water is underlined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ITU, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Dept. of Environmental Engineering, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey. yuksel@itu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Y\u00fcksel", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akgiray", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soyer", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14753570"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
