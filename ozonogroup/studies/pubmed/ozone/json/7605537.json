Specific substances such as ozone, cadmium, and molybdenum have unique diseases associated with them. Sadly, artists may not have the medical knowledge to know how to deal with or avoid hazards. They and their immediate families often may be at risk. Many artists are not educated in what protective gear to use and do not have the money to purchase the specialized equipment for their particular work, or they refuse to wear protective gear because they are uncomfortable in the conditions encountered in the workplace. Education is often required for the use of the protective gear (respiratory, eyewear, contact protection). To make matters worse, artists are poorly protected from toxins. Government regulations are not adequate to protect self-employed artists. Laws regulating children's exposure do not address long-term toxicity. Most artists with acute problems present to the ED first. An awareness of the occupational hazards to which self-employed artists are exposed will prevent the treating physician from overlooking important clues. When an artist presents with unusual symptoms, the physician must get a complete occupational history and must have the patient bring a list or samples of any substances to which he or she has been exposed. In essence, artists are a group of enthusiastic, hardworking people that can be protected by a keen awareness of these basic principles by the treating physician."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Louisiana State University Medical School, New Orleans, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lesser", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weiss", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Emerg Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8309942", "ISSNLinking": "0735-6757"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paintings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Printing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sculpture"}], "NumberOfReferences": "36"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7605537", "10.1016/0735-6757(95)90138-8", "0735-6757(95)90138-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
