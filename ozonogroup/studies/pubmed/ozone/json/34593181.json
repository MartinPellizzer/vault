However, the surface water and groundwater near the coastal areas often contain high concentrations of bromide ion (Br<sup>-</sup>). Considering the risk of bromate (BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) formation in ozonation of the sand-filtered water, the inhibitory efficiencies of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) on BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation during ozonation process were compared. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effectively inhibited BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation at an initial Br<sup>-</sup> concentration amended to 350\u00a0\u00b5g/L. The inhibition efficiencies reached 59.6 and 100% when the mass ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> was 0.25 and > 0.5, respectively. The UV<sub>254</sub> and total organic carbon (TOC) also decreased after adding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, while the formation potential of trihalomethanes (THMsFP) increased especially in subsequent chlorination process at a low dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. To control the formation of both BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and THMs, a relatively large dose of O<sub>3</sub> and a high ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>were generally needed. NH<sub>3</sub> addition inhibited BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation when the background ammonia nitrogen (NH<sub>3</sub>N) concentration was low. There was no significant correlation between BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition efficiency and NH<sub>3</sub> dose, and a small amount of NH<sub>3</sub>N (0.2\u00a0mg/L) could obviously inhibit BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation. The oxidation of NOM seemed unaffected by NH<sub>3</sub> addition, and the structure of NOM reflected by synchronous fluorescence (SF) scanning remained almost unchanged before and after adding NH<sub>3</sub>. Considering the formation of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and THMs, the optimal dose of NH<sub>3</sub> was suggested to be 0.5\u00a0mg/L."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
