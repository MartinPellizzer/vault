Measurements of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein, ascorbate, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid hydroperoxides were made immediately after O3 exposure and 12 and 24 hours later. DFO (25 mg/kg) decreased BALF protein concentration (p < 0.05) and was associated with higher BALF ascorbate concentrations (p < 0.01) in O3-exposed animals. Ferric-DFO did not show these protective effects. No peroxides were found in BALF from any control or O3-exposed animals (detection limit: H2O2, 1 pmol; lipid hydroperoxides, 0.3 pmol). Higher DFO doses (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) did not decrease BALF protein concentration immediately after O3 exposure or 12 hours later. Indeed, the highest dose was toxic to O3-exposed animals. Although DFO is able to protect against O3-induced lung damage in rats, apparently by chelating iron, its effect dose range appears to be narrow."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616-8542."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Louie", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arata", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Offerdahl", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Halliwell", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Lab Clin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0375375", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2143"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J06Y7MXW4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Deferoxamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Deferoxamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insufflation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8445299", "0022-2143(93)90287-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
