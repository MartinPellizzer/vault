Treatment of the periodontitis is a key challenge since the disease occurs due to microbial biofilm which is extremely resistant to host response and antimicrobials. Among non-surgical methods, scaling and root planning (SRP) is considered as the fundamental method and results in the utmost improvements. However, complete elimination of subgingival calculus is difficult. A substitute treatment in inhibition of subgingival microbiota can be attained by ozonated water at a concentration of 0.5-4\u00a0mg/L. Lately, laser light therapy has been proposed in periodontal therapy in an endeavor to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of bacterial elimination and root surface debridement.", "26 patients with chronic periodontitis were selected. The selected arches were randomly divided into two groups: Group-A was subjected to SRP\u00a0+\u00a0Ozone-Therapy and Group-B to SRP\u00a0+\u00a0Photodynamic-Therapy. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 1&2months. Microbial parameters were recorded at baseline and 2-months.", "For both the groups significant decrease in clinical parameters were seen from baseline to 1 month and further in 2 months. On intergroup comparison of clinical parameters no significant result was found. Both the groups showed significant decrease in microbial parameters was seen from baseline to 2 months. On intergroup comparison of microbial parameters no significant result was found.", "Clinically and microbiologically, there was significant difference in both the groups between all time periods (P < 0.001), however there was no significant difference between the two groups at all periods (P > 0.05)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
