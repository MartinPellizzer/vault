Prior to the O(3)/GAC treatment, the wastewater was subjected to conventional primary and secondary treatments in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The effluent from the WWTP presented high organic load (COD>500 mg/l and TOC>150 mg/l), which could be much reduced by the O(3)/GAC treatment. Results from the O(3)/GAC experiments were compared with those obtained in single ozonation, single adsorption onto GAC and sequential O(3)-GAC adsorption experiments. While single processes and the sequential one showed limited capacity to remove organic matter for the food-processing effluent (COD removal <40%), the simultaneous O(3)/GAC process led to decreases of COD up to 82% at the conditions here applied. The combined process also improved the ozone consumption, which decreased from about 19 g O(3)/g TOC (single ozonation process) to 8.2-10.7 g O(3)/g TOC (O(3)/GAC process). The reusability of the GAC throughout a series of consecutive O(3)/GAC experiments was studied with no apparent loss of activity for a neutral GAC (PZC = 6.7) but for a basic GAC (PZC = 9.1)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.
