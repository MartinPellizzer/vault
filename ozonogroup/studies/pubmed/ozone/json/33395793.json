Compared to conventional bubbles (diameters larger than 1\u202fmm), microbubbles (diameter less than 50\u202f\u03bcm) have special interfacial characteristics that are probably advantageous in ozonation. However, the mechanisms involved are still unclear and therefore our primary aim here was to explore the interfacial effect of microbubbles during ozonation process. Phenol and nitrobenzene degradation by ozone microbubbles and conventional bubbles were carried out across a broad pH range. We found that microbubble decomposition of pollutants was markedly more efficient than conventional bubbles in terms of ozone consumption. Hydroxyl radical scavenger experiments of phenol revealed that the enhancement of microbubble might result from the increase of ozone concentration in interfacial region and a mathematical simulation further proved this synthesis by showing that ozone concentration is not homogenous throughout the reaction medium and forms a steep gradient in the liquid film of microbubbles. As for nitrobenzene, the acceleration of hydroxyl radicals was supposed to be the dominate factor which might be the consequence of high gas concentration in liquid film. These findings shed light on the mechanism of interfacial reaction in microbubble ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
