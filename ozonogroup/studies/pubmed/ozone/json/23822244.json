The present study focuses on the production of an alkyl-substituted Criegee intermediate, CH3CHOO, in a pulsed supersonic expansion, and then utilizes VUV photoionization at 118 nm and UV-induced depletion of the m\u2215z = 60 signal to probe the B (1)A(') \u2190 X (1)A(') transition. The UV-induced depletion approaches 100% near the peak of the profile at 320 nm, indicating rapid dynamics in the B state, and corresponds to a peak absorption cross section of \u223c5 \u00d7 10(-17) cm(2) molecule(-1). The electronic spectrum for CH3CHOO is similar to that reported recently for CH2OO, but shifted 15 nm to shorter wavelength, which will result in a longer tropospheric lifetime for CH3CHOO with respect to solar photolysis. Complementary electronic structure calculations (EOM-CCSD) are carried out for the B and X potentials of these Criegee intermediates along the O-O coordinate. An intramolecular interaction stabilizes the ground state of the syn-conformer of CH3CHOO relative to anti-CH3CHOO, and indicates that the syn-conformer will be the more abundant species in the expansion. The excited B electronic state of syn-CH3CHOO is also predicted to be destabilized relative to that for anti-CH3CHOO and CH2OO, in accord with the shift in the B-X transition observed experimentally. Hydroxyl radicals produced concurrently with the generation of the Criegee intermediates are detected by 1+1(') resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization. The OH yield observed with CH3CHOO is 4-fold larger than that from CH2OO, consistent with prior studies of OH generation from alkene ozonolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6323, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beames", "ForeName": "Joseph M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lester", "ForeName": "Marsha I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23822244", "10.1063/1.4810865"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
