Plants grown under elevated CO(2) experience physiological changes that influence their suitability as food. Previous studies have found increased insect herbivory on plants grown under elevated CO(2). To determine effects of consuming foliage of soybean (Glycine max) grown under elevated CO(2) on adult survivorship and fecundity, Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica Newman) were fed for the duration of their adult lives leaves grown under elevated CO(2) (550 mumol/mol), under ambient atmosphere (370 mumol/mol), or grown under ambient atmosphere but supplemented with a solution of sugars. To determine effects of a diet of foliage grown under elevated ozone (O(3)), another anthropogenic gaseous pollutant, beetles in the laboratory were fed soybean leaves grown under elevated CO(2), elevated O(3), or a combination of both elevated gases. Leaf tissue was also analyzed for longevity-enhancing antioxidants, because increases in dietary antioxidants can increase lifespan. Lifespan of Japanese beetles was prolonged by 8-25% when fed foliage developed under elevated CO(2), but consuming foliage that had taken up sugars to approximately the same level as foliage grown under elevated CO(2) had no effect on fecundity or longevity. Females consuming elevated CO(2) foliage laid approximately twice as many eggs as females fed foliage grown under ambient conditions. Consuming foliage grown under elevated O(3) had no effect on fecundity. No significant differences in total antioxidant content of foliage from ambient and elevated CO(2) conditions were detected. Although the precise mechanism is unclear, by altering components of leaf chemistry other than sugar content, elevated CO(2) may increase populations of Japanese beetles and their impact on crop productivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Department of Entomology, 320 Morrill Hall, 505 S.
