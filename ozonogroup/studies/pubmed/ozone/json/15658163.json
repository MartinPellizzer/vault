Both versions have been applied to routine data from 1989-1991 in five areas in the United States. In particular, extent parameters, which reveal the relative merit of VOC and NOx controls in reducing high ozone levels, have been calculated. Preliminary applications of SPM reveal interesting features with respect to VOC vs. NOx controls in reducing high ozone levels. For hourly data with ozone > or =0.08 ppm, distributions of extent parameters resulting from the modified SPM show the effectiveness of VOC controls at more monitoring sites than those from Johnson's SPM; however, relative features between the two versions are similar. On the other hand, for hourly data with ozone > or =0.12 ppm, the two SPM versions show very similar relative effectiveness of VOC and NOx controls with chosen values of model parameters. To improve the credibility of SPM, the range of validity of relationships between maximum smog produced or maximum ozone and NOx concentrations must be determined, and the parameters in these relationships must be better determined for typical VOC mixtures. Another essential parameter, which determines the fractional loss of NOy (NO and its oxidation products) from the gas phase must be better determined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ford Research Laboratory, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan 48121, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suzio", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15658163", "10.1080/10473289.1995.10467336"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
