The toxicity of particle-phase amines is of great concern in the atmospheric chemistry community. Degradation of particulate amines may lead to secondary products in the particle phase, which are associated with changes in the adverse health impacts of aerosols. In this study, O<sub>3</sub> oxidation of particulate trimethylamine (TMA) formed via heterogeneous uptake of TMA by (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>HSO<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, was investigated with in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). HCOOH, HCHO, CH<sub>3</sub>N\u2550CH<sub>2</sub>, (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NCHO, CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>N(OH)CHO, CH<sub>3</sub>NHOH and H<sub>2</sub>O were identified as products on all the substrates based upon IR (one-dimensional IR and two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy), quantum chemical calculation and PTR-MS results. A reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the observed products. This work demonstrates that oxidation might be a degradation pathway of particulate amines in the atmosphere. This will aid in understanding the fate of particulate amines formed by nucleation and heterogeneous uptake and their potential health impacts during atmospheric aging."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Yanli", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Urban Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yongchun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Urban Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Biwu", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Urban Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tianzeng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shaoxin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Beijing University of Technology , Beijing 100022, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Beijing University of Technology , Beijing 100022, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Shuiyuan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27626464", "10.1021/acs.est.6b04375"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
