The ozonated water sample is injected into a pure water carrier and mixed with a dye reagent in front of a photodetector. Many reagents undergo fast CL reactions with aqueous ozone. Most of these reactions display considerable selectivity for ozone over other oxidants of importance in water treatment. Even when there is steady-state response to another oxidant, significant discrimination against the interferents is possible by taking advantage of the much faster kinetics of the CL reaction with ozone. A simple design of a Siemens-type ozone generator and preparation of standard ozone solutions are also described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79409-1061, U.S.A."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bellamy", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dasgupta", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Talanta", "NlmUniqueID": "2984816R", "ISSNLinking": "0039-9140"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18965422", "10.1016/0039-9140(92)80066-m", "0039-9140(92)80066-M"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
