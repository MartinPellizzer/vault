One potential source of this inconsistency is the difference in exposure time metrics. This study aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient ozone, greenness, and mortality from HS using exposure metrics at different times. We also examined whether greenness exposure modified the relationship between ozone exposure and mortality due to HS. The study population consisted of 45771 participants aged \u226540\u202fy residing in 20 counties in Shandong Province who were followed up from 2013 to 2019. Ozone exposure metrics (annual mean and warm season) and the normalized difference a measure of greenness exposure, were calculated. The relationship between environmental exposures (ozone and greenness exposures) and mortality from HS was assessed using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models, and the modification of greenness exposure was examined using stratified analysis with interaction terms. The person-years at the end of follow-up were 90,663. With full adjustments, the risk of death from hemorrhagic stroke increased by 5% per interquartile range increase in warm season ozone [hazard ratio =1.05; 95\u202f% confidence interval: 1.01-1.08]. No clear association was observed between annual ozone and mortality HS. Both the annual and summer NDVI were found to reduce the risk of HS mortality. The relationships were influenced by age, sex, and residence (urban or rural). Furthermore, greenness exposure was shown to have a modifying effect on the relationship between ozone exposure and the occurrence of HS mortality (P for interaction = 0.001). Long-term exposure to warm season O<sub>3</sub> was positively associated with HS mortality, while greenness exposure was inversely associated with HS mortality. Greenness exposure may mitigate the negative effects of warm season ozone exposure on HS mortality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
