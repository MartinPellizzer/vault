Notwithstanding this, there is limited evidence regarding the impact of short-term exposure to ambient ozone on cardiovascular mortality in the Chinese population. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to address this important question. The random-effects model was applied to pool the results from individual studies. Finally, 32 effect estimates extracted from 19 studies were pooled in this meta-analysis. The pooled relative risk for cardiovascular mortality for each 10\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increment in ozone concentration was 1.0068 (95% CI: 1.0049, 1.0086). Ths significant positive association between ozone exposure and cardiovascular mortality was also observed in different two-pollutant models. This meta-analysis revealed that exposure to ozone was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in China, and more efforts on controlling the population from ozone are needed to improve cardiovascular health of Chinese population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.
