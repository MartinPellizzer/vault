The impact of ambient temperature on the VOC released from these fugitive emission sources has also been rarely reported. In order to establish VOC source profiles for thirteen volatile emission sources, a sampling campaign was conducted in Central China, and five types of sources were investigated both in winter and summer. The dominant VOC groups varied in different sources, and they were alkanes (78.6%), alkenes (53.1%), aromatics (55.1%), halohydrocarbons (80.7%) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) (76.0%), respectively. Ambient temperature showed different impacts on VOC source profiles and specific species ratios. The mass percentages of halohydrocarbons emitted from color printing and waste transfer station in summer were 42 times and 20 times higher than those in winter, respectively. The mass percentages of OVOCs emitted from car painting, waste transfer station and laundry emission sources were much higher in summer (7.9-27.8%) than those in winter (0.8-2.6%). On the contrary, alkanes from color printing, car painting and waste transfer stations were about 11, 4 and 5 times higher in winter than those in summer, respectively. The coefficient of divergence values for the source profiles obtained in winter and summer ranged in 0.3-0.7, indicating obvious differences of source profiles. Benzene/toluene ratio varied in 0.00-0.76, and it was in the range of 0.02-0.50 in winter and 0.04-0.52 in summer for the same sources, respectively. Hexanal, isobutene, m,p-xylene, toluene, 2-methylacrolein, styrene, 1-hexane and cis-2-butene dominated the ozone formation potentials (OFP). The OFP summer/winter differences were 5-320 times by MIR method and 1-79 times by Propy-Equiv method, respectively. This study firstly gave direct evidence that ambient temperature modified the mass percentages of VOC species obviously. It is important for improving VOC source apportionment and chemical reactivity simulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
