The hydrogen peroxide measurements are the first reported for the United Kingdom and show clear diurnal trends and correlate with ozone measurements. Measurements were made during a photochemical episode when a peak hydrogen peroxide concentration of 2.5 microg m(-3) was recorded with a simultaneous peak of 168 microg m(-3) in the ozone concentration. From observations on the rate of decay in the measured concentrations, an evening-time deposition velocity of 0.28 cm s(-1) was derived for hydrogen peroxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modelling and Assessments Group, Environmental and Medical Sciences Division, Harwell Laboratory, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RA, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dollard", "ForeName": "G J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandalls", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derwent", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092426", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90059-6", "0269749189900596"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
