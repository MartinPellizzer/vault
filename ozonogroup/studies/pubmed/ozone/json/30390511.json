In this study, bench-, pilot-, and full-scale tests were conducted to focus on the occurrence and treatment of N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) in United States (U.S.) potable reuse systems. Out of twelve U.S. wastewater effluents collected, ambient NMOR was detected in eleven (average\u202f=\u202f20\u202f\u00b1\u202f18\u202fng/L); in contrast, only two of the thirteen surface water and stormwater samples had NMOR. Across all of these samples maximum formation potential by chloramination produced an average increase of 3.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.8\u202fng/L. This result underscores the need to understand the sources of NMOR as it is not likely a disinfection byproduct and it is not known to be commercially produced within the U.S. At the pilot-scale, three potable reuse systems were evaluated for ambient NMOR with oxidation (i.e., chlorination and ozonation), biofiltration, and granular activated carbon (GAC). Both pre-oxidation and biofiltration were ineffective at mitigating NMOR during long-term pilot plant operation (at least eight-months). GAC adsorbers were the only pilot-scale treatment to remove NMOR; however, complete breakthrough occurred rapidly from <2000 to 10,000 bed volumes. For comparison, a full-scale reverse osmosis (RO) potable reuse system was monitored for a year and confirmed that RO effectively removes NMOR. Systematic bench-scale UV-advanced oxidation experiments were undertaken to assess the mitigation potential for NMOR. At a fluence dose of 325\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fmJ/cm<sup>2</sup><sub>,</sub> UV alone degraded 90% of the NMOR present. The addition of 5\u202fmg/L hydrogen peroxide did not significantly decrease the UV dose required for one-log removal. These data illustrate that efficient NMOR removal from potable reuse systems is limited to RO or UV treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.
