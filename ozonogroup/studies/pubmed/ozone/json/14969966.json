However, little is known of the biochemical changes associated with this or other pollutants. Loblolly pine seedlings in open-top chambers were exposed to combinations of ozone (sub-ambient, ambient, or twice-ambient), acidic precipitation (pH 3.8 or pH 5.2) and soil magnesium (0.15 or 0.32 microg g(-1) exchangeable Mg) for three growing seasons. The effects of these treatments were greater in foliage than in stems or roots. The largest treatment effect was a 50% decrease in the starch concentration of current-year foliage from the twice-ambient ozone treatment compared with current-year foliage from the sub-ambient ozone treatment. Responses to ozone were consistent with the hypothesis that ozone-induced growth reductions are associated with depletion of carbohydrate reserves resulting from injury compensation and repair processes or reduced carbon fixation or both. Addition of acidic precipitation, and to a small extent Mg, decreased sugar concentrations of tissues; however, this effect appeared to be mediated by nutrient addition rather than by acidity per se. Given the role of carbohydrates in plant resistance to environmental stress, the sensitivity of carbohydrates to experimental treatments demonstrates the potential for indirect effects of ozone, acidic precipitation, and soil properties on stress resistance. Noncarbohydrate constituents were largely unresponsive to the experimental treatments. These findings imply that tissue carbohydrate analysis may be useful for assessing the impacts of pollutants in forest ecosystems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, Mississippi State University, P.O.
