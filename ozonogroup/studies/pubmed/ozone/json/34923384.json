To do this, different configurations of electrochemical reactors were tested for the disinfection of complex urines. Results showed that 4-6 logs bacterial removal were achieved for every bacterium tested when working with a microfluidic flow-through reactor after 180\u00a0min (0.423\u00a0Ah\u00a0dm<sup>-3</sup>). The MIKROZON\u00ae cell reached a total disinfection after 60\u00a0min (1.212\u00a0Ah\u00a0dm<sup>-3</sup>), causing severe damages induced in the cell walls observed in SEM images. The concentration profiles of the electrogenerated disinfectants in solution could explain the differences observed. Additionally, a mean decrease in the ARGs concentration ranked as follows: bla<sub>KPC</sub> (4.18-logs) >\u00a0bla<sub>TEM</sub> (3.96-logs) >\u00a0ermB (3.23-logs) using the MIKROZON\u00ae cell. This electro-ozonizer could be considered as a suitable alternative to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance spread. Hence, this study provides an insight into different electrochemical reactors for the disinfection of complex hospital urine matrices and contributes to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance through the elimination of ARGs. A topic of great importance nowadays that needs to be further studied."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
