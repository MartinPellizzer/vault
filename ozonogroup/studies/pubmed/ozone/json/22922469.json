Twelve age- and activity-matched, healthy, male lowlanders were examined at sea level and during acute hypoxia. We also measured fl ow-mediated dilatation (FMD), arterial stiffness defined by augmentation index normalized for a heart rate of 75 beats/min (AIx-75), and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).", "Compared with normoxic lowlanders, oxidative-nitrosative stress was moderately increased in the CMS 2 group ( P , .05), as indicated by elevated A \u2022- (3,191 457 arbitrary units [AU] vs 2,640 445 AU) and lower NO 2 2 (206 55 nM vs 420 128 nM), whereas vascular function remained preserved. This was comparable to that observed during acute hypoxia in lowlanders in whom vascular dysfunction is typically observed. In contrast, this response was markedly exaggerated in CMS 1 group (A \u2022- , 3,765 429 AU; NO 2 2 , 148 50 nM) compared with both the CMS 2 group and lowlanders ( P , .05). This was associated with systemic vascular dysfunction as indicated by lower ( P , .05 vs CMS 2 ) FMD (4.2% 0.7% vs 7.6% 1.7%) and increased AIx-75 (23% 8% vs 12% 7%) and carotid IMT (714 127 m M vs 588 94 m M).", "Healthy highlanders display a moderate, sustained elevation in oxidative-nitrosative stress that, unlike the equivalent increase evoked by acute hypoxia in healthy lowlanders, failed to affect vascular function. Its more marked elevation in patients with CMS may contribute to systemic vascular dysfunction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurovascular Research Laboratory, Faculty of Health, Science and Sport, University of Glamorgan, Wales; Sondes Mol\u00e9culaires en Biologie et Stress Oxydant, Institut de Chimie Radicalaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 7273, Aix-Marseille University, France.
