Specifically, evidence is presented for the formation, identification, and characterization of the long sought-after Criegee intermediate for each system, as well as the primary and secondary ozonides. These were observed after initial twin jet deposition and grew approximately 300% upon annealing to 35 K. Extensive isotopic labeling ((2)H, (18)O and mixtures) experiments provided important supporting data. Detailed theoretical calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,2p) and B3LYP/6-311++G(3df, 3pd) levels were carried out as well to augment the experimental work. Merged jet (flow reactor) experiments followed by cryogenic trapping in solid argon led to the formation of \"late\" stable oxidation products of cyclopentadiene and cyclopentene. In contrast, no thermal reaction between ozone and cyclopentane was observed. Photochemical reactions of ozone with all three organic substrates were studied as well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, P.O.
