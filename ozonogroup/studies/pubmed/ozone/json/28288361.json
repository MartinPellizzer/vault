Hence, in this study, we apply detrended cross-correlation analysis to investigate the multifractal properties between ozone and its precursors in a rural area in Hong Kong. The observed databases of ozone, NO<sub>2</sub>, NOx and CO levels during 2005-2014 are obtained from a rural monitoring station in Hong Kong. Based on the collected database, the cross-correlation analysis is carried out firstly to examine the cross-correlation patterns and the results indicate that close interactive relations exist between them. Then the detrended cross-correlation analysis is performed for further analysis. The multifractal characters occur between ozone and its precursors. The long-term cross-correlations behaviors in winter are verified to be stronger than that in other seasons. Additionally, the method is extended on daily averaged data to explore the multifractal property on various time scales. The long-term cross-correlation behavior of ozone vs NO<sub>2</sub> and NOx on daily basis becomes weaker while that of ozone vs CO becomes stronger. The multifractal properties for all pairs in summer are found to be the strongest among the whole year. These findings successfully illustrate that the multifractal analysis is a useful tool for describing the temporal scaling behaviors of ozone trends in different time series in rural areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
