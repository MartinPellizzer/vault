Daily erythemal doses in Brazil can be over 7,500 J m. Erythemal dose rates on cloudless days of winter and summer are typically about 0.147 W m and 0.332 W m, respectively. However, radiation enhancement events yielded by clouds have been reported with erythemal dose rates of 0.486 W m. Daily doses of the diffuse component of erythemal radiation have been determined with values of 5,053 J m and diffuse erythemal dose rates of 0.312 W m. Unfortunately, Brazilians still behave in ways that lead to overexposure to the sun. The annual personal ultraviolet radiation ambient dose among Brazilian youths can be about 5.3%. Skin cancer in Brazil is prevalent, with annual rates of 31.6% (non-melanoma) and 1.0% (melanoma). Governmental and non-governmental initiatives have been taken to increase public awareness of photoprotection behaviors. Resolution #56 by the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ria has banned tanning devices in Brazil. In addition, Projects of Law (PL), like PL 3730/2004, propose that the Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade should distribute sunscreen to members of the public, while PL 4027/2012 proposes that employers should provide outdoor workers with sunscreen during professional outdoor activities. Similar laws have already been passed in some municipalities. These are presented and discussed in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "*Instituto de Estudos Avan\u00e7ados (IEAv), Trevo Cel Av Jos\u00e9 Alberto Albano do Amarante 1, Putim, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, CEP 12.228-001, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Abel A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Health Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "2985093R", "ISSNLinking": "0017-9078"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Government Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Protection"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Radiodermatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Solar Energy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27115230", "10.1097/HP.0000000000000489", "00004032-201606000-00010"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
