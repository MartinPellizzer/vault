Hotter and drier climates lead to longer and more severe wildland fire seasons, impairing air quality around the globe. Hotter temperatures lead to higher amounts of ozone and particles, causing the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases and premature mortality. Longer pollen seasons and higher pollen concentrations provoke allergic airway diseases. In arid regions, accelerated land degradation and desertification are promoting dust pollution and impairing food production and nutritional content that are essential to respiratory health. Extreme weather events and flooding impede healthcare delivery and can lead to poor indoor air quality due to mold overgrowth. Climate and human activities that harm the environment and ecosystem may also affect the emergence and spread of viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and associated morbidity and mortality exacerbated by air pollution. Children and elderly individuals are more susceptible to the adverse health effects of climate change. Geographical and socioeconomic circumstances, together with a decreased capacity to adapt, collectively increase vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. Successful mitigation of anthropogenic climate change is dependent on the commitment of energy-intensive nations to manage greenhouse gas emissions, as well as societal support and response to aggravating factors. In this review, we focus on the respiratory health impacts of global climate change, with an emphasis on susceptible and vulnerable populations and low- and middle-income countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5236-766X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ko\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Bayram", "ForeName": "Hasan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2538-391X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}], "LastName": "Rice", "ForeName": "Mary B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado."}], "LastName": "Abdalati", "ForeName": "Waleed", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada."}], "LastName": "Akpinar Elci", "ForeName": "Muge", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Florida, Jacksonville, Florida."}], "LastName": "Mirsaeidi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INSERM, Montpellier, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Allergic and Respiratory Diseases, Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier, France."}], "LastName": "Annesi-Maesano", "ForeName": "Isabella", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9047-0353"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of California, Davis, Davis, California."}], "LastName": "Pinkerton", "ForeName": "Kent E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2246-7002"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California."}], "LastName": "Balmes", "ForeName": "John R", "Initials": "JR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "T42 OH008429", "Acronym": "OH", "Agency": "NIOSH CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P51 OD011107", "Acronym": "CD", "Agency": "ODCDC CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P30 ES023513", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Am Thorac Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "101600811", "ISSNLinking": "2325-6621"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vulnerable Populations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37126851", "10.1513/AnnalsATS.202212-996CME"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
