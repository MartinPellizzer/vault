Diesel-contaminated soils were ozonated for 0-900 min. PH and microbial concentrations in the soils decreased with increased ozonation time. The greatest reduction of total PH (TPH, 47.6%) and aromatics (11.3%) was observed in 900-min ozonated soil. The number of total viable heterotrophic bacteria decreased by three orders of magnitude in the soil. Ozonated soils were incubated for 9 weeks for bioremediation. The number of microorganisms in the soils increased during the incubation period, as monitored by culture- and nonculture-based methods. The soils showed additional PH-removal during incubation, supporting the presence of PH-degraders in the soils. The highest removal (25.4%) of TPH was observed during the incubation of 180-min ozonated soil during the incubation while a negligible removal was shown in 900-min ozonated soil. This negligible removal could be explained by the existence of relatively few or undetected PH-degraders in 900-min ozonated soil. After a 9-week incubation of the ozonated soils, 180-min ozonated soil showed the lowest TPH concentration, suggesting that appropriate ozonation and indigenous microorganisms survived ozonation could enhance remediation of PH-contaminated soil. Microbial community composition in 9-week incubated soils revealed a slight difference between 900-min ozonated and unozonated soils, as analyzed by whole cell hybridization. Taken together, this study provided insight into indigenous microbial potential to degrade PH in ozonated soils."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-701, Korea. yahn@kaist.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Yeonghee", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Haeryong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tatavarty", "ForeName": "Rameshwar", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Heechul", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ji-Won", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "In S", "Initials": "IS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biodegradation", "NlmUniqueID": "9100834", "ISSNLinking": "0923-9820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15727154", "10.1007/s10531-004-0428-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
