The major degradation products identified were tert-butyl formate (TBF), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), 2-methoxy-2-methyl propionaldehyde (MMP), acetone (AC), methyl acetate (MA), hydroxyisobutyraldehyde (HiBA), and formaldehyde (FA). The rate constants of the reaction of ozone and OH radicals with MTBE were found to be 0.14 and 1.9 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. The rate constants for the same oxidation processes were also measured for the degradation products TBF, MMP, MA, and HiBA (k(O3-TBF) = 0.78 M(-1) s(-1); k(OH-TBF) = 7.0 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1); k(O3-MMP) = 5 M(-1) s(-1); k(OH-MMP) = 3 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1), k(O3-MA) = 0.09 M(-1) s(-1), k(O3-HiBA) = 5 M(-1) s(-1); k(OH-HiBA) = 3 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1)). Since all compounds reacted slowly with molecular ozone, only the degradation pathway of MTBE with OH radicals has been determined, including the formation of primary degradation products. In experiments performed with several natural waters, the efficiency of MTBE elimination and the formation of bromate as disinfection byproduct have been measured. With a bromide level of 50 microg/L, only 35-50% of MTBE could be eliminated by the AOP O3/H2O2 without exceeding the current drinking water standard of bromate (10 microg/L). The transient concentrations of MTBE and its primary degradation products were modeled using a combination of kinetic parameters (degradation product distribution and rate constants) together with the ozone and OH radical concentration and were in good agreement with the experimental results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG), D\u00fcbendorf."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Acero", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haderlein", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suter", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29I4YB3S89", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl tert-butyl ether"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11718338", "10.1021/es010044n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
