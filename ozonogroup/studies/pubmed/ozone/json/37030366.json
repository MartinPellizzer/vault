The Fenwei Plain (FWP), one of the critical regions for China's \"Blue Sky Protection Campaign\", has reported severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution. This study investigates the spatiotemporal properties and the causes of O<sub>3</sub> pollution over the FWP using high-resolution data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) from 2019 to 2021. This study characterizes spatial and temporal variations in O<sub>3</sub> concentration by linking O<sub>3</sub> columns and surface monitoring using a trained deep forest machine learning model. O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in summer were 2-3 times higher than those found in winter due to higher temperatures and greater solar irradiation. The spatial distributions of O<sub>3</sub> correlate with the solar radiation showing decreased trends from the northeastern to the southwestern FWP, with the highest O<sub>3</sub> values in Shanxi Province and the lowest in Shaanxi Province. For urban areas, croplands and grasslands, the O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry in summer is NO<sub>x</sub>-limited or in the transitional regime, while it is VOC-limited in winter and other seasons. Reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions would be effective for decreasing O<sub>3</sub> levels in summer, while VOC reductions are necessary for winter. The annual cycle in vegetated areas included both NO<sub>x</sub>-limited and transitional regimes, indicating the importance of NO<sub>x</sub> controls to protect ecosystems. The O<sub>3</sub> response to limiting precursors shown here is of importance for optimizing control strategies and is illustrated by emission changes during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
