Though the importance of sulfide driven chemoautotrophic denitrification has been recognized, its contribution to N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in nature remains elusive. We built up long-term sulfide-added microcosms with sediments from two freshwater lakes. Chemistry analysis confirmed sulfide could drive nitrate respiration in long term. N<sub>2</sub>O accumulated to over 1.5% of nitrate load in both microcosms after long-term sulfide addition, which was up to 12.9 times higher than N<sub>2</sub>O accumulation without sulfide addition. Metagenomes were extracted and sequenced during microcosm incubations. 16\u00a0S rRNA genes of Thiobacillus and Defluviimonas were gradually enriched. The nitric oxide reductase with c-type cytochromes as electron donors (cNorB) increased in abundance, while the nitric oxide reductase receiving electrons from quinols (qNorB) decreased in abundance. cnorB genes similar to Thiobacillus were enriched in both microcosms. In parallel, enrichment was observed for enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation, which supplied electrons to nitrate respiration, and enzymes involved in Calvin Cycle, which sustained autotrophic cell growth, implying the coupling relationship between carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycling processes. Our results suggested sulfur pollution considerably increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in natural environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
