They used daily mortality and weather data for 6\u2009513\u2009330 deaths occurring during 1989-2000. Exposure was assessed using two approaches. First, the authors determined exposure to extreme temperatures using city-specific indicator variables based on the local temperature distribution. Secondly, they used piecewise linear variables to assess exposure to temperature on a continuous scale above/below a threshold. Effects of hot and cold temperature were examined in season-specific models. In a meta-analysis of the city-specific results, the authors examined several city characteristics as effect modifiers.", "Mortality increases associated with both extreme cold (2-day cumulative increase 1.59% (95% CI 0.56 to 2.63)) and extreme heat (5.74% (95% CI 3.38 to 8.15)) were found, the former being especially marked for myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest deaths. The increase in mortality was less marked at less extreme temperatures. The effect of extreme cold (defined as a percentile) was homogeneous across cities with different climates, suggesting that only the unusualness of the cold temperature (and not its absolute value) had a substantial impact on mortality (that is, acclimatisation to cold). Conversely, heat effects were quite heterogeneous, with the largest effects observed in cities with milder summers, less air conditioning and higher population density. Adjustment for ozone led to similar results, but some residual confounding could be present due to other uncontrolled pollutants.", "The authors confirmed in a large sample of cities that both cold and hot temperatures increase mortality risk. These findings suggest that increases in heat-related mortality due to global warming are unlikely to be compensated for by decreases in cold-related mortality and that population acclimatisation to heat is still incomplete."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02215, USA. mmedinar@hsph.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medina-Ram\u00f3n", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES000002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9422759", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acclimatization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Conditioning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cause of Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Arrest"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Density"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}], "CoiStatement": "Competing interests: None."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Patz J A, Engelberg D, Last J.
