BMAA is widely present in water sources contaminated by cyanobacteria and may threaten human health through drinking water. Although oxidants commonly used in drinking water plants such as chlorine, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals have been shown to effectively degrade BMAA, there are limited studies on the mechanism of BMAA degradation by different oxidants, especially ozone. This work systematically explored the effectiveness of BMAA ozonation degradation, investigated the effect of the operating parameters on the effectiveness of degradation, and speculated on the pathways of BMAA decomposition. The results showed that BMAA could be quickly eliminated by ozone, and the removal rates of BMAA were nearly 100% in pure water, but the removal rates were reduced in actual water. BMAA was primarily degraded by direct oxidation of ozone molecules in acidic and near-neutral conditions, and indirect oxidation of \u2022OH accounted for the main part under strong alkaline conditions. The pH value had a significant effect on the decomposition of BMAA, and the degradation rate of BMAA was fastest at near-neutral pH value. The degradation rates of TOC were significantly lower than that of BMAA, indicating that by-products were generated during the degradation process. Three by-products ([M-H]<sup>+</sup> \u2009=\u2009105, 90, and 88) were identified by UPLC-MS/MS, and the degradation pathways of BMAA were proposed. The production of by-products was attributed to the fracture of the C-N bonds. This work is helpful for the in-depth understanding on the mechanism and demonstration of the feasibility of the oxidation of BMAA by the ozone process. HIGHLIGHTS: \u2022 The reaction of ozonation BMAA was easy to occur. \u2022 The degradation rate was fast under near-neutral conditions. \u2022 Direct oxidation under neural conditions was the main pathway for ozone degradation of BMAA. \u2022 Three products were detected, and the reaction path was inferred."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
