MC-LR degradation was completed after 1\u00a0min under a pulsed high voltage of 16\u00a0kV, gas-liquid interface gap of 10\u00a0mm and oxygen flow rate of 160\u00a0L/h. The Box-Behnken Design was proposed in Response Surface Methodology to evaluate the influence of pulsed high voltage, electrode distance and oxygen flow rate on MC-LR removal efficiency. Multiple regression analysis, focused on multivariable factors, was employed and a reduced cubic model was developed. The ANOVA analysis shows that the model is significant and the model prediction on MC-LR removal was also validated with experimental data. The optimum conditions for the process are obtained at pulsed voltage of 16\u00a0kV, gas-liquid interface gap of 10\u00a0mm and oxygen flow rate of 120\u00a0L/h with ta removal efficiency of MC-LR of 96.6%. The addition of catalysts (TiO<sub>2</sub> or Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in the gas-liquid hybrid discharge system was found to enhance the removal of MC-LR. The intermediates of MC-LR degradation were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The degradation pathway proposed envisaged the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals and ozone, and attack of high-energy electrons on the unsaturated double bonds of Adda and Mdha, with MC-LR finally decomposing into small molecular products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
