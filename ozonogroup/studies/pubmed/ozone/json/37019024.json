High levels of ambient air pollution are known to have adverse health effects, but the relationship between exposure to air pollutants and migraine attack has not been established.", "This study aims to systematically review the effects of short-term exposure to fine and coarse particulate matter (PM), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide on migraine attack.", "The systematic review and meta-analysis will follow the WHO handbook for guideline development. Our protocol will comply with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and meta-Analysis Protocols.", "Original peer-reviewed studies conducted in the general population regardless of age and sex to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and migraine will be eligible for inclusion. Only time-series, case-crossover, and panel studies will be included.", "We will search the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Global Health, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature in accordance with the pre-established search strategy. We will also check the reference list of included papers and previous reviews for supplementary search.", "We will perform data extraction in accordance with the predesigned table. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we will present summary statistics (RRs and corresponding 95% CIs) associated with standardized increases in each pollutant level. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed using 80% prediction intervals (PI). Subgroup analyzes will be performed to explore sources of heterogeneity, if any. The main findings will be presented in summary of finding table, visual display and narrative synthesis. We will review the impact of each air pollutant exposure separately.", "We will employ the adaption of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations tool to assess the confidence in the body of evidence."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
