Acute frost injuries were compensated by increased leaf production. Early bud burst predisposed to frost damage, whereas late bud burst increased the vulnerability to ozone. In combined ozone + frost treatment, freezing reduced visible ozone injuries, counteracted ozone-induced growth enhancement and stomatal changes, and exacerbated ozone-caused reduction in palisade cell, chloroplast and starch grain size. Rapid changes in epidermal cell differentiation towards stomata and/or glandular trichomes occurred to enhance ozone/frost tolerance. \u2022 \u2002 The results showed large genetic variation within birch population in response to frost and ozone. Generally, birch seem to recover from acute frost occurrence efficiently through compensating leaf production, but co-occurring ozone enhancement may disturb the recovery processes mechanistically through structural damage in photosynthetic tissue, especially in chloroplasts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, Fin-70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prozherina", "ForeName": "Nadezhda", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, Fin-70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freiwald", "ForeName": "Vera", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Finnish Forest Research Institute, Punkaharju Research Station, Finlandiantie 18, FIN-58450 Punkaharju, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rousi", "ForeName": "Matti", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, Fin-70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oksanen", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Aroca R, Irigoyen JJ, Sanchez-Diaz M. 2001.
