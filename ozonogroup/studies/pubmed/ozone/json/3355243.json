Fifteen trained competitive cyclists participated in a randomized crossover study consisting of double-blinded inhalations of albuterol (180 micrograms) and placebo approximately 30 min prior to heavy continuous exercise (minute ventilation, [VE] greater than or equal to 80 L/min) for 60 min, followed by a maximal sprint (peak VE greater than 140 L/min) until exhaustion. Each subject was exposed randomly to either 0.21 ppm O3 or filtered air (FA) during the four single-blinded exposure sessions. Albuterol pretreatment resulted in modest but significant bronchodilation as compared to placebo. However, albuterol did not prevent O3-induced respiratory symptoms, decrements in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in one second (FEV1.0), and maximum midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75%), and positive histamine challenges as compared to that with placebo/O3. There were no statistically significant differences in the metabolic data or ride times across all drugs and exposures, although the peak VE was significantly lower with O3 than FA (142.3 vs. 150.7 L/min, respectively) regardless of drug. The results indicate that acute pretreatment with inhaled albuterol is unable to prevent or ameliorate O3-induced symptoms and alterations in pulmonary function and exercise performance. The contribution of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the acute airway responses to O3 appears to be minimal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, UCLA Medical Center."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bedi", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horvath", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QF8SVZ843E", "NameOfSubstance": "Albuterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Albuterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Constriction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Endurance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3355243", "10.1080/00039896.1988.9934373"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
