In the first experiment, adult males were exposed continuously to O3 at 0, 0.3, or 0.6 ppm for 30 days and their behavior was assessed in a 5-min open-field test on exposure days 4 and 19 and on day 3 after the end of the exposure phase. In addition, mice performed a Morris water maze task from exposure day 24 to 28. In the second experiment, adult females were exposed from 30 days prior to the formation of breeding pairs until gestational day 17 to the same doses used in the first experiment. Litters were fostered at birth to untreated dams and neurobehavioral development of the offspring was investigated until adulthood. Specifically, somatic and sensorimotor development [postnatal day (PND) 2-20], homing performance (PND 12), motor activity (PND 21), passive avoidance (PND 22-23), water maze performances (PND 70-74), and response to a nociceptive stimulus (PND 100) were assessed. Results from both experiments confirm that exposure to O3 slightly but selectively affected neurobehavioral performance in rodents. Exposure to O3 did not grossly affect neurobehavioral development, whereas it consistently impaired reversal learning in the Morris water maze test in both prenatally and adult exposed mice. Moreover, longer latency to step-through in the first trial of the passive avoidance test and a decrease in wall rearing in the hot-plate test were recorded in O3 prenatally exposed mice. Except for the first open-field test, altered responses were observed only in animals exposed at the intermediate concentration of the gas. Adaptation and/or onset of compensatory mechanisms might be responsible for the lack of linear dose-response relationships."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Behavioural Pathophysiology, Laboratorio di Fisiopatologia di Organo e di Sistema, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sorace", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Acetis", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alleva", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santucci", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Avoidance Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11161662", "10.1006/enrs.2000.4097", "S0013935100940970"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
