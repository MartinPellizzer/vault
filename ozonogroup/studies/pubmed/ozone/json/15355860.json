Chronic bronchitis and asthma, for example, heighten the risk of lung cancer. Exactly which inflammatory mediators (e.g., oxidant species and growth factors) and lung wound repair processes (e.g., proangiogenic factors) enhance pulmonary neoplastic development is not clear. One approach to uncover the most relevant biochemical and physiological pathways is to identify genes underlying susceptibilities to inflammation and to cancer development at the same anatomic site. Mice develop lung adenocarcinomas similar in histology, molecular characteristics, and histogenesis to this most common human lung cancer subtype. Over two dozen loci, called Pas or pulmonary adenoma susceptibility, Par or pulmonary adenoma resistance, and Sluc or susceptibility to lung cancer genes, regulate differential lung tumor susceptibility among inbred mouse strains as assigned by QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping. Chromosomal sites that determine responsiveness to proinflammatory pneumotoxicants such as ozone (O3), particulates, and hyperoxia have also been mapped in mice. For example, susceptibility QTLs have been identified on chromosomes 17 and 11 for O3-induced inflammation (Inf1, Inf2), O3-induced acute lung injury (Aliq3, Aliq1), and sulfate-associated particulates. Sites within the human and mouse genomes for asthma and COPD phenotypes have also been delineated. It is of great interest that several susceptibility loci for mouse lung neoplasia also contain susceptibility genes for toxicant-induced lung injury and inflammation and are homologous to several human asthma loci. These QTLs are described herein, candidate genes are suggested within these sites, and experimental evidence that inflammation enhances lung tumor development is provided."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Respiratory Biology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA. bauer1@niehs.nih.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bauer", "ForeName": "Alison K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malkinson", "ForeName": "Alvin M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleeberger", "ForeName": "Steven R", "Initials": "SR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-33497", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA-96133", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-57142", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-66109", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100901229", "ISSNLinking": "1040-0605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "NumberOfReferences": "254"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15355860", "10.1152/ajplung.00223.2003", "287/4/L685"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
