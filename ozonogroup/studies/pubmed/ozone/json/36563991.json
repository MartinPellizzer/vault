Carbonyls were sampled using an automatic carbonyl sampler in August 2019 to determine their pollution characteristics and sources. An average concentration of ten carbonyls was 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> detected using an HPLC-UV system. The concentrations of most detected carbonyls in August were significantly higher than those in the winter months in China. Acetone, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the most abundant species, accounting for 73% of all detected carbonyls. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and methacrolein (MACR) were the most significant contributors to OH\u2022 reactivity and ozone generation, indicating that these three carbonyls were the key species influencing the production of O<sub>3</sub>. The concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and MACR showed similar diurnal variations on most days, with high values during the daytime reaching a peak at 10:00. However, the concentrations of the latter two species varied less than that of formaldehyde during the day. The acetone concentration generally increased continuously from morning to night, with the maximum value around 22:00. The C1/C2 ratio in summer was higher than that in winter. These results indicated that the carbonyls in Linfen were not only affected by anthropogenic sources such as vehicle exhaust but also by secondary photochemical production. The results of formaldehyde source apportionment showed that the contributions of background, primary, and secondary sources to the observed formaldehyde concentration were 27.6%, 36.6%, and 35.8%, respectively. Additionally, this study revealed for the first time that the vertical transport of air masses containing high concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub> radicals above the boundary layer could increase the secondary generation of formaldehyde at night in summer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
