The catalyst was characterized using XRD, surface area measurements, and temperature-programmed desorption of methanol. The oxidation of methanol with ozone in the absence of a catalyst gave about 30% conversion at 100 degrees C. Methanol oxidation over a V2O5/TiO2 catalyst at 100 degrees C gave very little conversion with oxygen, whereas the conversion increased to 80% with ozone. Methanol, having an inlet stream concentration of 15 000 ppmv, can be completely oxidized to CO(x) with an ozone-to-methanol ratio of 1.2, a temperature of 150 degrees C, and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 60 000 h(-1). The apparent activation energy with ozone was calculated to be ca. 40 kJ/mol, which is much lower than that calculated with oxygen (60 kJ/mol). At low methanol conversion methyl formate was the main product, whereas higher conversions favored oxidation to CO(x). The results imply a consecutive reaction of adsorbed methanol species, favoring selectivity toward methyl formate at lower temperatures and ozone-to-methanol ratios and CO(x) at higher temperatures and ozone-to-methanol ratios. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics was used to model the reaction with and without ozone in the feed. The model parameters were obtained using least-squares fit to a selected set of experimental data, and the model was subsequently compared to all experimental data obtained in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Paper Science and Chemical Engineering Department, Miami University, 246 Gaskill Hall, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Almquist", "ForeName": "Catherine B", "Initials": "CB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sahle-Demessie", "ForeName": "Endalkachew", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sehker", "ForeName": "K Sridara Chandra", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sowash", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00J9J9XKDE", "NameOfSubstance": "Vanadium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vanadium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17695925", "10.1021/es062518u"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
