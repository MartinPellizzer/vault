The O(3) dose was normalized based upon total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrite to allow comparison between the different wastewaters with respect to O(3) decomposition. EfOM with higher molecular weight components underwent greater transformation, which corresponded to increased O(3) decomposition when compared on a TOC basis. Hydroxyl radical (()OH) exposure, measured by parachlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), showed that limited ()OH was available for contaminant destruction during the initial stage of O(3) decomposition (t<30s) due to the effect of the scavenging by the water quality. Advanced oxidation using O(3) and hydrogen peroxide did not increase the net production of ()OH compared to O(3) under the conditions studied. EfOM reactivity impacted the removal of trace contaminants when evaluated based on the O(3):TOC ratio. Trace contaminants with second order reaction rate constants with O(3)(k(O)(3))>10(5)M(-1)s(-1) and ()OH (k(OH))>10(9)M(-1)s(-1), including carbamazepine, diclofenac, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan, were >95% removed independent of water quality when the O(3) exposure (integralO(3)t) was measurable (0-0.8mgmin/L). O(3) exposure would be a conservative surrogate to assess the removal of trace contaminants that are fast-reacting with O(3). Removal of contaminants with k(O)(3) < 10M(-1)S(-1) , and k(OH)>10(9)M(-1)s(-1), including atrazine, iopromide, diazepam, and ibuprofen, varied when O(3) exposure could not be measured, and appeared to be dependent upon the compound specific k(OH). Atrazine, diazepam, ibuprofen and iopromide provided excellent linear correlation with pCBA (R(2)>0.86) making them good indicators of ()OH availability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA), P.O.
