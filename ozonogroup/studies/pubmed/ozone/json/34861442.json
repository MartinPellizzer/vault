Inverse distance weighting method was used to assess daily individual-level exposures to ambient air pollutants including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u2264\u00a010\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Conditional logistic regression model was applied to analyze the associations between ambient air pollutants and COPD hospitalization.", "TYAP can modify the associations.
