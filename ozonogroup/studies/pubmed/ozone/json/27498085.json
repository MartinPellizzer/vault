They were randomly allocated into 2 groups (n=13 for each group). In group 1 (test group); the participants' upper anterior teeth were treated with 38% H2O2 for 20min then the teeth were exposed to ozone for 60s (healOzone(\u00ae) X4, KaVo Dental, Biberach, Germany). In group 2 (controls); the upper anterior teeth were treated with 20min of 38% H2O2 only. The shade of teeth was evaluated by recording the L* a* b* values and Vita Classic shades at study baseline and after bleaching in both groups. The statistically significant changes were set at P\u22640.05.", "Tooth sensitivity and teeth shades were comparable between groups at study baseline (p>0.05). Controls reported more tooth sensitivity following bleaching (p<0.001). Teeth achieved better Vita shades, higher L* values (lighter shades), and lower a* and b* values (lighter shades) after bleaching in both groups (P\u22640.05). However, teeth bleached with H2O2 and ozone achieved better Vita shades, higher L* values and lower a* values (lighter shades) than those bleached with H2O2 alone (p<0.001). Changes in b* values were not significantly different between groups.", "Bleaching with 38% H2O2 for 20min followed by 60s of ozone application would result in teeth with lighter shades than bleaching with 38% H2O2 alone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
