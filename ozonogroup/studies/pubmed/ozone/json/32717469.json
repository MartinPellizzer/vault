However, there are few studies referring to the formation of DBPs and DBPs-associated toxicity under various disinfection methods based on microorganisms in the real WDS. In addition, the main contributors of bacterial communities or components that generate DBPs are unclear. In this study, the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs), halo-acetic acids (HAAs), nitrosamines (NAs) from culturable microorganisms in pipeline network by ozonation(O<sub>3</sub>), chlorination (Cl<sub>2</sub>), chloramination (NH<sub>2</sub>Cl) and joint disinfection methods were compared, meanwhile, their calculated toxicities under different oxidation scenarios were also discussed. Moreover, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing was used to identify the main microbial communities. The results demonstrated that THMs and HAAs increased with increasing disinfectant dosages, while the quantity of NAs (mainly nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA)) was not significantly related to disinfectant dosages for each disinfection strategy. Chloroform (TCM) and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) were the dominant THMs and HAAs species, respectively. NDMA existed in the samples before disinfections, which may due to the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Pre-O<sub>3</sub> increased THMs formation during subsequent Cl<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub>Cl treatment. However, pre-O<sub>3</sub> effectively reduced HAAs produced by subsequent chlorination. O<sub>3</sub>/Cl<sub>2</sub> disinfection had the highest DBPs formation potential (DBPFP) (883.6\u00a0nM), while its calculated toxicity was similar to that in Cl<sub>2</sub> disinfection treatment. Pseudomonas was the most abundant bacterial genus in biofilm of WDS pipeline. This study can aid in an optimal disinfection strategy for water treatment plants to reduce the toxicity of DBPs caused by biomass in pipelines and ensure water quality safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
