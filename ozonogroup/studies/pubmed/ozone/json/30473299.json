Observation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> with high temporal resolution was conducted in Chengdu to investigate the chemical processes and causes of high O<sub>3</sub> levels. The hourly mixing ratios of VOCs, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> were monitored by an online system from 28 August to 7 October, 2016. According to meteorological conditions, Chengdu, with relative warm weather and low wind speed, is favorable to O<sub>3</sub> formation. Part of the O<sub>3</sub> in Chengdu may be transported from the downtown area. In O<sub>3</sub> episodes, the average mixing ratios of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were 20.20\u202fppbv and 47.95\u202fppbv, respectively. In non-O<sub>3</sub> episodes, the average mixing ratios of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were 16.38\u202fppbv and 35.15\u202fppbv, respectively. The average mixing ratio of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 40.29\u202fppbv in non-O<sub>3</sub> episodes, which was lower than that in O<sub>3</sub> episodes (53.19\u202fppbv). Alkenes comprised 51.7% of the total O<sub>3</sub> formation potential (OFP) in Chengdu, followed by aromatics which accounted for 24.2%. Ethylene, trans-pentene, propene, and BTEX (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene) were also major contributors to the OFP in Chengdu. In O<sub>3</sub> episodes, intensive secondary formations were observed during the campaign. Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), such as acetone, Methylethylketone (MEK), and Methylvinylketone (MVK) were abundant. Isoprene rapidly converted to MVK and Methacrolein (MACR) during O<sub>3</sub> episodes. Acetone was mainly the oxidant of C3-C5 hydrocarbons."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
