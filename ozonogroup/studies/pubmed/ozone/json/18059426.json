Scripts prescribed the time, location, duration and nature of activities intended to simulate daily activity patterns for adults and children. Scripts were paired such that one individual would proceed with usual activities (base scenario), whereas the other (intervention scenario) would alter activities as if following advice. Other than commuting, where the intervention group walked or used public transportation rather than riding in personal vehicles, this group generally spent less time outdoors. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs), particulate matter of median aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mum (PM(2.5)) and total volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured using samplers carried by individuals during the course of daily activities. During daytime activities (e.g., work, daycare) constituting the largest share of sampling time (approximately 6 h per day), the intervention group experienced a 14% reduction in exposure to UFPs (P=0.01), a 21% reduction in exposure to PM(2.5) (P=0.08), and an 86% increase in exposure to VOCs (P=0.02). Other findings included an 89% increase in exposure to UFPs (P=0.02) and a threefold increase in exposure to VOCs (P=0.08) in the intervention group during evening cooking. Following smog advisory advice results in reduced exposures to some pollutants, while at the same time increasing exposure to others. Advice needs to be refined giving consideration to overall personal exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ealthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. dave_stieb@hc-sc.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stieb", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Gregory J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sabaliauskas", "ForeName": "Kelly", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "Monica E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wheeler", "ForeName": "Amanda J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brook", "ForeName": "Jeffrey R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guay", "ForeName": "Mireille", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101262796", "ISSNLinking": "1559-0631"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Health Promotion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ontario"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18059426", "10.1038/sj.jes.7500634", "7500634"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
