To valorize unused resources, coconut shell, recovered and recycled from agricultural waste, was converted into activated carbon, which can be used for leachate treatment. The ozonation of the CSWAC was conducted to enhance its removal performance for target pollutants. The adsorption mechanisms of refractory pollutants by the adsorbent are proposed. Perspectives on nutrient recovery technologies from landfill leachate from the view-points of downstream processing are presented. Their removal efficiencies for both recalcitrant compounds and ammoniacal nitrogen were compared to those of other techniques reported in previous work. It is found that the ozonated CSWAC substantially removed COD (i.e. 76%) as well as NH<sub>3</sub>-N (i.e. 75%), as compared to the CSWAC without pretreatment (i.e. COD: 44%; NH<sub>3</sub>-N: 51%) with NH<sub>3</sub>-N and COD concentrations of 2750 and 8500\u00a0mg/L, respectively. This reveals the need of ozonation for the adsorbent to improve its performance for the removal of COD and NH<sub>3</sub>-N at optimized reactions: 30\u00a0g/L of CSWAC, pH 8, 200\u00a0rpm of shaking speed and 20\u00a0min of reaction time. Nevertheless, treatment of the leachate samples using the ozonated CSWAC alone was still unable to result in treated effluents that could meet the COD and NH<sub>3</sub>-N discharge standards below 200 and 5\u00a0mg/L, respectively, set by legislative requirements. This reveals that another treatment is necessary to be undertaken to comply with the requirement of their effluent limit."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
