Herein, we report a new case of 1-bromopropane-induced neurotoxicity. A 43-year-old male industrial worker developed muscle weakness, pain, numbness, and gait disturbance. Neurological examination indicated sensory ataxic neuropathy associated with mild impairment of upper motor neurons. He had used 1-bromopropane as a cleaning agent for metal parts at his workplace without appropriate protection. The serum bromide level was elevated at the onset of clinical manifestations. Histopathologic examination of sural nerve biopsy showed axonal damage. Under the tentative diagnosis of 1-bromopropane toxicity, he was kept away from exposure to the solvent. This resulted in gradual improvement of symptoms, recovery of motor function, and resolution of sensory deficits. The diagnosis of 1-bromopropane neurotoxicity in this case was based on details of the work environment, the clinical course, and laboratory and pathologic findings. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes nerve biopsy findings in a human case."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. daruma@med.kindai.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samukawa", "ForeName": "Makoto", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ichihara", "ForeName": "Gaku", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oka", "ForeName": "Nobuyuki", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kusunoki", "ForeName": "Susumu", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Intern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0372440", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9926"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9746DNE68", "NameOfSubstance": "1-bromopropane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gait Disorders, Neurologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypesthesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Weakness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurologic Examination"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxicity Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recovery of Function"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Sural Nerve"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22893012", "10.1001/archinternmed.2012.3987", "1309581"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
