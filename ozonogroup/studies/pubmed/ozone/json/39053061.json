This work reported M-NC (M=Co, Ni, Fe, and Mn) single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high atomic efficiency and minimal metal release. The new HCO systems, especially the Co-based system, exhibited impressive performance in various refractory contaminant removal, involving various reactive species generation, such as \u2022OH<sub>ads</sub>, \u2022OH<sub>free</sub>, *O, and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. For sulfamethoxazole removal, the normalized k<sub>obs</sub> for Co-NC, Ni-NC, Fe-NC, and Mn-NC were determined as 13.53, 3.94, 3.55, and 4.13\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7mM<sub>metal</sub><sup>-1</sup>\u00b7g\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> correspondingly, attributed to the abundant acid sites, faster electron transfer, and lower energy required for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition and conversion. The metal atoms and hydroxyl groups, individually serving as Lewis and Bronsted acid sites (LAS and BAS), were the primary centers for \u2022OH generation and O<sub>3</sub> adsorption. The relationships between active sites and both O<sub>3</sub> utilization and \u2022OH generation were found. LAS and BAS were responsible for O<sub>3</sub> adsorption, while strong LAS facilitated O<sub>3</sub> conversion into \u2022OH. Theoretical calculations revealed the catalytic mechanisms involved O<sub>3</sub>\u2192 *O\u2192 *OO\u2192 O<sub>3</sub>\u2022<sup>-</sup>\u2192 \u2022OH.
