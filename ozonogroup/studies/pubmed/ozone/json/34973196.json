Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is one of the known BFR used many in industries today. Due to its wide application as an additive flame retardant in commodities, TBBPA has become a common indoor contaminant. Recent researches have raised concerns about the possible hazardous effect of exposure to TBBPA and its derivatives in humans and wildlife. This review gives a thorough assessment of the literature on TBBPA and its derivatives, as well as environmental levels and human exposure. Several analytical techniques/methods have been developed for sensitive and accurate analysis of TBBPA and its derivatives in different compartments. These chemicals have been detected in practically every environmental compartment globally, making them a ubiquitous pollutant. TBBPA may be subject to adsorption, biological degradation or photolysis, photolysis after being released into the environment. Treatment of TBBPA-containing waste, as well as manufacturing and usage regulations, can limit the release of these chemicals to the environment and the health hazards associated with its exposure. Several methods have been successfully employed for the treatment of TBBPA including but not limited to adsorption, ozonation, oxidation and anaerobic degradation. Previous studies have shown that TBBPA and its derivative cause a lot of toxic effects. Diet and dust ingestion and have been identified as the main routes of TBBPA exposure in the general population, according to human exposure studies. Toddlers are more vulnerable than adults to be exposed to indoor dust through inadvertent ingestion. Furthermore, TBBP-A exposure can occur during pregnancy and through breast milk. This review will go a long way in closing up the knowledge gap on the silent and over ignored deadly effects of TBBPA and its derivatives and their attendant consequences."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
