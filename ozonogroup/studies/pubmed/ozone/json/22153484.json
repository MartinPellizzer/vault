Transformations of effluent organic matter (EfOM) caused by ozonation were characterized using absorbance/fluorescence spectroscopy and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Concentrations of aldehydes and carboxylic acids generated via the oxidation of EfOM were also determined. The absorbance and fluorescence of ozonated wastewater decreased with increasing ozone dose or treatment time. HPSEC data showed that these phenomena corresponded to the oxidation of all EfOM fractions, with some preference towards the degradation of the EfOM molecules with high apparent molecular weight. The removal of antibiotics and production of aldehydes and carboxylic acids were strongly correlated with the changes in both EfOM absorbance and fluorescence. Applications of a model describing the concurrent degradation of trace level contaminants and relative changes of EfOM emission allowed achieving a good fitting between the experimental and modeled \u0394C/C(0) vs. \u0394A/A(0) and \u0394C/C(0) vs. \u0394F/F(0) data."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
