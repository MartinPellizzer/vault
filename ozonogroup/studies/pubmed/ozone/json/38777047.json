The Ocular Surface Disease Index-6 (OSDI-6) questionnaire was used to assess the presence of DES. Logistic regression models were employed to analyze the associations between DES and air pollution variables, including air quality index (AQI), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), PM<sub>10</sub>, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and residing near industrial zones. We explored the interactions of air pollutants and other risk factors in the additive models by calculating the synergy index (SI). Standardized regression coefficients were calculated to compare the relative importance of risk factors for DES.", "A total of 21,909 participants were included in the analysis. Residing near industrial zones was significantly correlated with a higher risk of DES (Odds ratio (OR): 1.57, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-1.79). No significant associations were found between DES and air pollutants except SO<sub>2</sub> (OR: 1.05, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.02-1.09, per standard deviation increment in SO<sub>2</sub> concentration). The restricted cubic spline analyses revealed a linear concentration-response relationship between SO<sub>2</sub> and DES. The interaction analyses suggested synergetic interactions of SO<sub>2</sub> with depression and problematic internet use. Among the risk factors, depression, anxiety and problematic Internet use contributed more to the increased risk of DES.", "The association between ambient air pollutants and DES may have been mitigated during the pandemic due to increased time spent indoors. Despite this, our findings support the deleterious health impact of air pollutants. Future urban planning should plan industrial zones further away from residential areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
