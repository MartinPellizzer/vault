However, their associations with air pollutant exposure have not been consistent across studies. We hypothesize that the inconsistency is partly due to confounding of circulating melatonin. We analyzed urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), a surrogate of circulating melatonin, along with 8-OHdG and MDA, in 159 healthy adults who had not taken melatonin supplementation. Within the natural range of endogenously-generated aMT6s (0.3-93.5\u202fng/mg creatinine) measured in this study, increasing aMT6s levels were significantly associated with increasing concentrations of 8-OHdG and MDA. Measurements of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), coupled with time-activity data, were used to calculate time-averaged personal exposures 12\u202f-hour (12h) and 24-hour (24h) prior to urine collection. Without controlling for aMT6s, the relationships between pollutant exposure and 8-OHdG or MDA were not clear. After controlling for aMT6s, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 12h PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 12h NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was associated with 6.1% [95%CI: 1.6%-10.8%] and 8.6% [1.3%-16.5%] increase in MDA, respectively. An IQR increase in 12h O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated with a 5.7% [1.9%-9.7%] in 8-OHdG. The findings suggest the need for controlling for aMT6s as a confounder in using urinary 8-OHdG and MDA as biomarkers of oxidative stress related to short-term air pollution exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
