We investigated reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced secretion and catabolism of ascorbate. *Late-growth-phase cultured cells of rose and Arabidopsis were preloaded with [(14)C]ascorbate. Radiolabelled metabolites and secretion products were analysed by high-voltage electrophoresis. *In both species, exogenous 1 mM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) rapidly stimulated [(14)C]ascorbate and [(14)C]dehydroascorbate accumulation in the medium (apoplast). Net (14)C export was most rapid within 100 s of washing, and often showed superimposed pulses, of c. 10-s duration, whose amplitude was greater after H(2)O(2) treatment. Oxidative stress did not cause indiscriminate metabolite leakage from the cells. H(2)O(2) caused c. 20-40% of the intracellular [(14)C]ascorbate to be irreversibly catabolized to [(14)C]oxalyl-threonate and related products; however, the great majority of the extracellular radioactivity remained as [(14)C]ascorbate and [(14)C]dehydroascorbate. Much of the apoplastic dehydroascorbate was probably reabsorbed by the cells and reduced back to ascorbate. *The data show that exported ascorbate can serve an apoplastic antioxidant role in these late-growth-phase cells without being irreversibly lost, whereas in early-growth-phase cells most extracellular ascorbate is irreversibly degraded. In conclusion, cultured plant cells can respond actively to oxidative stress by reversibly exporting ascorbate into the apoplast."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Edinburgh Cell Wall Group, Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, The King's Buildings, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parsons", "ForeName": "Harriet T", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Edinburgh Cell Wall Group, Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, The King's Buildings, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fry", "ForeName": "Stephen C", "Initials": "SC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "D19626", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30237-26-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Space"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Asada K. 1999.
