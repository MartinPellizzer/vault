However, the efforts throughout most of the world have been aimed at dealing with these two problems separately for too many years. In fact, it is very often believed that the climate's health-safeguarding benefits would be achieved in the long term. To the contrary, what has become obvious over recent years is that the actions for reducing the emissions of polluting gases could redound in beneficial effects in the short term due to the reduction of the impact of air pollutants on the health of our citizens. This article presents the possible risks of the pollutants most closely related to climate changes, such as ozone and fine particles. Bearing in mind the uncertainties and unknowns related to this subject, the main implications for the policies related to this matter in Spain, as well as the needs for research are set out herein. In this regard, both from the standpoint of monitoring as well as research, it is considered necessary for an epidemiological monitoring system of the effects of air pollution and the relationship thereof to global changes to be established."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unidad de Epidemiologia y Estad\u00edstica, Escuela Valenciana de Estudios para la Salud. ballester_fer@gva.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ballester", "ForeName": "Ferran", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Contaminaci\u00f3n atmosf\u00e9rica, cambio clim\u00e1tico y salud."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Rev Esp Salud Publica", "NlmUniqueID": "9600212", "ISSNLinking": "1135-5727"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}], "NumberOfReferences": "53"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15913052", "10.1590/s1135-57272005000200005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
