However, in recent decades, EtO has been recognized as a potential mutagenic, reproductive, neurologic, and fire and explosion hazard to workers, and one agency has reportedly voted to classify EtO as carcinogenic to humans. Strict regulations concerning EtO exposure have been imposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the use of EtO, along with other toxic pollutants, is also being monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act. In addition, the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as EtO diluents has focused attention on the EtO-CFC mixtures used in many sterilizers because CFCs have been linked to destruction of the ozone layer. Concerns about restrictive regulations related to these issues have prompted many hospitals to examine their use of EtO sterilization and propagated the misinformation that EtO sterilization is being phased out. In this article, we address some commonly asked questions regarding the use and regulation of EtO mixtures, as well as alternative sterilization agents and methods; provide two case studies illustrating how hospitals can evaluate various sterilization options; and summarize our conclusions and recommendations for hospitals facing decisions about sterilization techniques. For related topics, also see our Evaluation Update on endoscope reprocessors and our Hazard Report on improperly connected EtO-CFC cylinders to EtO sterilizers in this issue."]}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Health Devices", "NlmUniqueID": "1262063", "ISSNLinking": "0046-7022"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JJH7GNN18P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Central Supply, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decision Making"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Directories as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Equipment and Supplies, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Purchasing, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "legislation & jurisprudence", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7896559"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
