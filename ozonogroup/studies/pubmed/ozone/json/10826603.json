All the polyoxides investigated were characterized for the first time by 17O NMR spectroscopy of highly 17O-enriched species. The assignment was confirmed by GIAO/MP2/6-31++G* calculations of 17O NMR chemical shifts, which were in excellent agreement with the experimental values. Ab initio density functional (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/ 6-31G*+ZPE level have clarified the transition structure (TS1, deltaE = 7.4 and 10.6 kcalmol(-1), relative to isolated reactants and the complex 1a-ozone, respectively) for the ozonation of 1a: this, together with the formation of HOOOH and some other products, indicates the involvement of radical intermediates (R*, *OOOH) in the reaction. The activation parameters for the decomposition of the hydrotrioxides 2a and 2b (Ea, = 23.5+/-1.5 kcalmol(-1), logA = 16+/-1.8) were typical for a homolytic process in which cleavage of the ROOOH molecule occurs to yield a radical pair [RO* *OOH] and represents the lowest available energy pathway. Significantly the lower activation parameters for the decomposition of HOOOH (Ea = 16.5+/-2.2 kcalmol(-1), logA = 9.5+/-2.0) relative to those expected for the homolytic scission of the HO-OOH bond [bond dissociation energy (BDE) = 29.8 kcalmol(-1), CCSD(T)/6-311++G**] are in accord with the proposal that water behaves as a bifunctional catalyst and therefore participates in a \"polar\" (non-radical) decomposition process of this polyoxide. A relatively large acceleration of the decomposition of the hydrotrioxide 2a in [D6]acetone, accompanied by a significant lowering of the activation energies, was observed in the presence of a large excess of water. Thus intramolecular 1,3-proton transfer probably also involves the participation of water and is similar to the mechanism proposed for the decomposition of HOOOH. This hypothesis was further substantiated by the B3LYP/6-31++ G*+ZPE calculations for the participation of water in the decomposition of CH3OOOH, which revealed two stationary points on the potential energy surface corresponding to a CH3OOOH-HOH complex and a six-membered cyclic transition state TS2. The energy barriers were comparable with those calculated for HOOOH, that is, deltaE = 15.0 and 21.5 kcalmol(-1) relative to isolated reactants and the CH3OOOH-HOH complex, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. bozo.plesnicar@uni-lj.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plesnicar", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cerkovnik", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tekavec", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koller", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Chemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "9513783", "ISSNLinking": "0947-6539"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10826603", "10.1002/(sici)1521-3765(20000303)6:5<809::aid-chem809>3.0.co;2-8", "10.1002/(SICI)1521-3765(20000303)6:5<809::AID-CHEM809>3.0.CO;2-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
