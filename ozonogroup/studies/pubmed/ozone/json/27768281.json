In situ measurements of the chlorine monoxide radical, ClO, and its precursor, Cl<sub>2</sub>, along with BrO and Br<sub>2</sub>, were conducted using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) during the Bromine, Ozone, and Mercury Experiment (BROMEX) near Barrow, Alaska, in March 2012. To our knowledge, these data represent the first ClO measurements made using CIMS. A maximum daytime ClO concentration of 28 ppt was observed following an early morning peak of 75 ppt of Cl<sub>2</sub>. A zero-dimensional photochemistry model was constrained to Cl<sub>2</sub> observations and used to simulate ClO during a 7-day period of the field campaign. The model simulates ClO within the measurement uncertainty, and the model results highlight the importance of chlorine chemistry participation in bromine radical cycling, as well as the dependence of halogen chemistry on NO<sub>x</sub> levels. The ClO measurements and simulations are consistent with Cl<sub>2</sub> being the dominant Cl atom source in the Arctic boundary layer. Simulated Cl atom concentrations, up to \u223c1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>, highlight the importance of chlorine chemistry in the degradation of volatile organic compounds, including the greenhouse gas methane."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University , West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States."}], "LastName": "Custard", "ForeName": "Kyle D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University , West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States."}], "LastName": "Pratt", "ForeName": "Kerri A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Siyuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University , West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences and Purdue Climate Change Research Center, Purdue University , West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States."}], "LastName": "Shepson", "ForeName": "Paul B", "Initials": "PB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Halogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Halogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27768281", "10.1021/acs.est.6b03909"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
