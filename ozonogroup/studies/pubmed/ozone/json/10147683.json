The replacement of these propellants by other fluorinated ones will be possible as soon as their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated. Other substitution substances like haliphatic hydrocarbons (butane, propane) or compressed air generated by the device system itself or the user himself are also under development. The pulverisation can also be obtained by the pressure of a classical propellant onto an aluminum or plastic bag. The dispersion is achieved by means of a regulator which is positioned into the valve. The hand-operated spray pumps with or without compression will also allow the obtention of very small particles though the delivered doses are reduced. However, as few of the new devices have metered valves, they are not yet suitable for pulmonary administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Biopharmaceutics Department, Clermont-Ferrand, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aiache", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Aerosol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8809251", "ISSNLinking": "0894-2684"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosol Propellants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosol Propellants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nebulizers and Vaporizers"}], "NumberOfReferences": "8"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10147683", "10.1089/jam.1991.4.323"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
