Comparing the different scenarios, we found that (1) vehicle control policies will bring significant reductions in the emissions of primary pollutants. Among the individual policies, upgrading new vehicle emission standards and fuel quality in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei will be the most effective policy, with emission reductions of primary pollutants of 26.3%-54.7%, 38.0%-70.3% and 46.0%-81.6% in 2025, respectively; (2) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> in winter, the Combined Scenario (CS) will lead to a reduction of 0.5-3.9\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> (3.5%-11.6%) for the monthly average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in most areas. The monthly nitrate and ammonium concentrations would reduce by 5.8% and 5.3%, respectively, in the whole BTH region, indicating that vehicle emission control policies may play an important role in the reduction of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in winter, especially for nitrate aerosols; and (3) for O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in summer, vehicle emission control policies will lead to significant decreases. Under the CS scenario, the maximum reduction of monthly average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the summer is approximately 3.6\u202fppb (5.9%). Most areas in the BTH region have a decrease of 15\u202fppb (7.5%) in peak values compared to the base scenario. However, in some VOC-sensitive areas in the BTH region, such as the southern urban areas, significant reductions in NO<sub>x</sub> may lead to increases in ozone concentrations. Our results highlight that season- and location-specific vehicle emission control measures are needed to alleviate ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution effectively in this region due to the complex meteorological conditions and atmospheric chemical reactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
