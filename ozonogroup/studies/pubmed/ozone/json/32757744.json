The investigation sought to determine whether there is an association between short-term ambient ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) level exposure and daily hospital admissions for depression in Taipei from 2009 to 2013 using a time-stratified case-crossover design. In our single-pollutant model (with no adjustment for other pollutants), the % increase in daily hospital admissions for depression was 12% on warm days and 30% on cool days, per interquartile range (IQR) rise in O<sub>3</sub> levels, respectively. Ozone levels were significantly correlated with daily number of depression admissions both on warm and cool days. In our two-pollutant models, O<sub>3</sub> levels remained significant after adjusting for other air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) both on warm and cool days. Although O<sub>3</sub> levels tended to be higher on warm days, admissions for depression were higher on cool days, suggesting that the relationship between O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and depression may be affected by temperature. Further study is needed to better understand these findings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Healthcare Administration, I-Shou University , Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Shang-Shyue", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Global Health and Development, College of Public Health, Taipei Medical University , Taipei, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Ya-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine , Taipei, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Yi-Hao", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Health Research Institute , Miaoli, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32757744", "10.1080/15287394.2020.1801544"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
