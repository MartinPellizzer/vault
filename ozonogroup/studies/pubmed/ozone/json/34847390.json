In this study, two chemical oxidation procedures were developed: continuous ozonation at pH 7.0 and free available chlorine (FAC) titrations at pH 9.2. The formation of two oxidation products (nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and chloramines, respectively) was used to quantify and characterize oxidant-reactive nitrogenous moieties in DON. In addition, batch experiments were conducted to study the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> yields of 30 selected nitrogenous model compounds upon ozonation. The NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> yields of 12 primary and secondary amines were highly variable (17-100%, specific ozone dose of 20\u00a0mol<sub>O3</sub>/mol<sub>N</sub>), 7 amino acids had high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> yields (\u226590%), and tertiary amines as well as pyrrole, acetamide and urea had low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> yields (\u226415%). The mechanisms of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation were further examined with benzylamine and N-methylbenzylamine as model compounds. Our results show that nitroalkanes are the last intermediate products before the formation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, both for primary and secondary amines. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group in the vicinity of the N-atom facilitates the formation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from nitroalkanes. Therefore, the formation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is attributed to amino acids and activated primary and secondary amines. In contrast, all primary and secondary amines were transformed to chloramines upon chlorination, which was determined by a novel oxidative titration with chlorine. To further support the selectivity of this assay, it was demonstrated by derivatization of amine moieties that chloramine formation could be inhibited. 13-45% of the DON of 4 dissolved organic matter isolates and 2 wastewater effluents formed NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and 0-39% formed chloramines, indicating that the potential for N-DBP formation is high (\u00b5M<sub>N</sub>/mg<sub>C</sub>-level). From differences in the formation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and chloramines the nature of the precursors can be hypothesized (e.g., activated or non-activated primary and secondary amines, partially oxidized nitrogenous compounds). This study highlights the capacity of two novel methods to characterize the oxidant-reactive DON fraction. Our results suggest that this fraction is significant and could form a variety of potentially toxic N-DBPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
