Previous reviews suggest that environmental changes will substantially affect future yields of starchy dietary staples. To date, no comprehensive global analysis of the impacts of environmental change on (nonstaple) vegetables and legumes-important constituents of healthy diets-has been reported. We systematically searched for articles published between 1975 and 2016 on the effects of ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, water availability, and salinization on yields and nutritional quality of vegetables and legumes. We estimated mean effects of standardized environmental changes using observed exposure-response relationships and conducted meta-analyses where possible. We identified 174 relevant papers reporting 1,540 experiments. The mean (95% CI) reported yield changes for all vegetables and legumes combined were +22.0% (+11.6% to +32.5%) for a 250-ppm increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, -8.9% (-15.6% to -2.2%) for a 25% increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration,-34.7% (-44.6% to -24.9%) for a 50% reduction in water availability, and -2.3% (-3.7% to -0.9%) for a 25% increase in salinity. In papers with baseline temperatures >20 \u00b0C, a 4 \u00b0C increase in temperature reduced mean yields by -31.5% (-41.4% to -21.5%). Impacts of environmental changes on nutritional quality were mixed. In a business-as-usual scenario, predicted changes in environmental exposures would lead to reductions in yields of nonstaple vegetables and legumes. Where adaptation possibilities are limited, this may substantially change their global availability, affordability, and consumption in the mid to long term. Our results stress the importance of prioritizing agricultural developments, to minimize potential reductions in vegetable and legume yields and associated negative health effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom; Pauline.Scheelbeek@lshtm.ac.uk."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6209-2284"], "LastName": "Scheelbeek", "ForeName": "Pauline F D", "Initials": "PFD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bird", "ForeName": "Frances A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Helsinki, Ruralia Institute, 50100 Mikkeli, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tuomisto", "ForeName": "Hanna L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Rosemary", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harris", "ForeName": "Francesca B", "Initials": "FB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joy", "ForeName": "Edward J M", "Initials": "EJM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1H 9SH, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chalabi", "ForeName": "Zaid", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Elizabeth", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1H 9SH, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haines", "ForeName": "Andy", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6908-1273"], "LastName": "Dangour", "ForeName": "Alan D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "106924/Z/15/Z", "Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "205200/Z/16/Z", "Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Porter JR, et al.
