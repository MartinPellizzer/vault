The operating and management conditions for water reclamation plants in China have been changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China at the end of 2019 to prevent emerging viruses being spread through wastewater treatment processes and the reclaimed water that is produced. Removal of pathogens and trace organic compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals) in a real water reclamation plant after the start of COVID-19 epidemic was studied. Disinfection byproduct formation caused by chlorine being added to meet disinfection requirements was also assessed. The pathogenic microorganism concentrations in effluent were <2 (most probable number)/L, and the removal rates for most trace organic compounds were >80% when advanced treatments were performed using ozone, ultraviolet light, and chlorine doses of 2\u00a0mg/L, 20.5\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, and 2-3\u00a0mg/L, respectively. The main disinfection byproduct produced at a chlorine dose of 2\u00a0mg/L and a residence time of 1\u00a0h was chloroform (at concentrations <15\u00a0\u03bcg/L). The results indicated that the water reclamation processes with modified conditions gave high pathogen and trace organic compound removal rates and reasonably well-controlled disinfection byproduct concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
