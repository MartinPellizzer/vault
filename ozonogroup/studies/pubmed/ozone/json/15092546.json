The experiment ran for three consecutive seasons 1982-1983, 1983-1984, 1984-1985, and significant effects of filtration were observed for each crop. In years 1982-1983 and 1984-1985, the crops in unfiltered air yielded larger grain dry matter, 9% in 1982-1983, and 8% in 1984-1985. For both crops, the differences were statistically significant at the 5% level. Differences were also observed for the remaining above-ground dry matter, and these were consistent in direction in each year but statistically significant only in 1984-1985. In both growing seasons (1982-1983 and 1984-1985), there were no major pest infestations and no long-term water stress or photochemical ozone episodes. In the remaining experiment (1983-1984) similar air concentrations of SO2 and NO2 produced effects of the opposite sign to those observed in 1982-1983 and 1984-1985. Significant reductions in grain yield (13%) were obtained in unfiltered air. The only major environmental difference for the 1983-1984 crop was a notable dry period in May and June 1984 with marked water stress in the crop, requiring irrigation. These results suggest that the relationship between yield and pollutant concentration may be confounded by additional stresses, many of which are a common component of the growing season for major crops."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Penicuik, Midlothian, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fowler", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cape", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leith", "ForeName": "I D", "Initials": "ID"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paterson", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinnaird", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nicholson", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092546", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90030-9", "0269749188900309"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
