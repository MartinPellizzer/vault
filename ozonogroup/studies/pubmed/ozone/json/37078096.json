Gas fumigants mainly include SO<sub>2</sub>, ClO<sub>2</sub>, ozone, NO, CO, 1-MCP, essential oils, H<sub>2</sub>S and ethanol. This work indicated that gas fumigation preservatives can effectively improve postharvest fruit quality, which is mainly manifested in delaying senescence, inhibiting browning, controlling disease and alleviating chilling injury. Gas preservatives are mainly involved in postharvest fruit quality control in the roles of antifungal agent, anti-browning agent, redox agent, ethylene inhibitors, elicitor and pesticide remover. Different gas preservatives have different roles, but most of them have multiple roles at the same time in postharvest fruit quality management. In addition, the role of some gas preservatives with direct antifungal activity in the control of postharvest fruit diseases can also activate defense systems to improve fruit resistance. It should be noted that some gas fumigation treatments with slow-release effects have been developed recently, which may allow gas fumigation gases to perform better. Moreover, some gas fumigants can cause irrational side effects on the fruit and some combined treatments need to be found to counteract such side effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0519-3684"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wanli", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, PR China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yonggui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4648-9572"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, PR China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yueming", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1156-6021"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhengke", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37078096", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2202775"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
