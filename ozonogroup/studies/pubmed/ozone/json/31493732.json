In this study, thermal-alkaline (THALK), ozonation (OZN), electrolysis (EC) and NaClO-promoted electrolysis (EC-AOP) were investigated to facilitate WAS solubilization and production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). EEMF-PARAFAC and FT-ICR-MS were employed to characterize the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in WAS fermentation liquors at molecular level. THALK achieved the highest fluorescence intensity of C1 protein after pretreatment. Proteins and lipids were the dominant DOM in the pretreated WAS, while the DOM shifted towards substances with higher H/C and lower O/C after fermentation. The BNR results showed that THALK (100%) and EC-AOP (96.9%) outperformed other groups (78.9-90.3%) in terms of NO<sub>3</sub>-N removal, indicating the significant impact of DOM compositions. Overall, these results demonstrated that THALK and EC-AOP effectively enhanced release of VFAs and DOM, which subsequently improved NO<sub>3</sub>-N removal efficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
