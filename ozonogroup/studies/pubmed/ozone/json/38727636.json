The interplay between pathological factors like hypoxia-ischemia, chronic inflammation, bacterial infection, impaired angiogenesis, and accumulation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), resulting from the dysregulation of the immune microenvironment caused by hyperglycemia, establishes an unending cycle that hampers wound healing. However, there remains a dearth of sufficient and effective approaches to break this vicious cycle within the complex immune microenvironment. Consequently, numerous scholars have directed their research efforts towards addressing chronic diabetic wound repair. In recent years, gases including Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), Nitric oxide (NO), Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Carbon monoxide (CO) and Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), along with gas-releasing materials associated with them have emerged as promising therapeutic solutions due to their ability to regulate angiogenesis, intracellular oxygenation levels, exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects while effectively minimizing drug residue-induced damage and circumventing drug resistance issues. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in the mechanisms of action and treatment of these gases and related gas-releasing materials in diabetic wound repair. We hope that this review can provide different ideas for the future design and application of gas therapy for chronic diabetic wounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, China. fsygkye@163.com."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Shuming", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, China. fsygkye@163.com."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Neng", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, China. fsygkye@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, China. fsygkye@163.com."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Feixiang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, China. fsygkye@163.com."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0569-2777"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China. guiyangzhang@ahmu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guiyang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, China. 418509326@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0004-8838-026X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230601, China. fsygkye@163.com."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Juehua", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomater Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101593571", "ISSNLinking": "2047-4830"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YY9FVM7NSN", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Foot"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38727636", "10.1039/d4bm00351a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
