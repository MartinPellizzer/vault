The results indicated that low levels of Br<sup>-</sup> (\u226420\u00a0\u03bcM) enhanced NDMA from 3.27 to 7.56\u00a0\u03bcg/L, while its amount slightly dropped to 6.22\u00a0\u03bcg/L raising Br<sup>-</sup> to 100\u00a0\u03bcM. It was experimentally verified that intermediates 1,1-dimethylsemicarbazide (DMSC) and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) played important roles on promoting NDMA generation, whose contribution rates were 40.2% and 32.2%, respectively. The brominated substances with higher NDMA molar yields were detected. \u2219OH reduced NDMA formation without Br<sup>-</sup>, while it played promotion role with Br<sup>-</sup>; the corresponding contribution rates were -\u00a026.9% and 29.2%, respectively. No matter with or without Br<sup>-</sup>, both \u2219O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>l</sup>O<sub>2</sub> brought a boost to NDMA formation, their contribution ratios were 34.9% and 58.1% without Br<sup>-</sup>, while raised significantly to 64.6% and 81.5% when Br<sup>-</sup> existed. Br<sup>-</sup> not only facilitated NDMA formation, but also benefited the degradation of TMDS. Based on the calculation results and intermediates detected, the influence mechanisms of Br<sup>-</sup> were proposed. The results would provide theoretical basis and technical guarantee for treating NDMA precursors and bromide co-existing water in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
