They can undergo degradation when exposed to atmospheric oxidants like ozone and hydroxyl radicals. The majority of studies on the atmospheric reactivity of pesticides study them in combination, without considering potential mixture effects that could induce uncertainties in the results. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap, through laboratory studies using a flow reactor, and by evaluating the degradation kinetics of pendimethalin mixed with folpet, tebuconazole, and S-metolachlor, which were simultaneously adsorbed on hydrophobic silica particles that mimic atmospheric aerosols. The comparison with other mixtures, including pendimethalin, from the literature has shown similar reactivity with ozone and hydroxyl radicals, indicating that the degradation kinetics of pesticides is independent of the mixture. Moreover, the degradation rates of the four pesticides under study indicate that they are not or slightly degraded by ozone, with half-lives ranging from 29 days to over 800 days. In contrast, when exposed to hydroxyl radicals, tebuconazole exhibited the fastest reactivity, with a half-life of 4 days, while pendimethalin had a half-life of 17 days."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
