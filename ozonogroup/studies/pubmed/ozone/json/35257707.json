Biological, chemical and physical methods have been proposed to treat landfill leachate, but much attention has been paid to the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), due to their high adaptability and organic degradation efficiency. This paper summarizes the recent findings on the AOPs based on hydroxyl radical (OH) (e.g., ozonation and catalyzed ozone oxidations, Fenton and Fenton-like oxidations) and sulfate radical (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) (e.g., activated and catalyzed persulfate oxidations), especially the production routes of free radicals and mechanisms of action. When dealing with some special landfill leachates, it is difficult for a single advanced oxidation technology to achieve the expected results, but the synergistic combination with biological or physical methods can produce satisfactory outcomes. Therefore, this paper has summarized the application of these combined treatment technologies on landfill leachate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
