Two residential clusters of asthmatics in the Houston area have been studied as part of an overall attempt to assess the health effects of air pollution in the Texas Gulf Coast area. Air pollutant exposure data have been produced according to a three-tier monitoring scheme, i.e. (1) continuous data from centrally-located fixed stations, (2) residential indoor/outdoor measurements, and (3) personal monitoring. This air monitoring network should yield estimates of individual exposures for use in health effect correlations.The fixed sites and mobile continuously monitor ambient levels of ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind direction, temperature, dew point, solar irradiation, and precipitation). Continuous sequential integrated sampling is preformed for total suspended particulates (TSP) and, inhalable particulates (IP) (total of < 2.5\u03bcm and 2.5-15.0 \u03bcm) by dichotomous samplers for 24 hr samplers), aldehydes (bubblers), and aeroallergens (intermittent rotorod samplers). In addition to gravimetric determinations, particulate filters are routinely analyzed for sulfate, nitrate, and (every third day) trace elements. Personal monitoring includes ozone, respirable particles, nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde. A quality assurance/control program that meets specifications established in the EPA Quality Assurance Handbook for air pollution measurement systems was implemented. Examples of results consisting of unvalidated preliminary data from the monitoring for ozone for three participants is presented and approaches to determining exposure estimates are discussed for both an integrated exposure estimate and short time period exposure estimate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 27711, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotchmar", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stock", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holguin", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buffler", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Air Pollut Control Assoc. 1981 Feb;31(2):153-9", "ArticleIdList": ["7217532"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24264196", "10.1007/BF00399161"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
