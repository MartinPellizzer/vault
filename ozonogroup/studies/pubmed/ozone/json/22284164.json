A Pyrex tube with the deposited salt sample was introduced into the flow reactor along its axis. The ClO uptake coefficient on the KBr surface did not depend on temperature within the experimental accuracy of \u223c20%. Chlorine oxide radicals were prepared using the reaction of Cl with ozone. It was found out that the ClO uptake coefficient strongly depended on ozone concentration. The uptake coefficients at T = 293 K and [O(3)] = 4.6 \u00d7 10(13) molecules cm(-3) were found to be (9.6 \u00b1 5.7) \u00d7 10(-4), (3.7 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10(-4), and (12.3 \u00b1 3.6) \u00d7 10(-4) for KBr, NaCl, and NaBr, respectively. Bromine-containing species were not observed during the interaction of ClO radicals with KBr film. The results obtained indicate that the ClO loss through heterogeneous interaction with salt surface is not sufficiently rapid to compete with gas-phase self-reaction in the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Kosygin str. 4, 119991 Moscow, Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vasiliev", "ForeName": "Evgenii S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loukhovitskaya", "ForeName": "Ekaterina E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morozov", "ForeName": "Igor I", "Initials": "II"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savilov", "ForeName": "Sergei V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lunin", "ForeName": "Valerii V", "Initials": "VV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22284164", "10.1021/jp211357y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
