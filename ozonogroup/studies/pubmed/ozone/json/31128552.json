The hourly concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> measured at different regulatory monitoring network stations in Ahvaz city were obtained from the Department of Environment (DOE) of the city. Then, for various air quality monitoring stations, the 24-h average concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 1-h average of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and maximum daily 8-h O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were calculated using Excel 2010 software. When the maximum daily 8-h ozone means exceeding the value of 35, it was subtracted from 35 to calculate SOMO35 indicator for modeling. Validation of air quality data was performed according to the Aphekom and WHO's methodologies for health impact assessment of air pollution. Year-specific city population and baseline incidence of the health outcomes were obtained. The three-year averages of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were 68.95 (\u00b139.86) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 135.90 (\u00b147.82) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and 38.63 (\u00b112.83) parts-per-billion-volume (ppbv), respectively. SOMO35 values of ozone were 6596.66, 3411.78, and 470.88\u202fppbv in 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017 years, respectively. The AP and number of natural deaths due to NO<sub>2</sub> were higher than PM<sub>2.5</sub> except the last year (2016-2017), causing about 39.18%, 40.73%, and 14.39% of deaths within the first, the second, and the third year, respectively. However, for the last year, the natural mortality for PM<sub>2.5</sub> was higher than NO<sub>2</sub> (34.46% versus 14.39%). The total number of natural mortality caused by PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in all years was 4061 and 4391, respectively. A significant number of deaths was estimated to be attributed to the given air pollutants. It can be concluded that by designing and implementing air pollution control strategies and actions, both health effects and economic losses will be prevented."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
