In the present study we investigated how shoot canopy position and high levels of stressors such as high temperature and ozone concentration, affect BVOC emission rates by means of in-situ and ex-situ experimental measurements. Therefore, BVOC emission from current-year spruce shoots was investigated under field and manipulated (temperature, ozone) laboratory conditions. Emitted BVOCs were sampled on desorption tubes, coupled with gas-exchange measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate and stomatal conductance, and detected by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Total BVOC emission rates from sun shoots under standard conditions were higher than those from shade shoots, although this was significant only in July, on the contrary, only \u03b1-pinene and \u03b3-terpinene emission rates showed significant differences between sun and shade acclimated shoots in August. Limonene, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, and myrcene were identified as the most abundant BVOCs in both campaigns with emission rates above 0.2\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. Ex-situ measurements revealed a significantly higher total BVOC emissions under high temperature level (40\u00a0\u00b0C) by ca. 175% as compared with standard temperature (30\u00a0\u00b0C), while a short-term fumigation of acute O<sub>3</sub> concentration (200\u00a0ppb) had no effect on BVOC emissions and its spectrum. These findings might have a relevance considering the role of these compounds in protecting against oxidative stress and their possible stimulation in particular stressful conditions. Implication of such results into emission models may contribute to a more accurate estimation of BVOC emissions for Central European mountain regions dominated by Norway spruce forests and their rate under predicted climate change."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
