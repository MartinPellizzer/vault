Traditionally the atomic layer deposition technique is used for the fabrication of thin films, however, we find that needles of beta-MnO2 are formed when manganese (IV) oxide is deposited as relatively thick (ca. 800 nm) thin films on substrates of alpha-Al2O3 [(001) and (012) oriented]. There is no formation of needles when the film is deposited on substrates such as Si(100) or soda lime glass. The film is formed using Mn(thd)3 (Hthd = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dione) and ozone as precursors. While thin films (ca. 100 nm) consist of epsilon'-MnO2, the same process applied to thicker films results in the formation of nano-needles of beta-MnO2. These needles of beta-MnO2 have dimensions ranging from approximately 1.5 microm at the base down to very sharp tips. The nano-needles and the bulk of the films have been analysed by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, and Centre for Materials Science and Nanotechnology, University of Oslo, P.O.
