However, studies which explored the burden of ozone pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and estimated the relevant economic loss were rare.", "We explored the relationships between ambient ozone exposure and years of life lost (YLL) from COPD mortality and estimated the relevant economic loss in Ningbo, in the Yangtze River Delta of China, 2011-2015.", "A time-series study was conducted to explore the effects of ozone on YLL from COPD. Seasonal stratified analyses were performed, and the effect modification of demographic factors was estimated. In addition, the related economic loss was calculated using the method of the value per statistical life year (VSLY).", "Averaged daily mean maximum 8-h average ozone concentration was 40.90\u202fppb in Ningbo, China, 2011-2015. The effect of short term ambient ozone exposure on COPD YLL was more pronounced in the cool season than in the warm season, with 10\u202fppb increment of ozone corresponding to 7.09(95%CI: 3.41, 10.78) years increase in the cool season and 0.31 (95%CI:\u00a0-2.15, 2.77) years change in the warm season. The effect was higher in the elderly than the young. Economic loss due to excess COPD YLL related to ozone exposure accounted for 7.30% of the total economic loss due to COPD YLL in Ningbo during the study period.", "Our findings highlight that ozone exposure was related to tremendous disease burden of COPD in Ningbo, China.
