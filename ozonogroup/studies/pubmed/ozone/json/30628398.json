The results show that 19.2% of the permanganate index, 10.4% of total organic carbon, and 23.0% of UV<sub>254</sub> were removed by the advanced treatment of O<sub>3</sub>-BAC. Eight types of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), 16 types of organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), and five types of haloacetic acids (HAAs) were detected in the source water. The total concentrations were 53.9-100.0, 6.5-41.8, and 2.5\u00d710<sup>3</sup>-1.1\u00d710<sup>4</sup> ng\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The advanced O<sub>3</sub>-BAC treatment removed 32.5% of PAHs and 25.9% of OCPs, greatly improving the effluent of the conventional water supply process. However, HAAs were mainly removed with the conventional process, with a removal rate of 33.8%-87.0%. After the advanced treatment with O<sub>3</sub>-BAC, the amount of chloroacetic acid slightly decreased, while the concentration of bromoacetic acid slightly increased."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Water Science and Technology, Department of Environment in Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University of Zhejiang, Jiaxing 314006, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Ya-Qiong", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Water Science and Technology, Department of Environment in Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University of Zhejiang, Jiaxing 314006, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Water Science and Technology, Department of Environment in Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University of Zhejiang, Jiaxing 314006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zheng-Jie", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Water Science and Technology, Department of Environment in Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University of Zhejiang, Jiaxing 314006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L\u00fc-Jun", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30628398", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201712003"]}}]}
