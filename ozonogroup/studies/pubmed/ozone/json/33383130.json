This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of pyroptosis and related signaling pathways in ozone-induced lung injury.", "We exposed 120 Wistar rats to ozone, 20 in each group (half male and half female). Ozone exposure concentrations were 0, 0.12, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0\u2009ppm for 6\u2009h. At the same time, we isolated and cultured type I alveolar epithelial cells, then intervened with high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), hyaluronic acid (HA) and Toll-like receptors 2/4 (TLR2/4) inhibitor. In animal experiments, histopathological experiments, TUNEL, ELISA and biochemical indicators were performed. RT-qPCR and western blot experiments assay were used to detect the expression changes of key factors in relevant signal pathways in vivo and in vitro.", "After acute ozone exposure, the levels of lung cell injury indicators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), as well as the levels of inflammatory factors in BALF, blood, and lung tissue were significantly increased. Male rats were more sensitive to ozone exposure. Low-concentration ozone exposure caused mild interstitial inflammation in rat lung tissue. Severe inflammation and pulmonary edema appeared with increases in concentration. ELISA results in BALF showed that HMGB1 and HA expressions increased gradually with the increase of ozone exposure concentration. RT-qPCR and Western blot showed that when ozone concentrations increased above 0.5\u2009ppm, the expression of nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, and N-gasdermin D (N-GSDMD) in the lung tissue increased significantly, suggesting that ozone exposure induces pyroptosis. At the same time, it was found that ozone exposure activated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signal pathway, and increased the mRNA expressions of Toll-like receptors TLR2/4. The results of cell experiments showed that after the addition of HMGB1 and HA, the expression of NF-\u03baB and pyroptosis related indexes increased in type I alveolar epithelial cells, while the corresponding expression decreased after the addition of TLR2/4 inhibitors.", "Ozone exposure causes lung injury in a dose- and gender-dependent manner, and is more severe in males. When injured, the levels of HMGB1 and HA in BALF increased, which interact with TLR 2/4 to activate the downstream NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.
