These compounds are known to be the major sources of cloud condensation nuclei in the oceanic atmosphere and ideally should be measured onsite because of their volatility and instability. First, chemical and physical vapor generations were examined, and simple pressurizing by injection of 30 mL of air using a syringe was adopted. Pressurized headspace air above a 10 mL water sample was introduced to a detection cell as a result of the pressure differential and mixed with ozone to induce chemiluminescence. Although the measurement procedure was simple, the method was very sensitive: sharp peaks appeared within seconds for nanomolar levels of DMS, and the limit of detection was 0.02 nmol L(-1) (1 ng L(-1)). Although interference from methanethiol was significant, this was successfully addressed by adding a small amount of Cd(2+) before DMS vapor generation. DMSP was also measured after hydrolysis to DMS, as previously reported. Pond water and seawater samples were analyzed, and DMS was found in both types of sample, whereas DMSP was observed only in seawater. The DMS/DMSP data obtained using the developed method were compared with data obtained by purge/trap and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the data from the two methods agreed, with good correlation (R(2) = 0.9956). The developed device is inexpensive, light (5 kg), simple to use, can be applied in the field, and is sensitive enough for fresh- and seawater analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Kumamoto University, 2-39-1 Kurokami, Kumamoto, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagahata", "ForeName": "Takanori", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kajiwara", "ForeName": "Hidetaka", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohira", "ForeName": "Shin-Ichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toda", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C884XA7QGG", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethylpropiothetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QS3J7O7L3U", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethyl sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23551252", "10.1021/ac303803w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
