Three different frequencies were studied (44, 300 and 1000\u00a0kHz) at an applied power of 40\u00a0W. The injected ozone dose was fixed at 71\u00a0mg/L and the treatment time varied from 1 to 60\u00a0min. Using ultrasound alone, 300\u00a0kHz was the only frequency showing a reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD, 18% reduction) and biological oxygen demand (BOD, 50% reduction), while no diminution in microbial content was measured for any of the frequencies studied. Combining ultrasound with ozone, on the contrary, led to a significant decrease in COD (44%) and BOD (78%) removal for the three frequencies under study. A complete inactivation of total coliforms (TC) was obtained, as well as a final value of 99\u00a0CFU/mL in total viable counts (TVC, 5 log reduction). That is, the ozonation-sonication combined system was the only treatment method (compared to sonication and ozonation alone) reaching direct discharge limits, as well as meeting drinking water standards for microbial disinfection (TC and TVC)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
