A lack of photoabsorption data in the intermediate energy region from 24 to 524 eV necessitates the use of a mixture rule in that region. For this purpose, a DOSD for O(2) is constructed first. The dipole properties for O(2) are essentially the same as those obtained in earlier work even though most of the input data is from more recent experiments. A discrepancy is found between the refractivity data and photoabsorption data in the 10-20.6 eV range for ozone. A reliable ozone DOSD of the sort obtained for many other species remains out of reach. However, it is suggested that the true dipole properties of ozone lie between those predicted by two distributions that we present."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 American Institute of Physics"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, New Brunswick E3B 5A3, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Ashok", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thakkar", "ForeName": "Ajit J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21861566", "10.1063/1.3626523"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
