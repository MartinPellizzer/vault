Antigen presentation is one of the factors contributing to the allergic reaction. Therefore, we investigated the effects of repeated exposure to O(3) on antigen-presenting (AP) activity, on the expression of cell-surface molecules associated with antigen presentation (Ia, B7.1, B7.2 and CD11b/c) in bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BAL cells), and on allergic asthma-like symptoms. Rats were exposed to 0.3, 0.56, 1ppm O(3) or filtered air for a 3-day period every 2 weeks, this was replicated three times. AP activity was assessed by measuring antigen-specific T-cell proliferation; and the expression of cell-surface molecules, by flow cytometry. Rats were also made to inhale aerosolized 1% ovalbumin (OVA) or saline for 10min post-exposure to O(3), and allergic asthma-like symptoms were measured by determining the increase in enhanced pause (Penh), which correlates well with lung resistance. O(3) increased both AP activity and expression of Ia and costimulatory molecules in BAL cells concentration dependently. It also increased lung resistance, and the increase in lung resistance after O(3) exposure was significantly higher in the OVA-inhaled group than in the saline-inhaled group. The present results show that O(3) increased AP activity concentration dependently and suggest that O(3) might aggravate allergy symptoms by enhancing AP activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PM2.5 and DEP Research Project, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Onogawa 16-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan. ekoike@nies.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koike", "ForeName": "Eiko", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Haruka", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigen Presentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigen-Presenting Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Separation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "immunology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15003332", "10.1016/j.tox.2003.12.007", "S0300483X03005511"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
