To gain more insight into the physiological role of vitamin E, the levels of its oxidation products in humans under normal and pathological conditions were compared. \u03b1-Tocopherol quinone (\u03b1-TQ) and 5-nitro-\u03b3-tocopherol (5-NgT) were focused. \u03b1-TQ is produced by multiple oxidants including oxygen radicals, peroxynitrite, hypochlorite, singlet oxygen, and ozone, while 5-NgT is produced by nitrogen dioxide radical derived from peroxynitrite and the reaction of nitrite and hypochlorite. The reported concentrations of \u03b1-TQ and 5-NgT in healthy human plasma are highly variable ranging from 15 to 360 and 4 to 170\u2009nM, respectively. In general, the molar ratio 5-NgT/\u03b3-tocopherol was higher than the ratio \u03b1-TQ/\u03b1-tocopherol. Both absolute concentrations of \u03b1-TQ and 5-NgT and the molar ratios to the parent tocopherols were elevated significantly in the plasma of patients with various diseases compared with healthy subjects except neurological diseases. The molar ratios of the products to the respective parent compounds decreased in the order of 5-NgT/\u03b3-tocopherol\u2009>\u2009\u03b1-TQ/\u03b1-tocopherol\u2009>\u2009hydroxyoctadecadienoate/linoleate > 3-nitrotyrosine/tyrosine\u2009>\u2009isoprostane/arachidonate. The molar ratios of nitrated products to the respective parent compounds in human plasma are approximately 10<sup>-2</sup> for 5-NgT and 10<sup>-5</sup> for 3-nitrotyrosine, nitro-oleic acid, and 8-nitroguaine. These data indicate that vitamin E acts as an important physiological antioxidant and that \u03b1-TQ and 5-NgT represent biomarker for oxidative stress and nitrative stress respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Komaba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Niki", "ForeName": "Etsuo", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan."}], "LastName": "Noguchi", "ForeName": "Noriko", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "5-nitro-gamma-tocopherol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7559-04-8", "NameOfSubstance": "tocopherylquinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8EF1Z1238F", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Tocopherol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "biosynthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Tocopherol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33327809", "10.1080/10715762.2020.1866181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
