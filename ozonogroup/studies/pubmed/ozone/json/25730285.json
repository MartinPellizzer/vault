Using standard reactivity metrics for ozone-based AOPs (RCT values), MWCNTs promoted \u2022OH formation during ozonation to levels exceeding ozone (both alone and with activated carbon) and equivalent to ozone with hydrogen peroxide. MWCNTs oxidized with nitric acid exhibited vastly greater rates of ozone consumption and \u2022OH formation relative to as-received MWCNTs. While some of this enhancement reflects their greater suspension stability, a strong correlation between RCT values and surface oxygen concentrations from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that surface sites generated during MWCNT oxidation promote \u2022OH exposure. Removal of several ozone-recalcitrant species [para-chlorobenzoic acid (p-CBA), atrazine, DEET, and ibuprofen] was not significantly inhibited in the presence of radical scavengers (humic acid, carbonate), in complex aquatic matrices (Iowa River water) and after 12 h of continuous exposure of MWCNTs to concentrated ozone solutions. As a proof-of-concept, oxidized MWCNTs deposited on a ceramic membrane chemically oxidized p-CBA in a flow through system, with removal increasing with influent ozone concentration and mass of deposited MWCNTs (in mg/cm2). This hybrid membrane platform, which integrates adsorption, oxidation, and filtration via an immobilized MWCNT layer, may serve as the basis for future novel nanomaterial-enabled technologies, although long-term performance trials under representative treatment scenarios remain necessary."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Iowa, 4105 Seamans Center, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, United States."}], "LastName": "Oulton", "ForeName": "Rebekah", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Iowa, 4105 Seamans Center, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Henry B.
