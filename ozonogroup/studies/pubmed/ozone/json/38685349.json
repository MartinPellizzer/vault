Surgical procedures induced spinal cord trauma in all groups, except the control group. The ozone group received 0.7\u00a0mg/kg rectal ozone daily for 7 days, starting 1 hour postspinal cord trauma. The CoQ10 group was administered 120\u00a0mg/kg CoQ10 orally once daily for 7 days, beginning 24\u00a0hours prior to trauma. The CoQ10\u00a0+\u00a0ozone group received both treatments. Examinations included a modified Tarlov scale and inclined plane test on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Malondialdehyde (MDA) analysis was conducted on serum samples, and assessments of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax levels were performed on tissue samples. Additionally, a comprehensive examination analyzed histopathological and ultrastructural changes.", "After SCI, there was a statistically significant increase in serum MDA, tissue caspase-3, and Bax levels (MDA P < 0.001, caspase-3 P < 0.001, Bax P\u00a0= 0.003). In the CoQ10\u00a0+\u00a0ozone group, serum MDA (P\u00a0= 0.002), tissue caspase-3 (P\u00a0= 0.001), and Bax (P\u00a0= 0.030) levels were significantly lower compared to the trauma group. Tissue Bcl-2 levels were also significantly higher (P\u00a0= 0.019). The combined treatment group demonstrated improved histopathological, ultrastructural, and neurological outcomes.", "This study shows that CoQ10\u00a0+\u00a0ozone therapy in traumatic SCI demonstrates neuroprotective effects via antioxidant and antiapoptotic mechanisms. The positive effects on functional recovery are supported by data from biochemical, histopathological, ultrastructural, and neurological examinations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
