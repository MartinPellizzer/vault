It is therefore important to monitor the amounts of pollutants injected into the atmosphere from various sources. Most countries have a ground network with multiple measuring sites and instruments, that can measure the air quality index (AQI). However, the main challenge with the networks is the low spatial coverage. In this work, satellite data is used to calculate for the first time the spatial distribution of AQI and pollutant concentration over South Africa. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard Sentinel-5P data is used to calculate AQI from carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) gases. The results that the month of June has the worst air quality distribution throughout the country, while March has the best air quality distribution. Overall, the results clearly show that TROPOMI has the capability to measure air quality at a country and city level.<i>Implications</i>: In this work, satellite data is used to calculate for the first time the spatial distribution of the air quality index (AQI) and pollutant concentration over South Africa. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard Sentinel-5P data is used to calculate AQI from carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) gases. Currently, South Africa has a ground network of instruments that measure AQ, however, the network does not cover the whole country. In this work, we show that the use of TROPOMI can compliment the current network and provide data for the areas not covered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4241-2970"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth Observation Directorate, South African National Space Agency, Pretoria, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Shikwambana", "ForeName": "Lerato", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9553-0378"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, Environmental Management and Energy Studies, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Kganyago", "ForeName": "Mahlatse", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, University of Zululand, KwaDlangezwa, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mbatha", "ForeName": "Nkanyiso", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mhangara", "ForeName": "Paidamwoyo", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38905515", "10.1080/10962247.2024.2369751"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
