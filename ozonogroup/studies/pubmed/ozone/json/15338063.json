These combinations were used to confirm the clinical data and to validate the concept of clinic modelling randomised trials (CMRTs) in a rat model of intra-abdominal sepsis.", "80 male Wistar rats were randomised in a 2 x 2 factorial study design.", "All animals (n = 20/group) received anaesthesia, antihistamines, antibiotic prophylaxis, peritoneal contamination and infection.

G-CSF (20 g/kg) prophylaxis was applied three times.", "Survival at 120 h was analysed with the Kaplan Meier method.", "Survival rate was best in the G-CSF + cef/met group with 75% and was significantly improved compared to the cef/met placebo group, in which only 42% survived (P < 0.05). Survival rate between both G-CSF groups was similar being 75% in the cef/met and 72% in the ofl/met group. P = 0.10).
