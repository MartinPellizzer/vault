The iterative models ic-MRCCSDT-1, ic-MRCC3, and their variants ic-MRCCSD(T), ic-MRCC(3) which determine the energy correction from triples by a non-iterative step are consistent in the single-reference limit with CCSDT-1a, CC3, CCSD(T), and CC(3), respectively. Numerical tests on the potential energy surfaces of BeH(2), H(2)O, and N(2) as well as on the structure and harmonic vibrational frequencies of the ozone molecule show that these methods account very well for higher order correlation effects. The ic-MRCCSD(T) method is further applied to the geometry optimization and harmonic frequencies of the symmetric vibrational modes of the binuclear transition metal oxide Ni(2)O(2), to the singlet-triplet splittings of o-, m-, and p-benzyne and to a ring-opening reaction of an azirine compound with the molecular formula C(6)H(7)NO. The size of the active spaces used in this study ranges from CAS(2,2) to CAS(8,8). Comparisons of results based on differently sized active spaces indicate that the ic-MRCCSD(T) method provides a highly accurate and efficient treatment of both static and dynamic electron correlation in connection with minimal active spaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie, Universit\u00e4t Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany. hanauem@uni-mainz.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hanauer", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00f6hn", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22667540", "10.1063/1.4718700"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
