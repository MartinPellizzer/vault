This study provides insights on the impact of oxidative pre-treatment with chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), ferrate (Fe(VI)) and permanganate (Mn(VII)) on Suwannee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM) properties characterized by the UV absorbance at 254\u00a0nm (UV<sub>254</sub>) and the electron donating capacity (EDC). Changes in NOM reactivity and abatement of DBP precursors are also assessed. The impact of pre-oxidants (based on molar concentration) on UV<sub>254</sub> abatement ranked in the order O<sub>3</sub> > Mn(VII) > Fe(VI)/ClO<sub>2</sub>, while the efficiency of pre-oxidation on EDC abatement followed the order Mn(VII) > ClO<sub>2</sub> > Fe(VI) > O<sub>3</sub> and two phases were observed. At low specific ClO<sub>2</sub>, Fe(VI) and Mn(VII) doses corresponding to < 50% EDC abatement, a limited relative abatement of UV<sub>254</sub> compared to the EDC was observed (~ 8% EDC abatement per 1% UV<sub>254</sub> abatement). This suggests the oxidation of phenolic-type moieties to quinone-type moieties which absorb UV<sub>254</sub> and don't contribute to EDC. At higher oxidant doses (> 50% EDC abatement), a similar abatement of EDC and UV<sub>254</sub> (~ 0.9-1.2% EDC abatement per 1% UV<sub>254</sub> abatement) suggested aromatic ring cleavage. In comparison to the other oxidants, O<sub>3</sub> abated the relative UV<sub>254</sub> more effectively, due to a more efficient cleavage of aromatic rings. For a pre-oxidation with Mn(VII), ClO<sub>2</sub> and Fe(VI), similar correlations between the EDC abatement and the chlorine demand or the adsorbable organic halide (AOX) formation were obtained. In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> pre-treatment led to a lower chlorine demand and AOX formation for equivalent EDC abatement. For all oxidants<sub>,</sub> trihalomethane formation was poorly correlated with both EDC and UV<sub>254.</sub> The EDC abatement was found to be a pre-oxidant-independent surrogate for haloacetonitrile formation. These results emphasize the benefits of combining EDC and UV<sub>254</sub> measurement to understand and monitor oxidant-induced changes of NOM and assessing DBP formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
