However, experiments with hydrogen-terminated H-diamond show that oxygen adsorption plays an instrumental role in inducing the p-type surface conductivity. Using first-principles calculations, we explore how the surface-physisorbed molecular O<sub>2</sub> serves as an electron acceptor in the transfer doping of diamond. On the other hand, calculations reveal that in a chemisorbed state, oxygen groups substitute H, which lowers the bands in diamond and inhibits the transfer doping. This explains the non-monotonic carrier density dependence on the exposure to oxygen (or, similarly, other adsorbent-acceptor). We further find that ozone can be more efficient for p-type doping of H-diamond due to O<sub>3</sub> having lower LUMO energy levels than in molecular O<sub>2</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9125-2371"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Nanoengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Kouser", "ForeName": "Summayya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5763-6411"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Nanoengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Sunny", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8369-3567"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Nanoengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Yakobson", "ForeName": "Boris I", "Initials": "BI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33439614", "10.1021/acsami.0c18719"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
