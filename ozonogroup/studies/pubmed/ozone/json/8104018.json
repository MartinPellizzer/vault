The imperfect evidence associating sun exposure (particularly UVB radiation) with melanoma emerges from human data, obviating problems inherent in extrapolation from animal and other models. However, the mechanism by which sunlight might possibly initiate or promote melanoma remains obscure. Some clarification should emerge from the potential isolation of genes that carry susceptibility to melanoma in families prone to the disease; such work could serve as a basis to distinguish genetic and environmental influences in melanoma [167]. Continued studies of faulty DNA repair in XP patients may elucidate the steps in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Future case-control studies must address the limits on the accuracy of recall and the limits on statistical methods to separate the cluster of phenotypic risk needed in determining biologically effective dose. Animal and in vitro studies must contribute more insight. Further research in the South American opossum models appears promising [72]. Although ozone depletion has been documented, there has been little definitive evidence of subsequent increase of UVB at the Earth's surface. Nevertheless, the threat posed by ozone depletion deserves continued environmental action and public education. The role of precursor lesions, particularly dysplastic nevi/atypical moles, must be clarified with future research. The distribution of melanoma among various work forces suggests that occupational risk factors may play an important role in the etiology of this disease [168-170]. The consistent reports of excess melanoma among accountants, clerical workers, professional workers, and teachers deserve further study. Furthermore, evidence of excesses in printing and press, petrochemical, and the telecommunications industries require follow-up. Carefully planned studies that account for nonoccupational risk factors are recommended. Research over the last four decades has brought much information about melanoma etiology. More work is needed to learn the precise cause and ultimately to prevent avoidable mortality from malignant melanoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boston University Medical Center, Skin Oncology Program, MA 02118."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koh", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sinks", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geller", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lew", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Treat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8008541", "ISSNLinking": "0927-3042"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Precancerous Conditions"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "United States"}], "NumberOfReferences": "176"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8104018", "10.1007/978-1-4615-3080-0_1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
