Here, based on the one-year online VOC measurement in 2018 in Beijing, systematic analyses and model simulation were conducted to illuminate VOC characteristics, emission sources, regional hotspots and behaviours in response to O<sub>3</sub> formation. The observed mean VOC concentration in 2018 was 29.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.64 ppbv declined distinctly compared to that in 2015 and 2016. Vehicle exhaust (39.95%), natural gas/liquefied petroleum gas (22.04%) and industrial sources (20.64%) were the main contributors to VOCs in Beijing. Regional transport, mainly from the south-south-east (SSE) and south-south-west (SSW), quantitatively contributed 36.65%-55.06% to VOCs based on our developed method. O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity tended to be in the transition regime in summer identified by ground-based and satellite observations. Strong solar radiation along with high temperature and low humidity aggravated O<sub>3</sub> pollution that was further intensified by regional transport from southern polluted regions. The model simulation determined that turning off CH<sub>3</sub>CHO related reactions brought about the most predominantly short-term and long-run O<sub>3</sub> reduction, indicating that control policies in VOC species should be tailored, instead of one-size-fits-all. Overall, region-collaborated and active VOC-species-focused strategies on VOC controls are imperative."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
