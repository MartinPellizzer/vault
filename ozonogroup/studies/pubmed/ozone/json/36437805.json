Only controlled clinical trials (randomized or not) were considered. The risk of bias was evaluated by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs - version 1 (RoB1). Data were pooled into evidence tables and a descriptive summary was presented.", "Of the 107 potentially eligible records, only seven studies were included. Four addressed free/deepithelialized gingival grafts with a palatal donor area, two evaluated implant sites, and one comprised gingivectomy and gingivoplasty. A total of 225 patients were evaluated in the included studies, considering control and test groups (ozone and other adjuvant therapies for comparison). Ozone therapy had a positive effect on outcomes directly or indirectly related to periodontal/peri-implant surgical wound healing. Furthermore, it could also increase the stability of immediately loaded single implants installed in the posterior mandible.", "In general, ozone therapy seems to both accelerate the healing processes of periodontal/peri-implant wounds and increase the secondary stability of dental implants; however, considering the limited evidence available and the risk of bias in the included studies (none classified as low risk), a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn.
