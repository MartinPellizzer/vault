While natural abundance stable N isotopes (\u03b4<sup>15</sup>N) in various soil N-containing compounds have proven to be a robust tracer of soil N cycling, soil \u03b4<sup>15</sup>N-NO is rarely quantified due to the measurement difficulties. Here, we present a new method that collects soil-emitted NO through NO conversion to NO<sub>2</sub> in excess ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and subsequent NO<sub>2</sub> collection in a 20% triethanolamine (TEA) solution as nitrite and nitrate for \u03b4<sup>15</sup>N analysis using the denitrifier method. The precision and accuracy of the method were quantified through repeated collection of an analytical NO tank and intercalibration with a modified EPA NO<sub>x</sub> collection method. The results show that the efficiency of NO conversion to NO<sub>2</sub> and subsequent NO<sub>2</sub> collection in the TEA solution is >98% under a variety of controlled conditions. The method precision (1\u03c3) and accuracy across the entire analytical procedure are \u00b11.1\u2030. We report the first analyses of soil \u03b4<sup>15</sup>N-NO (-59.8\u2030 to -23.4\u2030) from wetting-induced NO pulses at both laboratory and field scales that have important implications for understanding soil NO dynamics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4935-0154"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geology and Environmental Science, University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, United States."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhongjie", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geology and Environmental Science, University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, United States."}], "LastName": "Elliott", "ForeName": "Emily M", "Initials": "EM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28467082", "10.1021/acs.est.7b00592"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
