However, the bottlenecks are the rational design of catalysts to selectively induce nonradicals and the interpretation of detailed nonradical generation mechanisms. Herein, we propose a new HCO process based on single-atom iron catalysts, in which Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites anchored on the carbon skeleton exhibited outstanding catalytic ozonation activity and stability for the degradation of oxalic acid (OA) and <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHBA) as well as the advanced treatment of a landfill leachate secondary effluent. Unlike traditional radical oxidation, nonradical pathways based on surface-adsorbed atomic oxygen (*O<sub>ad</sub>) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) were identified. A substrate-dependent behavior was also observed. OA was adsorbed on the catalyst surface and mainly degraded by *O<sub>ad</sub>, while pHBA was mostly removed by O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the bulk solution. Density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that one terminal oxygen atom of ozone preferred bonding with the central iron atom of Fe-N<sub>4</sub>, subsequently inducing the cleavage of the O-O bond near the catalyst surface to produce *O<sub>ad</sub> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. These findings highlight the structural design of an ozone catalyst and an atomic-level understanding of the nonradical HCO process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Tengfei", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Mengxi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shuning", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Changpei", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4076-1464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3196-3443"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoyuan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E7R5L6H31", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36790324", "10.1021/acs.est.2c07653"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
