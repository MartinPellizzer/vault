The results suggest that the frequency of occurrences of relatively low hourly O3 concentrations ( approximately <35 ppb) are not as important as moderate to higher concentrations in eliciting negative crop biomass responses. They also suggest that daily peak (highest) hourly O3 values ( approximately >90 ppb) may not be as critical, most likely because they frequently do not occur during time periods when conditions that promote atmospheric conductivity (O3 deposition) and plant uptake (O3 absorption) are in coherence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, 495 Borlaug Hall, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krupa", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nosal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Legge", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093108", "10.1016/s0269-7491(98)00019-0", "S0269749198000190"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
