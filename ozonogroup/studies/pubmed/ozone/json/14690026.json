The occurrence of DBPs was studied in samples from four drinking-water treatment plants (WTPs) and from the distribution network of Athens, Greece. Twenty-four compounds, which belong to different categories of DBPs, were monitored, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), haloketones (HAKs), chloral hydrate (CH) and chloropicrin (CP). Sampling was performed monthly for a period of two years, from three different points at each WTP and from eight points atthe distribution network. Samples were analyzed by GC-ECD methods, which included pretreatment with liquid-liquid extraction for volatile DBPs and acidic methanol esterification for HAAs. The results of the analyses have shown the presence of disinfection by-products belonging to all categories studied in all water samples collected after prechlorination. The major categories of DBPs detected were THMs and HAAs, while the other volatile DBPs occurred at lower concentrations. The concentrations of DBPs did not in any case exceed the maximum contaminant levels (MCL) set by USEPA and WHO. However, monitoring these compounds needs to be continued, because their levels could increase due to changes in the quality of water entering the water treatment plants. Reduction of the concentrations of DBPs could be achieved by optimization of the chlorination conditions, taking into account the effect of time. Moreover, research on alternative disinfection methods (e.g. ozone, chlorine dioxide, chloramines) and their by-products should be conducted to evaluate their applicability in the case of the drinking water of Greece."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water and Air Quality Laboratory, Department of Environmental Studies, University of Aegean, Karadoni 17, Mytilene 81100, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Golfinopoulos", "ForeName": "Spyros K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nikolaou", "ForeName": "Anastasia D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lekkas", "ForeName": "Themistokles D", "Initials": "TD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Talanta. 2002 Mar 11;56(4):717-26", "ArticleIdList": ["18968548"]}, {"Citation": "J Chromatogr A. 1999 Oct 1;857(1-2):217-29", "ArticleIdList": ["10536840"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2001 Aug;44(5):907-12", "ArticleIdList": ["11513422"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2002 Feb;36(4):1089-94", "ArticleIdList": ["11848347"]}, {"Citation": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol. 1999 Nov;63(5):610-7", "ArticleIdList": ["10541680"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14690026", "10.1065/espr2002.06.124"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
