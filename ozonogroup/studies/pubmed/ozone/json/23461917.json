Intracerebral microdialysis is an in vivo surgical technique that is used to measure the concentration of substances in the extracellular space.", "The rats were stereotaxically implanted with microdialysis cannulae guided to the hypothalamic medial preoptic area and bipolar stainless steel electrodes to obtain sleep records simultaneously with microdialysis samplings during 24 hours exposed to clean air followed by 24 hours of exposure to ozone. Microdialysis fractions were injected into chromatograph system.", "Results showed that paradoxical sleep and wakefulness decreased by 54.2% and 27.9%, respectively, while slow wave sleep increased by 35.1% during the ozone exposure phase and a concomitant decrease of extracellular acetylcholine of 56.2% was observed during the light-dark phase.", "That surgical method employed using electroencephalography and intracerebral microdialysis allows the quantification of extracellular acetylcholine and simultaneously with patterns related to sleep. We propose that the decrease in paradoxical sleep is the behavioral expression of disruptions of cholinergic modulation and, that post-exposure effects observed in the hypothalamic medial preoptic area can be explained on the basis of the hypothalamic role in the sleep-wake cycle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Neuroqu\u00edmica, Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n, D.F.
