Annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), black carbon (BC), and ozone (warm season) were estimated using European-wide hybrid land-use regression models (100\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m) and assigned to baseline residential addresses. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the association between air pollution and mortality, accounting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. We additionally applied indirect adjustment for smoking and body mass index (BMI).", "During 47,023,454 person-years of follow-up, 803,881 people died from natural causes.

A 5\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with higher mortality from all-natural causes (hazard ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.13), cardiovascular disease (1.09; 1.07-1.12), respiratory disease (1.11; 1.07-1.15), lung cancer (1.19; 1.15-1.24), diabetes (1.10; 1.04-1.16), dementia (1.05; 1.00-1.10), psychiatric disorders (1.38; 1.27-1.50), asthma (1.13; 0.94-1.36), and ALRI (1.14; 1.09-1.20). Associations with long-term exposure to ozone (mean: 80.2\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) were generally negative but became significantly positive for several endpoints in two-pollutant models.
