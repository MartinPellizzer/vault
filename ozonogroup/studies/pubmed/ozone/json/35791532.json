Furthermore, the WRF-CMAQ model coupled with O<sub>3</sub> isopleths (EKMA curves) were applied to explore the non-linear response relationship of O<sub>3</sub> to precursors VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, aiming to identify a suitable precursor control strategy. The results showed that the days with the maximum daily 8-hour average ozone concentration (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) exceeded the standard by 70.9%. The nonattainment days were usually accompanied by higher temperature, lower relative humidity, and low winds, and the south and southeast winds occurred frequently. The O<sub>3</sub> formation was in the strong VOC-limited regime in the urban area of Shijiazhuang, whereas it was in the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs transition regime in suburban areas. As for the urban area, under the condition of single NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission reduction, O<sub>3</sub> pollution improved when continuous NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission reduction was higher than 50% during the nonattainment days. By contrast, during the non-polluted days, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations would not rebound when the reduction ratio of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs was higher than 1. In conclusion, VOCs reduction should be the priority for emission reduction plans in urban areas, whereas all different NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs ratios led to a decline in O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the suburban areas, and a VOCs:NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> of 1:2 was recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Faculty of Environmental and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jia-Xian", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Faculty of Environmental and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qi", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Faculty of Environmental and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Sheng-Ju", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Faculty of Environmental and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35791532", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202110085"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
