The latest anthropogenic Cl emissions, including gaseous HCl and particulate chloride (pCl<sup>-</sup>) emissions from the Anthropogenic Chlorine Emissions Inventory of China (ACEIC-2014) (over China) and a global emissions inventory (Zhang et al., 2022) (over outer China), were used to examine the impacts of Cl emissions and the role of nitryl chloride (ClNO<sub>2</sub>) chemistry in N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> heterogeneous reactions on secondary nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) formation across the Korean Peninsula. The model results against aircraft measurements clearly showed significant Cl- underestimations due mainly to the high gas-particle (G/P) partitioning ratios at aircraft measurement altitudes such as 700-850\u00a0hPa, but the ClNO<sub>2</sub> simulations were reasonable. Several simulations of CMAQ-based sensitivity experiments against ground measurements indicated that although addition of Cl emission did not significantly alter NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation, the activated ClNO<sub>2</sub> chemistry with Cl emissions showed the best model performance with the reduced normalized mean bias (NMB) of 18.7\u00a0% compared to a value of 21.1\u00a0% for the Cl emissions-free case. In our model evaluation, ClNO<sub>2</sub> accumulated during the night but quickly produced Cl radical due to ClNO<sub>2</sub> photolysis at sunrise, which modulated other oxidation radicals (e.g., ozone [O<sub>3</sub>] and hydrogen oxide radicals [HO<sub>x</sub>]) in the early morning. In the morning hours (0800-1000 LST), the HO<sub>x</sub> were the dominant oxidants, contributing 86.6\u00a0% of the total oxidation capacity (sum of major oxidants such as O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sub>x</sub> species), while oxidability was enhanced by up to \u223c6.4\u00a0% (increase in 1\u00a0h HO<sub>x</sub> average of 2.89\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> molecules\u00b7cm<sup>-3</sup>) in the early morning mainly due to the changes in OH (+7.2\u00a0%), hydroperoxyl radical (HO<sub>2</sub>)(+10.0\u00a0%), and O<sub>3</sub> (+4.2\u00a0%) over the Seoul Metropolitan Area, during the KORUS-AQ campaign. Our results improve understanding of the atmospheric changes in the PM<sub>2.5</sub> formation pathway caused by ClNO<sub>2</sub> chemistry and Cl emissions over northeast Asia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
