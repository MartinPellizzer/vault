Conventional models are limited to depict the highly spatial- and time-varying patterns of ambient pollutant exposures at the community scale for megacities. Here, we developed a machine-learning approach that leverages the dynamic traffic profiles to continuously estimate community-level year-long air pollutant concentrations in Los Angeles, U.S. We found the introduction of real-world dynamic traffic data significantly improved the spatial fidelity of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>), and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) simulations by 47%, 4%, and 15%, respectively. We successfully captured PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels exceeding limits due to heavy traffic activities and providing an \"out-of-limit map\" tool to identify exposure disparities within highly polluted communities. In contrast, the model without real-world dynamic traffic data lacks the ability to capture the traffic-induced exposure disparities and significantly underestimate residents' exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The underestimations are more severe for disadvantaged communities such as black and low-income groups, showing the significance of incorporating real-time traffic data in exposure disparity assessment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1876-7990"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, P.
