Online observations of ambient O<sub>3</sub>, nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were conducted in southern Nanjing from July-September 2020 and April-May 2021. On this basis, the pollution characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> were analyzed. The O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> sensitivity and the transport influence of its precursors were further discussed using models. The frequency statistics of the daily maximum 8-hour moving average (DMA-8h O<sub>3</sub>) and hourly concentration (O<sub>3</sub>-1h) showed that O<sub>3</sub> pollution in southern Nanjing was more serious than that in urban areas. Three typical O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes were selected during the whole observation period, which included August 16<sup>th</sup>-27<sup>th</sup>, 2020; September 3<sup>rd</sup>-11<sup>th</sup>, 2020; and May 17<sup>th</sup>-25<sup>th</sup>, 2021. The O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> sensitivities in these three pollution episodes were analyzed using the observation-based model (OBM). The results of the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) and empirical kinetics modeling approach (EKMA) showed that the sensitivities of O<sub>3</sub> formation in the three pollution episodes were in the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regime, the transition regime, and the VOCs-limited regime, respectively. This difference in O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> sensitivity reflects that the site may have been influenced by transport. Therefore, the potential source contribution function (PSCF) and the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) method were further used to analyze the potential source areas of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, VOCs, and O<sub>3</sub> in these three pollution episodes. The results showed that there were obvious regional transport effects of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, VOCs, and O<sub>3</sub> in these three pollution episodes. The location of potential sources differed in these three pollution episodes, which were affected by the eastern cities of the Lishui site; the urban area of Nanjing and eastern area of Anhui Province; and the urban area of Nanjing and the middle of the YRD Region, respectively. The impact of transport on O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors also indicated the necessity of regional joint prevention and control of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the YRD Region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210018, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xin-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Joint Key Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Ambient Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Ambient Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210018, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Fang-Jian", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37694618", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202207171"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
