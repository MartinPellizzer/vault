Thirty-two C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group, O<sub>3</sub> group, O<sub>3</sub>+NAC group and NAC group. Mice were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> (1.0 ppm) or fresh air for 3 h on the day 1, day 3 and day 5, respectively. NAC (100 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally applied to the mice 1 h before each exposure. At 24 h after the 3-time exposure, the alveolar wall structure was severely damaged and the infiltrated inflammatory cells were apparent perivascularly and peribronchiolarly. Significant increases in the total white blood cell count, macrophage, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, as well as total protein concentration were observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P < 0.05). The IL-6, IL-8 (P < 0.01) and MDA levels (P < 0.05) in the lung homogenates were elevated coherently. Administration of NAC could attenuate the alveolar wall structure damage induced by O<sub>3</sub> exposure and reduce the amount of infiltrated inflammatory cells, total and differential leukocyte counts (P < 0.05), as well as the IL-6, IL-8 (P < 0.01) and MDA release (P < 0.05). Western blotting results showed that the O<sub>3</sub> exposure up-regulated the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB p65 protein expression in the lung tissue of mice (P < 0.05), which could be alleviated by NAC (P < 0.05). These\u00a0results\u00a0indicated that NAC could protect against O<sub>3</sub>-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. The beneficial effect of NAC might be related with the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB p65 signal pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qing-Zi", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Zhao-Di", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yu-Bo", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Li-Fen", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Tao", "Initials": "CT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China. lijianh@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Li Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "20730130R", "ISSNLinking": "0371-0874"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "interleukin-6, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WYQ7N0BPYC", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28004071"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
