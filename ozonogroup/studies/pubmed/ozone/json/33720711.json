Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and photochemically produced ozone. Urban VOC emission sources, including on-road transportation emissions, have decreased significantly over the past few decades through successful regulatory measures. These drastic reductions in VOC emissions have led to a change in the distribution of urban emissions and noncombustion sources of VOCs such as those from volatile chemical products (VCPs), which now account for a higher fraction of the urban VOC burden. Given this shift in emission sources, it is essential to quantify the relative contribution of VCP and mobile source emissions to urban pollution. Herein, ground site and mobile laboratory measurements of VOCs were performed. Two ground site locations with different population densities, Boulder, CO, and New York City (NYC), NY, were chosen in order to evaluate the influence of VCPs in cities with varying mixtures of VCPs and mobile source emissions. Positive matrix factorization was used to attribute hundreds of compounds to mobile- and VCP-dominated sources. VCP-dominated emissions contributed to 42 and 78% of anthropogenic VOC emissions for Boulder and NYC, respectively, while mobile source emissions contributed 58 and 22%. Apportioned VOC emissions were compared to those estimated from the Fuel-based Inventory of Vehicle Emissions and VCPs and agreed to within 25% for the bulk comparison and within 30% for more than half of individual compounds. The evaluated inventory was extended to other U.S. cities and it suggests that 50 to 80% of emissions, reactivity, and the SOA-forming potential of urban anthropogenic VOCs are associated with VCP-dominated sources, demonstrating their important role in urban U.S. air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NOAA Chemical Sciences
