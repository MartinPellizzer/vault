Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer with increasing incidence. Studies have linked air pollution exposure to various types of cancer, including leukemia and lymphoma, however, the relationship with multiple myeloma incidence has not been extensively investigated.", "We pooled four European cohorts (N\u00a0=\u00a0234,803) and assessed the association between residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and multiple myeloma. We applied Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders at the individual and area-level.", "During 4,415,817 person-years of follow-up (average 18.8 years), we observed 404 cases of multiple myeloma.
