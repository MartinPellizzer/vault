Fast response analyzers, based on heterogeneous chemiluminescence, need dye coated sensor discs on which the chemiluminescence is generated. In this study, we present three new preparation methods for those sensor discs. Currently available sensor discs exhibit a fast temporal decay of sensitivity, resulting in short duty times which is troublesome for many field applications. To produce sensor discs that provide more stable signals over time, three dyes and nine energy transfer reagents were tested (as well as different stoichiometric mixtures). The resulting optimal method saves 80% of the solid chemicals and shows a duty ozone dose that is prolonged by a factor of 3.5, revealing the same average sensitivity as currently available discs. In addition, we observed a strong effect of the adsorption matrix on the O(3) sensitivity, although silica discs from the same manufacturer were used. Application of the new sensor discs during field measurements showed that the results are consistent with the laboratory data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biogeochemistry Department, Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, P.O.
