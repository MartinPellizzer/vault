Therefore it is essential to obtain their global vertical distributions jointly with high precision and vertical resolution. There is little work on joint retrieval of air density and ozone distributions using the ultraviolet limb-scan technique, although much work has been done on ozone measurement. Numerical simulations of joint air density and ozone retrieval in the middle atmosphere (20-90 km) are carried out using limb-scattered radiances at four bands (255, 300, 320, and 340 nm). Results show that joint retrieval of dual parameters using the limb-scan technique is feasible with high precision in nearly the whole region concerned, where air density and ozone have a precision of 1%-2% and 3%-5%, respectively, provided that high measurement precision and accurate correction of multiple-scattered radiance at long ultraviolet bands are ensured."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100029 Beijing, China. guoxia@mail.iap.ac.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Daren", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17119603", "10.1364/ao.45.009021", "119040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
