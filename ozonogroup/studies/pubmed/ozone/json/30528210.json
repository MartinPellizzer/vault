Present study investigates the use of novel treatment approach of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) combined with chemical oxidation and catalyst for the degradation of Potassium Thiocyante (KSCN) for the first time. The effect of operating pressure (over the range of 2-5\u202fbar) and initial pH (over the range of 2-7.1) on the degradation has been studied initially. Effect of combination of HC with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (varying KSCN:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ratios as 1:0.5-1:3), HC\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub> (varying ozone mass flow rate over the range of 200-400\u202fmg/h), HC\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fcatalyst (TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO/CuO at fixed loading of 0.1\u202fg/L at optimized ozone flow rate) as process intensifying approaches on the KSCN degradation has also been studied. Combination of HC\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fCuO at different loadings of CuO has also been investigated. Use of combination of HC with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HC with Ozone resulted in extent of KSCN degradation as 73% and 71.1% respectively. Among the different combinations of HC\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fCatalysts (TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZnO/CuO), HC\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fCuO (at loading of 0.15\u202fg/l) resulted in highest KSCN degradation as 86.5%. Combination of HC\u202f+\u202fH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fCuO was established to be the best approach yielding complete degradation with synergistic index of 2.98 and 92.9% as the COD removal. The study also focused on establishing kinetic rate constants which revealed that all the approaches followed first order mechanism with higher rate constants for the combination approaches as compared to individual approach. Overall, it has been conclusively established that hydrodynamic cavitation based combined treatment schemes are very effective for the treatment of biorefractory wastewaters containing cyanide derivatives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
