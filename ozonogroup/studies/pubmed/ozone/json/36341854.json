Industries in surrounding areas, traffic and long-range transport of air pollution, can change with time and meteorology and so each national park should also have a historical database of the air quality in the site. This study reports surface measurements of ozone, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> acquired from March 2020 to July 2021 in \"Las Tablas de Daimiel\", a wetland Mediterranean National Park bordered by different cities and new industries in the field of the revalorization of agricultural wastes. Simultaneous data from a background station in a rural area isolated from air pollution are considered as reference. Twelve campaigns of one week duration were also performed to sample air in sorbent tubes to analyse volatile organic compounds from anthropogenic sources. Data are discussed considering meteorology, especially wind speed and direction together with the assessment of back-trajectories of air masses from distant sources. The results show that the effects of pollution from local and faraway sources on air quality in the park were weak. Thus, except for the high levels of ozone, with a mean value of 71 \u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup>, measured mass loadings for pollutants were low and not in exceedance of the air quality standards. Saharan dust events were frequent and contributed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in the site. NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> average concentrations (3.2 and 0.4 \u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively) were below the recommended critical levels for vegetation and all the quantified VOCs were found in average concentration levels below 0.5 \u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
