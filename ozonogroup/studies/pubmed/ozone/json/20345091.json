The concentrations of total suspended particles (TSPs) and other vapor-phase pollutants (CO and ozone) were monitored at Lulin, an atmospheric background station in central Taiwan in 2008. To evaluate the long-range transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during the Southeast Asia biomass burning event, the atmospheric polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) were also measured at Lulin station. The atmospheric PCDD/F and TSP concentrations measured at Lulin station ranged from 0.71-3.41 fg I-TEQ/m(3) and 5.32-55.6 microg/m(3), respectively, during the regular sampling periods. However, significantly higher concentrations of PCDD/Fs, TSPs, CO, and ozone were measured during the spring season. These high concentrations could be the result of long-range transport of the products of Southeast Asia biomass burning. During the Southeast Asia biomass burning event (March 18-24, 2008), an intensive observation program was also carried out at the same station. The results of this observation program indicated that the atmospheric PCDD/F concentration increased dramatically from 2.33 to 390 fg I-TEQ/m(3) (March 19, 2008). The trace gas (CO) of biomass burning also significantly increased to 232 ppb during the same period, while the particle-bound PCDD/Fs in the TSP increased from 28.7 to 109 pg I-TEQ/g-TSP at Lulin station during the burning event. We conclude that there was a significant increase in the PCDD/F concentration in ambient air at a high-altitude background station in central Taiwan during the Southeast Asia biomass burning event."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Central University, Chungli 320, Taiwan, Department of Chemistry, National Central University, Chungli 320, Taiwan. khchi@rcec.sinica.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Kai Hsien", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chuan-Yao", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chang-Feng Ou", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jia-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Neng-Heui", "Initials": "NH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheu", "ForeName": "Guey-Rong", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Chung-Te", "Initials": "CT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzofurans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Sci Technol. 2010 Aug 1;44(15):6006"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzofurans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20345091", "10.1021/es1000984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
