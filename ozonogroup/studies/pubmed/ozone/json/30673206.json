We recently devised a zero-energy zero-carbon biofiltration system easily applicable to activated sludge-type WWTPs and performed lab-scale proof-of-concept experiments. The major drawback of the system was the diminished performance observed when fully oxic gas streams were treated. Here, a serial biofiltration system was tested as a potential improvement. A laboratory system with three serially positioned biofilters, each receiving a separate feed of artificial wastewater, was fed N<sub>2</sub>O-containing gas streams of varied flow rates (200-2000 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (0-21%). Use of the serial setup substantially improved the reactor performance. Fed fully oxic gas at a flow rate of 1000 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>, the system removed N<sub>2</sub>O at an elimination capacity of 0.402 \u00b1 0.009 g N<sub>2</sub>O\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup> (52.5% removal), which was approximately 2.4-fold higher than that achieved with a single biofilter, 0.171 \u00b1 0.024 g N<sub>2</sub>O\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>. These data were used to validate the mathematical model developed to estimate the performance of the N<sub>2</sub>O biofiltration system. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency indices ranged from 0.78 to 0.93, confirming high predictability, and the model provided mechanistic insights into aerobic N<sub>2</sub>O removal and the performance enhancement achieved with the serial configuration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , KAIST , Daejeon , 34141 , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Hyun", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , KAIST , Daejeon , 34141 , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Min Joon", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , KAIST , Daejeon , 34141 , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Daehyun D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Northwestern University , Evanston , Illinois 60208 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sabba", "ForeName": "Fabrizio", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , KAIST , Daejeon , 34141 , Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9933-7054"], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Sukhwan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30673206", "10.1021/acs.est.8b05924"]}}]}
