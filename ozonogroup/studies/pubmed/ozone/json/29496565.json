We examined here whether NOS3 polymorphisms (rs2070744, 4b/4a VNTR, rs3918226 and rs1799983) and haplotypes affect the changes in blood pressure and NO bioavailability induced by propofol. Venous blood samples were collected from 168 patients at baseline and after 10\u00a0min of anesthesia with propofol 2 mg/kg administered intravenously by bolus injection. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and haplotype frequencies were estimated. Nitrite concentrations were measured by using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay, while NOx (nitrites\u00a0+\u00a0nitrates) levels were determined by using the Griess reaction. We found that CT\u00a0+\u00a0TT genotypes for the rs3918226 polymorphism, the ba\u00a0+\u00a0aa genotypes for the 4b/4a VNTR and the CTbT haplotype were associated with lower decreases in blood pressure and lower increases in nitrite levels after propofol anesthesia. On the other hand, the TCbT and CCbT haplotypes were associated with more intense decreases in blood pressure and higher increases in nitrite levels in response to propofol. Our results suggest that NOS3 polymorphisms and haplotypes influence the hypotensive responses to propofol, possibly by affecting NO bioavailability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
