However, the process of disinfection, essential to the protection of human health, generates deleterious by-products to both humans and the environment. This research aimed to evaluate the use of ozone as a disinfectant for wastewater treated by anaerobic/aerobic baffled reactor for later agricultural reuse. Disinfection tests were conducted by applying ozone, in batch, with applied dosages of 5, 8, and 10\u00a0mg\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> /L and contact time of 7\u00a0min. All the tests led to formaldehyde formation, therefore within the standard suggested by the World Health Organization. For the indicators total coliforms and Escherichia coli, the ozone was considered effective, satisfying the criteria for agricultural reuse according to the World Health Organization of a dosage of 8\u00a0mg\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> /L. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Proposal of decentralized system (anaerobic/aerobic baffled reactor\u00a0+\u00a0ozone disinfection) for effluent treatment for agricultural reuse. Formation of formaldehyde dependent on applied ozone dose. Demand of ozone consumed preferentially for the formation of by-products, with low removal of COD. High formaldehyde formation (high ozone demand) can impair the inactivation of pathogens. System promotes effluent that meets the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) for agricultural reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Water Environment Federation."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hydraulics and Sanitation, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (EESC-USP), S\u00e3o Carlos, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1767-3298"], "LastName": "Slompo", "ForeName": "Nathalie Dyane Miranda", "Initials": "NDM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Civil Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo State (FEB-UNESP), Bauru, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "da Silva", "ForeName": "Gustavo Henrique Ribeiro", "Initials": "GHR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2011/10816-2", "Agency": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2012/05297-9", "Agency": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "UNESP-S\u00e3o Paulo State University", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Civil/Environment Engineering Department", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31004526", "10.1002/wer.1128"]}}]}
