The projected increases result primarily from sustained growth in demand for refrigeration, air-conditioning (AC) and insulating foam products in developing countries assuming no new regulation of HFC consumption or emissions. New HFC scenarios are presented based on current hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) consumption in leading applications, patterns of replacements of HCFCs by HFCs in developed countries, and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Global HFC emissions significantly exceed previous estimates after 2025 with developing country emissions as much as 800% greater than in developed countries in 2050. Global HFC emissions in 2050 are equivalent to 9-19% (CO(2)-eq. basis) of projected global CO(2) emissions in business-as-usual scenarios and contribute a radiative forcing equivalent to that from 6-13 years of CO(2) emissions near 2050. This percentage increases to 28-45% compared with projected CO(2) emissions in a 450-ppm CO(2) stabilization scenario. In a hypothetical scenario based on a global cap followed by 4% annual reductions in consumption, HFC radiative forcing is shown to peak and begin to decline before 2050."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, PO Box 303, 3720 AH Bilthoven, The Netherlands. guus.velders@pbl.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Velders", "ForeName": "Guus J M", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fahey", "ForeName": "David W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daniel", "ForeName": "John S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McFarland", "ForeName": "Mack", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "Stephen O", "Initials": "SO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Energy Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "UNEP.
