The properties of the NM were initially characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Then, impact factors including NM dosage, ozone gas concentration and initial pH were investigated and the optimal conditions (i.e., NM dosage\u202f=\u202f3.5\u202fg/L, ozone gas concentration\u202f=\u202f300\u202fL/min, initial pH\u202f=\u202f6.8) were obtained in NM/O3 process. Besides, the superiority of the NM/O<sub>3</sub> process was confirmed by the experiments that the degradation efficiency of DMAC in the NM/O<sub>3</sub> process (i.e., 95.4%) was much higher than that in the zero-valent iron (ZVI)/O<sub>3</sub> process (i.e., 46.1%) and the synthetic FeS/O<sub>3</sub> process (i.e., 68.6%). Furthermore, the intermediate and possible degradation pathway of DMAC were proposed, and the biological toxicity of the intermediate was subsequently evaluated by the activated sludge. Finally, the mechanism of the NM/O3 process was proposed in this study based on control experiment and radical scavenging experiment. The extraordinary efficiency for DMAC degradation was found to be mainly caused by HO<sup>\u2022</sup> of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e., HO<sup>\u2022</sup>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) generated in the NM/O<sub>3</sub> process. Therefore, this study confirmed that NM was a high efficient catalyst for degradation the toxic and refractory pollutants in catalytic ozonation system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
