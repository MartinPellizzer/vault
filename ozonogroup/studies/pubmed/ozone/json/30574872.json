Descriptive statistics of the same variables during the study periods were recorded. Associations between variables were assessed using the paired-samples Wilcoxon test and categorical principal component analysis (CatPCA, SPSS24 package).", "The mean symptom score was low in 1996 and moderate in 2009. The 1996 and 2009 CatPCA analysis explained around 66.4% and 70.5% of the variance, respectively. The strongest relationships in 1996 were between symptoms and grass pollen counts (R=0.55) and between temperature and ozone (R=0.63). In 2009, the association between temperature and pollution-related variables was even stronger than in 1996 (ozone [R=0.53] and PM10 [R=0.34], with a positive sign in both cases).", "The effect of temperature and pollution (mainly ozone, even at lower atmospheric concentrations than in established guidelines for effects on health) may have contributed to the higher seasonal allergic rhinitis symptom score recorded in 2009."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consulta de Alergia Hospital Los Madro\u00f1os, Brunete, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cabrera", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unidad de Estad\u00edstica, Secretar\u00eda Adjunta de Inform\u00e1tica, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garz\u00f3n Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Ambiental, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreno Grau", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cl\u00ednica Subiza, Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subiza", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9107858", "ISSNLinking": "1018-9068"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health Surveillance"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symptom Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30574872", "10.18176/jiaci.0368"]}}]}
