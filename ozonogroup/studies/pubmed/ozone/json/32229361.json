The potential use of Th-T22 for diesel bioremediation in an artificial soil was tested by inoculating a diesel-sand mixture with a fungal mycelial suspension of Th-T22. Given the ability of ozone to degrade compounds with low biochemical reactivity, the effect of a pre- and post-ozonation was also evaluated. The survival, growth and sporulation of Th-T22 throughout the bioremediation trial were monitored in all the treatments. In the post-ozonation treatments, the biodegradation percentages of diesel removal were 70.16% and 88.35% in Th-T22-inoculated sand treated or untreated with the antibacterial streptomycin, respectively. The results showed that ozonation alone caused good removal efficiencies (41.9%) but it was much more effective if combined with Th-T22 in a post-ozonation regime, whereas pre-ozonation negatively affected the subsequent biodegradation, likely due to its disinfectant and oxidizing effect on Th-T22. The results obtained demonstrated the significant mycoremediation ability of Th-T22 in diesel-contaminated sand and its possible use as a bioremediation agent for diesel spills in polluted sites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
