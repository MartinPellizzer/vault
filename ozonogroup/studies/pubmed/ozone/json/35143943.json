Its use is, however, dose-restricted due to nephrotoxicity. We planned to compare the nephroprotective effects of three major compounds, including melatonin (MN), Ozone, or vitamin E, against the CP-induced renal damage in rats. CP was given once intraperitoneally (10\u00a0mg/kg,) eliciting acute kidney injury as assured by several adverse histological changes; glomerulopathy, tubulopathy, and vasculopathy, an inflammatory response including elevated TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. Furthermore, biochemical alterations including, elevated plasma levels of urea, uric acid, creatinine, phosphorous, decreased plasma calcium levels, and gene expression abnormalities; upregulation of N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) and Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), downregulation of CAT and SOD. Concurrent supplementation with either MN (10\u00a0mg/kg per os) or Ozone (1.1\u00a0mg/kg ip) and Vit E given by oral gavage (1\u00a0g/kg) for five consecutive days prior to CP injection and five days afterward displayed variable significant nephroprotective effects by mitigating the pro-inflammatory secretion, augmenting antioxidant competence, and modulating the gene expression in the renal tissue. The obtained biochemical, histological, and gene expression data suggested that MN had foremost rescue effects followed by Ozone then Vit E. MN's ameliorative effect was augmented in many indices including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 , IL1-\u03b2, uric acid, creatinine, sNGAL and GGT, more than observed in Ozone, and Vit E therapy. A combination of these medications is expected to be more useful in relieving the damaging renal effects of CP given to cancer patients, pending further toxicological and pharmacological research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
