Studies have explored this evolution (so-called OA aging) in the atmosphere, but none have investigated it indoors. Aging organic molecules in both particle and gas-phases undergo changes in oxygen content and volatility, which may ultimately either enhance or reduce the condensed-phase OA concentration (C<sub>OA</sub> ). This work models OH-induced aging using the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) within an indoor model and explores its significance on C<sub>OA</sub> relative to prior modeling methodologies which neglect aging transformations. Lagrangian, time-averaged, and transient indoor simulations were conducted. The time-averaged simulations included a Monte Carlo procedure and sensitivity analysis, using input distributions typical of U.S. residences. Results demonstrate that indoors, aging generally leads to C<sub>OA</sub> augmentation. The extent to which this is significant is conditional upon several factors, most notably temperature, OH exposure, and OA mass loading. Time-averaged C<sub>OA</sub> was affected minimally in typical residences (<5% increase). However, some plausible cases may cause stronger C<sub>OA</sub> enhancements, such as in a sunlit room where photolysis facilitates significant OH production (~20% increase), or during a transient OH-producing cleaning event (~35% peak increase)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
