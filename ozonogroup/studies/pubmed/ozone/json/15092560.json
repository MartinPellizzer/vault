The optimum design is dependent on the values of the Weibull model parameters. A transformation was developed which allowed the optimum design (by the determinant criterion) for one parametric situation to be translated to any other, and permitted the search for optimum designs to be restricted to one set of Weibull parameters. Optimum designs were determined for the case where the Weibull parameters are assumed known, and effects of deviating from the optimum designs were investigated. Several alternative design strategies were considered for protecting against incorrectly guessing the Weibull model parameters when their true values are not known."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Statistics Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-8203, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dassel", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rawlings", "ForeName": "J O", "Initials": "JO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092560", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90044-9", "0269749188900449"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
