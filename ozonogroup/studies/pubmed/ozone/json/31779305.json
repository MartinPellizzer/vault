However, implementation of SiGe in nanoscale electronic devices necessitates suppression of surface states dominating the electronic properties. The absence of a stable and passive surface oxide for SiGe results in the formation of charge traps at the SiGe-oxide interface induced by GeO<sub><i>x</i></sub>. In an ideal ALD process in which oxide is grown layer by layer, the GeO<sub><i>x</i></sub> formation should be prevented with selective surface oxidation (i.e., formation of an SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub> interface) by controlling the oxidant dose in the first few ALD cycles of the oxide deposition on SiGe. However, in a real ALD process, the interface evolves during the entire ALD oxide deposition due to diffusion of reactant species through the gate oxide. In this work, this diffusion process in nonideal ALD is investigated and exploited: the diffusion through the oxide during ALD is utilized to passivate the interfacial defects by employing ozone as a secondary oxidant. Periodic ozone exposure during gate oxide ALD on SiGe is shown to reduce the integrated trap density (<i>D</i><sub>it</sub>) across the band gap by nearly 1 order of magnitude in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (<6 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) and in HfO<sub>2</sub> (<3.9 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) by forming a SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-rich interface on SiGe. Depletion of Ge from the interfacial layer (IL) by enhancement of volatile GeO<sub><i>x</i></sub> formation and consequent desorption from the SiGe with ozone insertion during the ALD growth process is confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) and hypothesized to be the mechanism for reduction of the interfacial defects. In this work, the nanoscale mechanism for defect suppression at the SiGe-oxide interface is demonstrated, which is engineering of diffusion species in the ALD process due to facile diffusion of reactant species in nonideal ALD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Engineering , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , California 92093 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0643-4964"], "LastName": "Kavrik", "ForeName": "Mahmut Sami", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Light Source (ALS) , E.
