The highest mutagenicity was observed after chlorination, while hydrogen peroxide-ozone-chlorine treatment produced the lowest value for both waters. Chlorinated waters, which were spiked with bromide, had up to 3.7 times more mutagenic activity than waters without bromide after every preoxidation method. 3-Chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) was found to correspond as much as 76% of the overall mutagenicity in the waters not spiked with bromide. MX formation was found to be lower when the treated water contained bromide, implicating the formation of brominated MX analogues. Trihalomethane formation increased when the treated water contained bromide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health, National Public Health Institute, PO Box 95, FIN-70701 Kuopio, Finland. tiia.myllykangas@ktl.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myllykangas", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nissinen", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00e4ki-Paakkanen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirvonen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vartiainen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14333-13-2", "NameOfSubstance": "permanganic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "77439-76-0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["13129514", "10.1016/S0045-6535(03)00535-6", "S0045-6535(03)00535-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
