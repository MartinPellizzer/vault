Open-top chamber charcoal filtered air treatments were compared with non-filtered treatments for field-grown wheat. 30 experiments meeting requirements were found, representing nine countries in North America, Europe and Asia. 26 experiments reported improved yield and 4 experiments reduced yield by filtration, a significant positive effect. Average yield improvement was 9%. Average daytime [O(3)] was reduced by filtration from 35 to 13\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol(-1). Filtration efficiency was 63% for O(3) and 56% for SO(2). For NO(x) it was observed that NO(2) was reduced and NO increased by filtration. Thus, filters convert NO(2) to NO. Most experiments reported low or very low [SO(2)] and [NO(x)]. Thus, O(3) can be concluded to be the main phytotoxic component in the experiments. Elevated [NO(2)] was observed in one experiment. The conclusion is that current [O(3)] over large parts of the world adversely affect wheat yield."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
