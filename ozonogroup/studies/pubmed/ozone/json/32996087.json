Given the limited resources and environmental impacts of agricultural activities on human health, it is necessary to determine an appropriate cropping pattern. The present research aimed to maximize net profit and minimize environmental impacts, including the releases of carcinogens, noncarcinogens, ozone layer depletion, ionizing radiation, and respiratory inorganics and organics on human health. In this study, an optimal cropping pattern of irrigated and rainfed crops was proposed for the east of Lorestan Province using multi-objective nonlinear programming (MOP). Results showed that the cropping areas of chickpea, rapeseed, and potatoes decreased by 50% in the irrigated crop of MOP model and that of lentil in the MOP model of rainfed crops compared with the current pattern. Another important result was increases in the cropping areas of lentil and bean in the MOP pattern of irrigated crops and wheat in the rainfed MOP model. The environmental impacts of agricultural sector on human health can be reduced by determining an optimal cropping pattern. The implementation of this model in the region reduced the emissions of carcinogens (4%), noncarcinogens (9%), respiratory inorganics (17%), ionizing radiation (14%), ozone layer depletion (17%), and respiratory organics (15%) compared with the existing situation along with an increased net profit of $968,483. According to the findings, consideration of environmental objectives affecting human health is essential in the optimization of the cropping pattern. In addition to optimal use of water and land resources, using the proposed model helps to increase profits and reduce environmental consequences on human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Agroecology, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Marzban", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Agroecology, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran. m_asgharipour@uoz.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Asgharipour", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Agroecology, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghanbari", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Agroecology, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramroudi", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Agroecology, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Seyedabadi", "ForeName": "Esmaeel", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "9517-8", "Agency": "University of Zabol", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ali M, Geng Y, Robins D, Cooper D, Roberts W (2019) Impact assessment of energy utilization in agriculture for India and Pakistan.
