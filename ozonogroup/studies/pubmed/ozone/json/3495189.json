Children were selected to obtain three equal-sized groups: one without respiratory symptoms, one with symptoms of persistent wheeze, and one with cough or phlegm production but without persistent wheeze. Parents completed a daily diary of symptoms from which illness constellations of upper respiratory illness (URI) and lower respiratory illness (LRI) and the symptom of wheeze were derived. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured daily for nine consecutive weeks during the eight-month study period. Maximum hourly concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and coefficient of haze for each 24-hour period, as well as minimum hourly temperature, were correlated with daily URI, LRI, wheeze, and PEFR using multiple regression models adjusting for illness occurrence or level of PEFR on the immediately preceding day. Respiratory illness on the preceding day was the most important predictor of current illness. A drop in temperature was associated with increased URI and LRI but not with increased wheeze or with a decrease in level of PEFR. No air pollutant was strongly associated with respiratory illness or with level of PEFR, either in the group of children as a whole, or in either of the symptomatic subgroups; the pollutant concentrations observed, however, were uniformly lower than current ambient air quality standards. Moreover, since exposure estimation based on monitoring of ambient air likely results in misclassification of the true exposure, the negative findings of this study must be interpreted cautiously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vedal", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schenker", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Munoz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samet", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Batterman", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Speizer", "ForeName": "F E", "Initials": "FE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "5 K04 HL00951", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "7427", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "1254074", "ISSNLinking": "0090-0036"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Flow Rates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pennsylvania"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Int J Biometeorol. 1965 Dec;9(3):239-51", "ArticleIdList": ["5888434"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1971 Sep;94(3):269-79", "ArticleIdList": ["5093655"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Biometeorol. 1977 Mar;21(1):7-15", "ArticleIdList": ["852920"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Biometeorol. 1978 Dec;22(4):263-70", "ArticleIdList": ["750506"]}, {"Citation": "Biometrics. 1979 Dec;35(4):795-802", "ArticleIdList": ["526525"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health. 1980 Jul;70(7):687-96", "ArticleIdList": ["7386702"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health. 1983 Jan;73(1):50-6", "ArticleIdList": ["6847999"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1984 Feb;33(1):130-43", "ArticleIdList": ["6692807"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1983 Nov-Dec;38(6):325-30", "ArticleIdList": ["6607712"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1986 Mar-Apr;41(2):104-8", "ArticleIdList": ["3487290"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3495189", "PMC1647061", "10.2105/ajph.77.6.694"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
