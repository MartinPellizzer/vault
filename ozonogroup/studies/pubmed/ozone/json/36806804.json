We collected source water samples (n\u00a0=\u00a020) originating from the Hanshui River and the Yangtze River of Wuhan section, treated water samples (n\u00a0=\u00a020), and tap water samples (n\u00a0=\u00a0169) in Wuhan, Central China during 2019 for determination of twelve triazine herbicides and their eight derivatives (collectively defined as TZs) and characterizing their fate during water treatment. Eighteen of the twenty TZs were detected in the source water. Atrazine (ATZ) had the highest concentrations (median: 22.4\u00a0ng/L) in the source water samples while DACT had the highest concentrations (median: 31.4\u00a0ng/L) in the treated water. \"Tryns\" (ametryn, prometryn, simetryn, terbutryn) were efficiently removed by conventional water treatment, while other target analytes were not; interestingly, hydroxypropazine and prometon increased significantly accompanied by prometryn disappearance, which implicated potential transformation pathways. In addition, \"tryns\" might be transformed into \"tons\" (atraton, prometon, secbumeton, terbumeton) by ozonation. In the tap water samples, diaminochlorotriazine had the highest concentrations (median: 34.9\u00a0ng/L) among the target analytes, followed by ATZ (18.3\u00a0ng/L), hydroxyatrazine (5.17\u00a0ng/L), deethylatrazine (5.00\u00a0ng/L), hydroxypropazine (3.20\u00a0ng/L), deisopropylatrazine (2.05\u00a0ng/L), hydroxydesethylatrazine (1.68\u00a0ng/L), and others. The TZs had the highest cumulative concentration in July in the tap water samples (median: 89.7\u00a0ng/L). This study found that ozonation in combination with activated carbon was more efficient in removing triazine herbicides, although \"tryns\" could also be transformed during conventional treatment. Ecological risk assessment showed moderate risks posed by hydroxyterbuthylazine, prometryn, and simetryn; the Hanshui River had higher risks than the Yangtze River, and July had higher risks than February. Human exposure to the TZs via water ingestion was low compared to the reference doses. This study characterized the occurrence of some new emerging TZs in the source water, their fate during drinking water treatment, and their seasonal variability in the tap water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
