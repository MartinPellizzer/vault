The aim is to apply this novel method to differentiate the behavior between rural and urban regions when it comes to the ozone dynamics. To do so, some centrality parameters of the resulting complex networks have been investigated: the degree, betweenness and shortest path. Some of them are expected to corroborate previous works in order to support the use of this technique; while others to supply new information. Results coincide when describing the difference that tropospheric ozone exhibits seasonally and geographically. It is seen that ozone behavior is fractal, in accordance to previous works. Also, it has been demonstrated that this methodology is able to characterize the divergence encountered between measurements in urban environments and countryside. In addition to that, the promising outcomes of this technique support the use of complex networks for the study of air pollutants dynamics. Particularly, new nuances are offered such as the identification and description of singularities in the signal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
