Only at 0.10 microl litre(-1) was biomass production reduced and related to leaf loss rather than leaf formation, since the latter was similar in all treatments. Stem length at 0.10 microl litre(-1) approached that of the control, whereas starch concentration in the green stem bark tended to be reduced, as were the ratios of stem weight/length and root/shoot biomass. The changes in carbon allocation and biomass production gradually became established during the second half of the growing season. At the altered carbon allocation at 0.10 microl litre(-1), the ratio of whole-plant production/attached foliage area resembled that of the other O(3) regimes. However, the latter ratio was strongly reduced at 0.10 microl litre(-1) when calculated on the basis of the potential foliage area, as compensated for the O(3)-induced leaf loss. Thus the carbon return/cost balance of the totally formed foliage was low, although the relative-growth rate of ozonated plants temporarily reached that of the control. The relation between leaf differentiation under ozonation (lowered stomatal density) and whole-plant production remains uncertain. The plant behavior found is discussed in terms of passive response or acclimatization to O(3) stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow, and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstr. 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcnthardt-Goerg", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Landolt", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091806", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90203-z", "026974919390203Z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
