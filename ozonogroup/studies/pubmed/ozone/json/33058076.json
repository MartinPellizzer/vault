In the present study, microplasma was employed to reduce the pesticide content in water. The degradation efficacy, rate, and pathways of standard organophosphorus pesticides (namely, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos oxone, and diazinone) and an organochlorine pesticide (namely, DDT solution) were evaluated using microplasma. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed to elucidate the degradation efficiency of pesticides as a function of plasma-produced substances that originally contributed to the main reduction procedure. Microplasma produces several types of radicals or reactive substances, for instance dissolved ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen oxides, hydroxyl radicals (OH radicals), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The removal potential differs due to the existence or absence of varieties of plasma-produced substances. The functions of major plasma-produced species on pesticide removal were determined by a passive technique. Nitrogen oxides showed a key role in organophosphorus pesticide removal, whereas dissolved ozone and OH radicals played major roles in DDT degradation. HPLC data showed that plasma-induced pesticide removal showed first-order reaction kinetics. The pesticide removal pathways through microplasma were validated by investigating the achieved data from LC-MS and GC-MS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety and Hygiene Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, 55365, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Muhammad Saiful Islam", "Initials": "MSI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety and Hygiene Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, 55365, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Na Ri", "Initials": "NR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety and Hygiene Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, 55365, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Jaehwan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety and Hygiene Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, 55365, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ji Young", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety and Hygiene Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, 55365, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jong Hoon", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety and Hygiene Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, 55365, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Ki Hyun", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Safety and Hygiene Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, 55365, Republic of Korea. yunji@kfri.re.kr."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-350, Republic of Korea. yunji@kfri.re.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yun-Ji", "Initials": "YJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "E0192103", "Agency": "Korea Food Research Institute", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Barros A, Pizzolato T, Carissimi E, Schneider I (2006) Decolorizing dye wastewater from the agate industry with Fenton oxidation process.
