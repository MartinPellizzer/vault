Microorganisms are the main drivers of soil ecological processes, however, the link between soil microbial communities and ecological functions under elevated ozone remains poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the responses of three crop seedlings (i.e., soybean, maize, and wheat) growth and soil microbial communities to elevated ozone (40\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub> above ambient air) in a pot experiment in the solardomes. Results showed that elevated ozone adversely affected ecosystem multifunctionality by reducing crop biomass, inhibiting soil extracellular enzyme activities, and altering nutrient availability. Elevated ozone increased bacterial and fungal co-occurrence network complexity, negatively correlated with ecosystem multifunctionality. Changes in the relative abundance of some specific bacteria and fungi were associated with multiple ecosystem functioning. In addition, elevated ozone significantly affected fungal community composition but not bacterial community composition and microbial alpha-diversity. Crop type played a key role in determining bacterial alpha-diversity and microbial community composition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that short-term elevated ozone could lead to a decrease in ecosystem multifunctionality associated with changes in the complexity of microbial networks in soils."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
