Wastewater treatment using an ionized gas from plasma has been actively progressing. The ionized gas involves reactive species such as O2+, O2- cluster, O radical and OH radical. Since the ionized gas method has such outstanding characteristics as relatively simple structures, non-calorification, non-toxicity and low electricity consumption, it evidently of interest as a new process. A series of experiments were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of ionized gas as a useful element for the diminution of nondegradable organic matters. On the other hand, a large amount of organic matters were changed to hydrophilic and the compounds containing aromatic functional group gradually decreased. The results implied that the ionized gas has been able to degrade the non-biodegradable organic matters. Therefore, the oxidation process by using an ionized gas process could be considered as an effective alternative unit in water and wastewater treatment plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Kongju National University, 182, Shinkwan-dong, Kongju, Chungnam 314-701, Korea. lejcmk@kongju.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Eun Ju", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Paul Gene", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwak", "ForeName": "Dong Heui", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Lee Hyung", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Min Jeong", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Domestic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20651452", "10.2166/wst.2010.267"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
