It also has the capacity to stimulate blood circulation and the immune response. Such features justify the current interest in its application in medicine and dentistry and have been indicated for the treatment of 260 different pathologies. It can be used for the treatment of alveolitis as a replacement for antibiotic therapy, as a mouthwash for reducing the oral microflora, as well as the adherence of microorganisms to tooth surfaces. Ozone has been shown to stimulate remineralization of recent caries-affected teeth after a period of about six to eight weeks.", "The future of ozone therapy must focus on the establishment of safe and well-defined parameters in accordance with randomized, controlled trials to determine the precise indications and guidelines in order to treat various medical and dental pathologies. Scientific support, as suggested by demonstrated studies, for ozone therapy presents a potential for an atraumatic, biologically-based treatment for conditions encountered in dental practice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. cgn173@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nogales", "ForeName": "Carlos Goes", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferrari", "ForeName": "Patr\u00edcia Helena", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kantorovich", "ForeName": "Efraim Olszewer", "Initials": "EO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lage-Marques", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Luiz", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Contemp Dent Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101090552", "ISSNLinking": "1526-3711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hematologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations, Dental"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hematologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations, Dental"}], "NumberOfReferences": "26"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18473030", "1526-3711-517"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
