The UV-excited ozone gas was generated by UV irradiation of highly concentrated ozone gas. During the UV-excited ozone process, UV light irradiates the sample surface directly through the ozone gas. Then, the temperature at the sample surface is increased by UV-light absorption at the surface. Estimation of this surface temperature is important for understanding the oxidation mechanism. We estimated the surface temperature obtained during UV irradiation to be about 300 degrees C by investigating the temperature dependence of the oxidation rate for oxygen gas. We have previously determined that almost no thermal decomposition of ozone gas occurs at this temperature, and that oxygen gas does not oxidize the Si substrate. Therefore, we concluded that the only oxidation species in the UV-excited ozone process is UV-excited ozone O((1)D)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meidensha Corporation, Numazu, Shizuoka 410-8588, Japan. n-kameda@aist.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kameda", "ForeName": "Naoto", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishiguchi", "ForeName": "Tetsuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morikawa", "ForeName": "Yoshiki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kekura", "ForeName": "Mitsuru", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Ken", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ushiyama", "ForeName": "Tomoharu", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nonaka", "ForeName": "Hidehiko", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ichimura", "ForeName": "Shingo", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Anal Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8511078", "ISSNLinking": "0910-6340"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20145332", "10.2116/analsci.26.273", "JST.JSTAGE/analsci/26.273"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
