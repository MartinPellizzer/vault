Continuous measurements of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and meteorological data were also made at this site. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the resulting 15 variables showed that the ambient mercury in Rochester was primarily produced by non-local sources in contrast to earlier studies that showed that local sources were present. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the atmospheric mercury and other pollutant species concentrations showed that transport and atmospheric processes have become the major source of mercury in Rochester. Conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF) and potential source contribution function (PSCF) were used to identify local and distant mercury sources. The results in this study showed that the closure of a coal-fired power plant and promulgation of several fuel quality policies reduced local mercury emissions making long-distance transport the major source of mercury in Rochester."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
