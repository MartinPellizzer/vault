Plants are exposed to UV-B and other xenobiotics simultaneously in today's industrialized world. The present studies were undertaken to see the effect of dual stress of UV-B and Cd2+ exposure on the growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings. The plants grown in 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 ppm Cd2+-supplemented medium were exposed to UV-B for 30 min (2 J, 0.4 mW/cm(2)) per day. After 5 and 10 days of treatment the combined stress of UV-B and Cd2+ resulted in reduction of biomass yield, growth, and chlorophyll content and changes in protein, free amino acid, starch, and total reducing sugar content. These data support the assumption that UV-B may have a regulatory role besides damaging effects and that an increased UV-B environment will likely increase this regulatory influence of UV-B radiation. The results also indicate that the adverse effects of one stress may be modulated in the presence of other stresses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Toxicology Research Center, Lucknow 226 001, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Umesh C", "Initials": "UC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Prakash C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kakkar", "ForeName": "Poonam", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment, Controlled"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11886182", "10.1006/eesa.2001.2136", "S0147651301921360"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
