BALB/c mice were exposed to ozone (1 part per million (ppm)) for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. They were examined with plethysmography and with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 24 h later. The BAL fluid was analysed for the presence of inflammatory cells and concentrations of proteins and phospholipids. Surfactant in the remaining BAL fluid was concentrated five-times and examined with a capillary surfactometer (CS). The surfactant was then washed with a large volume of saline solution which was removed following centrifugation. Already, after a 2 h ozone exposure, the respiratory frequency increased from 297+/-6 to 386+/-11 breaths x min(-1) (p<0.0001). Pressure amplitude per breath diminished (p<0.001), indicating a reduced tidal volume. A highly significant surfactant dysfunction was observed with the CS (p<0.0001), although phospholipids increased. However, proteins also increased (p<0.0001) and they or other water-soluble inhibitors apparently caused the surfactant dysfunction since, when they were removed with a washing procedure, the surfactant's normal ability to maintain patency was restored. The acute ozone exposure affected breathing and caused an airway inflammation. The inflammatory proteins or other water-soluble inhibitors reduced the surfactant's ability to secure airway patency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept of Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Currie", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Schaik", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Enhorning", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL 49971", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography, Whole Body"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9727776", "10.1183/09031936.98.12020288"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
