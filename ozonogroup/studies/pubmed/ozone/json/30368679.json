We conducted a time-series study to explore the association between ambient temperature and daily hospital admissions for RHD in Shanghai, China. We collected data on daily hospital admissions for RHD from 2013 to 2015 from the database of Shanghai Health Insurance System. We applied the generalized additive models together with the distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate the association between temperature and RHD hospital admissions after controlling for relative humidity, time trend, day of the week, and holidays. Stratification analyses by age and gender were performed to evaluate their potential effect modification. A total of 4178 cases of RHD hospitalizations were identified over the study period. There were almost linear, positive, and significant associations between daily mean temperature and RHD hospital admissions with higher risks at hotter days. Compared to reference temperature (0\u00a0\u00b0C), the cumulative risks of moderate heat (the 90th percentile of temperature, 28.0\u00a0\u00b0C) and extreme heat (the 99th percentile of temperature, 33.5\u00a0\u00b0C) over lags 0-5\u00a0days were 2.55 (95% confidence interval 1.14, 5.73) and 3.22 (95% confidence interval 1.36, 7.61), respectively. These associations were significantly stronger in older people than in younger people. This study indicated larger risks of RHD hospital admissions associated with higher temperature, especially in older people. Our findings provided first-hand epidemiological evidence regarding the effects of ambient temperature on RHD incidence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and NHC Key Laboratory of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University, P.O.
