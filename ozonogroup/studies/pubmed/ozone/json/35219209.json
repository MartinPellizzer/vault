The effect of two experimental parameters (temperature and ozone application mode) on the pesticide degradation was evaluated. The results showed that solarization (S), solarization with surface ozonation (SOS), and solarization with deep ozonation (SOD) enhanced pesticide degradation rates in comparison with the control (untreated soil, C). The triazole, anilinopyrimidine, strobilurin and neonicotinoid pesticides showed similar behaviour under S and SOS conditions. The highest decrease was found in SOD, indicating the significant effect of temperature and ozone application mode on the efficiency of the ozonation treatment. Thus, a higher soil temperature and a longer accumulated time at high temperature in treatments S, SOS and SOD were observed due to solarization process. In addition, the removal efficiency was enhanced with exposure time. Finally, the main 15 transformation products were identified during SOD treatment. The results suggest that solarization combined with ozonation techniques allows decontamination of soil containing pesticide residues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
