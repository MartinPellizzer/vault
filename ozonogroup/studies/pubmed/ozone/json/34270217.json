Catalytic performance, mass transfer, and mechanical strength are the key elements for large-scale applications of catalysts. To optimize those elements, Fe was selected for its dual role in graphitization and catalytic ozonation. A Fe/N-doped micron-scale carbon-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> framework (CAF) was designed and applied to a fluidized catalytic process for the treatment of secondary effluent from coal gasification. The chemical oxygen demand removal rate constant and the hydroxyl radical generation efficiency (<i>R</i><sub>ct</sub>) of the Fe/N-doped CAF were 190% and 429% higher than those of pure ozone, respectively. Theoretical calculations revealed that higher Fe valence promoted ozone decomposition, which implied increasing Fe<sup>III</sup> content for further catalyst optimization. The rate constant and <i>R</i><sub>ct</sub> with a higher Fe<sup>III</sup>-proportion catalyst were increased by 13% and 16%, respectively, compared to those with the lower one. Molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations were performed to analyze the reaction kinetics qualitatively and quantitatively. The energy barrier corresponding to Fe<sup>III</sup> configuration was 1.32 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, 27% lower than that for Fe<sup>II</sup> configuration. These theoretical calculations guided the catalyst optimization and provided a novel solution for designing ozonation catalysts. The Fe/N-doped CAF demonstrated a great potential for practical applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Changpei", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Biological Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Kajia", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4076-1464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Laboratory on Low Carbon Clean Energy Innovation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6869-1459"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 1H9, Canada."}], "LastName": "Gamal El-Din", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3196-3443"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Laboratory on Low Carbon Clean Energy Innovation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoyuan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "20"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["34270217", "10.1021/acs.est.1c00728"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
