This is potentially relevant for people travelling to and competing in the Olympic and Paralympic Games (OPG) in Paris. We describe anticipated air quality in Paris based on historical monitoring data and describe the impact of the process on the development of monitoring strategies for future international sporting events.", "Air pollutant data for July to September 2020-2023 and pollen data for 2015-2022 were provided by Airparif (particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)) and RNSA stations in the Paris region. Airparif's street-level numerical modelling provided spatial data for the OPG venues.", "The maximum daily mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 11\u00b16\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> at traffic stations, below the WHO recommended daily air quality threshold (AQT). Daily NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations ranged from 5\u00b13\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> in rural areas to 17\u00b114\u2009\u00b5gm<sup>3</sup> in urban areas. Near traffic stations, this rose to 40\u00b124\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> exceeding the WHO AQT. Both peaked around 06:00 and 20:00 UTC (coordinated universal time). The ambient O<sub>3</sub> level exceeded the AQT on 20 days per month and peaked at 14:00 UTC. The main allergenic taxa from June to September was Poaceae (ie, grass pollen variety).", "Air pollutant levels are expected to be within accepted air quality thresholds at the Paris OPG. However, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations may be significantly raised in very hot and clear conditions and grass pollen levels will be high, prompting a need to consider and manage this risk in susceptible individuals."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.
