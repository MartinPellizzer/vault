However, little information is available for pitaya fruit.", "Ozone treatment significantly reduced the decay rate and induced the enzyme activities of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase, and also reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species. In total, 103 metabolites were detected and changed the content after ozone treatment, including 54 primary metabolites and 49 aromatic compounds. After significance and importance analysis, 37 metabolites were important. Some metabolites were induced by peel senescence to respond to senescence stress, including d-fructose, d-glucose, mannose, inositol, galactonic acid, ethanedioic acid and stearic acid. Some metabolic products of peel senescence were reduced by ozone treatment, including d-arabinose, glucaric acid, galacturonic acid, 1-hexanol, 4-ethylcyclohexanol, \u03b2-linalool, palmitoleic acid and 2-hydroxy-cyclopentadecanone. Some metabolites induced by ozone treatment might play a vital role in delaying the senescence and decay, including malic acid, succinic acid, pentenoic acid, eicosanoic acid, 2-hexenal, hexanal, 2-heptenal, 4-heptenal, 2-octenal and nitro m-xylene.", "Ozone treatment significantly reduced decay and prolonged shelf-life without reducing fruit quality.
