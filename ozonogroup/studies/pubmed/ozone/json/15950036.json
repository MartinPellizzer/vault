For this purpose, we used data sets collected from a total of 31 air quality monitoring stations dispersed across the Seoul metropolitan city between 1990 and 2000. In the case of NO(2), the frequency of hourly exceedance data sets exhibited little changes in the early 90s. However, it increased dramatically after 1995, probably in compliance with a rapid increase in the total number of automobiles. Likewise, the daily exceedance of O(3) in the early 90s was not significant, approaching 100 cases (except in 1994). However, its total quantity began to surpass 300 cases since around 1996. Comparison of those exceedance data was also made among spatially divided data groups. In the case of NO(2), the occurrence of exceedance data was dominated by the western part of the city in both magnitude and frequency. On the other hand, that for O(3) was characterized by notably strong occurrences in the eastern counterpart. The overall results of our analysis of the NO(2) and O(3) exceedance data sets indicate an inextricable linkage between the two pollutants in association with geographical and meteorological factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Sejong University, Goon Ja Dong 98, Gwang Jin Goo, Seoul 143-747, Republic of Korea. khkim@sejong.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ki-Hyun", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Ye-Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Min-Young", "Initials": "MY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15950036", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.12.067", "S0045-6535(05)00079-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
