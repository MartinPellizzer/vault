The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at pH 7.0 and ambient temperature (25 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C). Results indicate that under the applied experimental conditions, more than 95% of chlorobenzilate, etridiazole, alachlor, butachlor, metolachlor, propachlor, atrazine, simazine, aldicarb, oxamyl and methiocarb could be effectively removed by UV254; and the removal efficiencies of other pesticides were in a range of 12.9%-77.7%. Ozone could completely degrade chloroneb, dichlorvos, bromacil, aldicarb, carbaryl, carbofuran, oxamyl and methiocarb; prometon and aldicarb sulfone were resistant to ozonation; and the removal efficiencies of other pesticides varied from 19.0% to 93.1%. Permanganate could fully degrade dichlorvos, aldicarb and methiocarb; organochlorines, dinitroanaline, thiadiazole, acetamides and other carbamates were resistant to permanganate oxidation; and the removal efficiencies of other pesticides ranged from 16.0% to 88.2%. If the practical dosage applied in drinking water treatment is considered, it is expected that most of the pesticides will be completely degraded by ozone, a few by permanganate, but probably none by UV254 ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China. cnchaoliu@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiang", "ForeName": "Zhi-min", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14333-13-2", "NameOfSubstance": "permanganic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19353869"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
