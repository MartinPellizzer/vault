Using open-top chamber technology, bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Bergamo) were exposed for 21 d (from emergence) to four different atmospheres characterized by average daylight O3 concentrations of 12, 70, 89 and 109nL L<sup>-1</sup>. Rubisco-SSU extracted from primary leaves was fixed specifically on wells coated with anti-SSU antibodies. Aldehydes and ketones, previously derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP), were quantified with anti-DNP antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. A significant positive O3 effect on carbonyl formation was detected, and the number of carbonyls was found to be linearly increased (r<sup>2</sup>=0.82) when plotted against increasing external O3 dose expressed as accumulated exposure over a threshold of 40 nL L<sup>-1</sup> h (AOT40). Furthermore, these O3-induced oxidative modifications were connected with a significant reduction in the amount of native SSU that linearly decreased (r<sup>2</sup>=0.95) as AOT40 increased from 0 to about 8295 nL L<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> h. A possible pathway leading to oxidation of Rubisco is proposed, with special reference to O3 reactivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'Ecologie Mol\u00e9culaire - IBEAS, Universit\u00e9 de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, Avenue de l'Universit\u00e9, BP 1155, 64013 Pau Cedex, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanoun", "ForeName": "Myriam", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'Ecologie Mol\u00e9culaire - IBEAS, Universit\u00e9 de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, Avenue de l'Universit\u00e9, BP 1155, 64013 Pau Cedex, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goulas", "ForeName": "Philippe", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "D\u00e9partement Chimie de Performance et Environnement, Groupe Environnement, TotalFinaElf, GRL, BP 34, 64170 Artix, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bass\u00e8res", "ForeName": "Anne", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'Ecologie Mol\u00e9culaire - IBEAS, Universit\u00e9 de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, Avenue de l'Universit\u00e9, BP 1155, 64013 Pau Cedex, France.
