The Bacillus subtilis spore, which has often been used as a surrogate microorganism for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, was used as a target microorganism. Compared to individual unit processes with ozone or UV, the inactivation of B. subtilis spores by the combined ozone/UV process was enhanced under identical conditions. To investigate the specific roles of ozone and UV in the combined ozone/UV process, sequential ozone-UV and UV-ozone processes were tested for degrees of inactivation. Additionally, the experiment was performed in the presence and absence of tert-butyl alcohol, which acted as a hydroxyl radical scavenger to assess the role of inactivation by the hydroxyl radical in the combined ozone/UV process. Among the five candidate processes, the greatest synergistic effect was observed in the combined ozone/UV process. From the comparison of five candidate processes, the hydroxyl radical and ozone were each determined to significantly enhance the overall inactivation efficiency in the combined ozone/UV process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Wonju 220-710, Republic of Korea. chorong50@yonsei.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Yeon Jung", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Byung Soo", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Joon-Wun", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spores, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18028981", "10.1016/j.watres.2007.10.008", "S0043-1354(07)00643-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
