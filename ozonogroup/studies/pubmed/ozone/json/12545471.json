Investigation of photochemical pollution in the ambient air must focus on VOCs, but the concentration of VOCs in ambient air is in a very low level (10(-9)-10(-12), volume fraction), so there are difficulties in the determination of VOCs. In this work, based on the TO14A and TO15 methods recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency of United States, an improved method for the determination of fifty-six VOCs, mainly O3 precursors, in atmospheric environment was developed. Operating conditions of VOCs preconcentrator, gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were optimized. Air sample was first frozen by liquid nitrogen, and then H2O and CO2 were eliminated in the VOCs preconcentrator. The preconcentrated VOCs sample was injected to GC and detected by MS or hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID). The C2-C10 hydrocarbons were separated effectively in capillary columns under the high concentration of CO2. The detection limits were 0.1 microgram.m-3 and the relative standard deviations were in the range from 2.57% to 9.82%. This method has been used for the determination of VOCs in real samples. The results were satisfactory."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Z X", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Se Pu", "NlmUniqueID": "9424804", "ISSNLinking": "1000-8713"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L99N5N533T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Butanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ethane"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12545471"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
