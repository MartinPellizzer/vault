Statistically significant primary (dominant) cycles with a period of 1 yr were found for O3, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric acid (HNO3), and aerosol concentrations of sulfate (SO4(2-)), calcium (Ca2+) and chloride (Cl-). Of these, peak median concentrations occurred during the spring for O3 and Ca2+, during the warmer, drier months (April-September) for SO4(2-) and HNO3, and during the cooler, wetter months (October-March) for SO2 and Cl-. Statistically significant secondary cycles of 6 months duration were seen for concentrations of O3, SO4(2-), HNO3, Ca2+, and Cl-. Daily maximum O3 concentrations exhibited a statistically significant increase over the period of record of 0.33 +/- 0.26 ppb/yr. Statistically significant declines were found for concentrations of SO2, SO4(2-), HNO3, Ca2+, and potassium, ranging from 20 to 36% from levels at the start of the sampling period. Declines in ambient concentrations of SO2, SO4(2-), and HNO3 reflect local declines in anthropogenic emissions of the primary precursors SO2 and NOx over the past decade. Trends in Ca2+ and potassium ion concentrations are in line with a broader North American declining trend in acid-neutralizing cations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aquatic and Atmospheric Sciences Division, Environment Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. roxanne.vingarzan@ec.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vingarzan", "ForeName": "Roxanne", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomson", "ForeName": "Bruce", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Rain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acid Rain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "British Columbia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15115375", "10.1080/10473289.2004.10470917"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
