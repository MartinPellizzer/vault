A 12 h sampling basis time resolution was applied in order to study their diurnal and nocturnal variations. Observed concentrations were about 10 times higher at the traffic site for all compounds and were higher during the night-time for both sites (except for NPAHs at the traffic site). No significant differences in PAH and OPAH profiles were observed at both sites whereas, for NPAHs, 1-nitropyrene (diesel source) was the most abundant at the traffic site and 2+3-nitrofluoranthene (secondary formed by gas-phase reaction) was predominant at the suburban site. The study of the specific ratio 2-nitrofluoranthene/1-nitropyrene (2-NFlt/1-NP) showed a local formation of NPAHs in gaseous phase at the suburban site. A detailed analysis showed that atmospheric humidity and rainfalls modified differently PAH and NPAH profiles, in comparison to OPAH. A difference of the scale variability of water solubility between, light (MW\u2264228 g mol(-1)) and heavy compounds (MW\u2265273 g mol(-1)), could explain these observations. The specific study of the relationships between PACs and other measured pollutants highlighted that particle resuspension could constitute a significant source of PM on the traffic site. Even if NPAH formation seemed clearly evident at the suburban site during periods characterised by high O(3) and NO(2) concentration levels, results showed also that the primary and/or secondary origins of OPAHs and NPAHs were strongly dependent on the sampling site and on sampling conditions. Finally, we conclude that higher time sampling resolutions would be helpful in investigating the atmospheric chemistry and behaviours of PACs in correlation with the local meteorological variations and the daily cycle of human activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.
