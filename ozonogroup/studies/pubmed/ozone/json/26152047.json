Although originally identified as gene silencers capable of extending cell lifespan, the involvement of sirtuins in many different areas of cell biology has now become widespread. Our approach has been to study the temporal variation and also the effect of environmental stressors, such as ultraviolet B (UVB) and ozone, on sirtuin expression in human epidermal keratinocytes. In this report, we measured the variation in expression of several sirtuins over time and also show how a low dose of UVB can affect this pattern of expression. Moreover, we correlated these changes to variations in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ATP levels. Our data show significant variations in normal sirtuin expression, which may indicate a generalized response by sirtuins to cell cycle kinetics. These results also demonstrate that sirtuins as a family of molecules are sensitive to UVB-induced disruption and may suggest a new paradigm for determining environmental stress on aging and provide direction for the development of new cosmetic products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pelle", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Kelly", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pernodet", "ForeName": "Nadine", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cosmet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9814276", "ISSNLinking": "1525-7886"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Sirtuins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidermal Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sirtuins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26152047"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
