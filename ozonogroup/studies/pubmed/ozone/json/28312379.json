P. versicolora consumed more ozone treated foliage, but were more fecund when reared on charcoal-filtered air treated plants. Beetle development rates and survivorship were not significantly different on treated and control cottonwoods. We concluded that: 1) Ozone fumigation of cottonwood reduced foliage quality, and the reproductive success and overall performance of P. versicolora. 2) increased foliage consumption by beetles was probably a mechanism compensating for decreases in foliage quality. 3) Reductions in beetle fecundity were due to an initial reduction in oviposition rates. 4) Beetle feeding preference did not correlate with the suitability of foliage for beetle performance. These results are discussed in relation to the impact of air pollution on plant-insect interactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Greeley Memorial Laboratory, Yale University, 370 Prospect Street, 06511, New Haven, CT, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coleman", "ForeName": "James S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The New York Botanical Garden, Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum, Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Box AB, 12545, Millbrook, NY, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Clive G", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Oecologia. 1980 Sep;46(3):347-353", "ArticleIdList": ["28310043"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1986 Jul;69(4):556-560", "ArticleIdList": ["28311615"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1975 Sep;18(3):185-197", "ArticleIdList": ["28308676"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1985 Nov 1;230(4725):566-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17809689"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1988 Jun;76(1):51-56", "ArticleIdList": ["28312378"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1984 Jul;63(1):90-105", "ArticleIdList": ["28311171"]}, {"Citation": "Evolution. 1977 Sep;31(3):568-579", "ArticleIdList": ["28563490"]}, {"Citation": "Tree Physiol. 1986 Sep;1(2):177-84", "ArticleIdList": ["14975894"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1987 Jan;13(1):203-18", "ArticleIdList": ["24301371"]}, {"Citation": "Tree Physiol. 1987 Mar;3(1):93-102", "ArticleIdList": ["14975836"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28312379", "10.1007/BF00379600", "10.1007/BF00379600"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
