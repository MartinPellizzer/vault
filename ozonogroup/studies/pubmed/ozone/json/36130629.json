Key performances of PbO<sub>2</sub> electrodes, such as energy efficiency and space-time yield, are influenced by morphological as well as compositional factors. Micro-nano structure regulation and decoration of metal/non-metal on PbO<sub>2</sub> is an outstanding technique to revamp its electrocatalytic activities and enhance environmental engineering efficiency. The aim of this review is to comprehensively summarize the recent research progress in the morphology control, the structure constructions, and the element doping of PbO<sub>2</sub> materials, further with many environmental application cases evaluated. Concerning electrochemical environmental engineering, the lead dioxide employed in chemical oxygen demand detection, ozone generators, and wastewater treatment has been comprehensively reviewed. In addition, the future research perspectives, challenges and the opportunities on PbO<sub>2</sub> materials for environmental applications are proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
