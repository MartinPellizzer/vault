By taking advantage of the progress in artificial intelligence, deep learning models have been applied to satellite based O<sub>3</sub> retrieval. However, the underlying physical mechanisms that influence surface O<sub>3</sub> into model construction have rarely been considered. To overcome this issue, we considered the physical mechanisms influencing surface O<sub>3</sub> and used them to select relevant variable features for developing a novel deep learning model. We used a wide and deep model architecture to account for linear and non-linear relationships between the variables and surface O<sub>3</sub>. Using the developed model, we performed hourly inversions of surface O<sub>3</sub> retrieval over China from 2017 to 2019 (9:00-17:00, local time). The validation results based on sample-based (site-based) methods yielded an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.94 (0.86) and an RMSE of 12.79 (19.13) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, indicating the accuracy of the models. The average surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in China in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 82, 78, and 87\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. There was a diurnal pattern in surface O<sub>3</sub> in China, with levels rising significantly from 55\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> at 9:00 a.m. to 96\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> at 15:00. Between 15:00 and 16:00, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration remained stable at 95\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and decreased slightly thereafter (16:00-17:00). The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms of ozone and facilitate further studies on ozone monitoring, thereby enhancing our understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
