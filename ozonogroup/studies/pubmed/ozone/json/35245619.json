Despite its potential presence and ecotoxicity in receiving waters worldwide, information on the occurrence and fate of 6PPD-Q is limited. Here, we investigated the concentrations of 6PPD-Q and its parent chemical, 6PPD, in road dust collected from arterial and residential roads in Tokyo, Japan from May to October 2021. 6PPD-Q concentrations were highest from May to June, when atmospheric ozone concentrations are the highest in Japan; a correlation between 6PPD-Q and photochemical oxidants, as an alternative to ozone, corroborated this finding. We also found that 6PPD-Q concentrations at photochemical oxidant concentrations ranging from 35 to 47\u00a0ppbv were higher in dust collected from roads with high traffic volumes (i.e., arterial roads; median: 8.6 \u03bcg/g-<sub>OC</sub>) than in dust collected from roads with lower traffic volumes (i.e., residential roads; median: 6.3 \u03bcg/g-<sub>OC</sub>), indicating that 6PPD-Q is generated from traffic-related sources. We also found that 6PPD-Q was leached from dust particles within a few hours, with a log partitioning coefficient between organic carbon and water (K<sub>OC</sub>) of 3.2-3.5. The present results will help to understand the environmental occurrence, fate, and behavior of 6PPD-Q."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
