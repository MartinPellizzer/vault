Para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) has been used as a model pollutant since it has been reported to be an ideal compound for ozone AOP studies because it displays slow reaction rates with ozone, but rapid oxidation kinetics with the OH radical. While the ozone was quite stable when the stainless steel rings were used as a packing media, the ceramic media enhanced the decomposition of the ozone. Nevertheless, the water quality was found to significantly affect the ozone stability. Indeed, in addition to high pH, both NOM and TIC lowered the ozone concentration in the system. When considering the degradation of pCBA, the ceramic packing rings, as high pH and NOM, increases its rate constant which is correlated to the higher decomposition of ozone and consequently to higher formation of hydroxyl radicals. In contrast, TIC decreased the degradation rate of pCBA even if it decomposes the ozone which is due to its scavenging effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, NTNU-Norwegian University of Science and Technology, S.P.Andersensvei 5, N-7491, Trondheim, Norway. kamal.azrague@ntnu.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azrague", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osterhus", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Biomorgi", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12597-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Stainless Steel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IC7888DF4L", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorobenzoic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stainless Steel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19342818", "10.2166/wst.2009.078"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
