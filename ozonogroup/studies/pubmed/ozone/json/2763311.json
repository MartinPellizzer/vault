This is done for both 1 h and 8 h averaging times. Concentrations of ozone in the ambient atmosphere can violate the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and also the Time Weighted Average-Threshold Limit Value (TWA-TLV) for workers. Exposures that occurred in a 1982 episode associated with a health effects study are described in detail. The effective dose received by a camper at a children's summer camp appeared to be similar to that delivered to volunteers during a controlled human exposure study in which effects on pulmonary function were observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Community Medicine, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscatway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lioy", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dyba", "ForeName": "R V", "Initials": "RV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8602702", "ISSNLinking": "0748-2337"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2763311", "10.1177/074823378900500309"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
