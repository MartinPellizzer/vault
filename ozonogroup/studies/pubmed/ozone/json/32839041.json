The increasing trend of the air pollution, especially in developing countries, may exert its detrimental effects on human health. The potentially harmful effects of air pollution on the human health have been recognized and many epidemiological studies have clearly suggested the strong association between air pollution exposure and increased morbidities and mortalities. Air pollutants are classified into gaseous pollutants including carbon mono oxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone and sulfur dioxide, and particulate matters (PMs). All air pollutants have destructive effects on the health systems including cardiovascular system. Many studies have demonstrated the effect of air pollutant on the occurrence of ST elevation myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrythmias, and peripheral arterial disease. Recently, some studies suggested that air pollution may be associated with cardiac arrhythmias. In this study, we aimed to comprehensively review the last evidences related to the association of air pollutant and cardiac arrythmias. We found that particulate matters (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and UFP) and gaseous air pollutants can exert undesirable effects on cardiac rhythms. Short-term and long-term exposure to the air pollutants can interact with the cardiac rhythms through oxidative stress, autonomic dysfunction, coagulation dysfunction, and inflammation. It seems that particulate matters, especially PM<sub>2.5</sub> have stronger association with cardiac arrhythmias among all air pollutants. However, future studies are needed to confirm these results."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
