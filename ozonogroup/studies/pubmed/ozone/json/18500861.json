Modeling and observations assign this specific isotopic composition mainly to the photochemical steady state that exists in the atmosphere between ozone and nitrate precursors, namely, the nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2). However, this transfer is poorly quantified and is built on unverified assumptions about which oxygen atoms of ozone are transferred to NO(x), greatly weakening any interpretation of the nitrate oxygen isotopic composition in terms of chemical reaction pathways and the oxidation state of the atmosphere. With the aim to improve our understanding and quantify how nitrate inherits this unusual isotopic composition, we have carried out a triple isotope study of the reaction NO+O3. Using ozone intramolecular isotope distributions available in the literature, we have found that the central atom of the ozone is abstracted by NO with a probability of (8+/-5)%(+/-2 sigma) at room temperature. This result is at least qualitatively supported by dynamical reaction experiments, the non-Arrhenius behavior of the kinetic rate of this reaction, and the kinetic isotope fractionation factor. Finally, we have established the transfer function of the isotope anomaly of O3 to NO2, which is described by the linear relationship Delta 17 O(NO2)=A x Delta 17 O(O3)+B, with A=1.18+/-0.07(+/-1 sigma) and B=(6.6+/-1.5)[per thousand](+/-1 sigma). Such a relationship can be easily incorporated into models dealing with the propagation of the ozone isotope anomaly among oxygen-bearing species in the atmosphere and should help to better interpret the oxygen isotope anomaly of atmospheric nitrate in terms of its formation reaction pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Glaciologie et G\u00e9ophysique de l'Environnement, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier Grenoble, 38400 Grenoble, France. joel.savarino@lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savarino", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morin", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baroni", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doussin", "ForeName": "J-F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18500861", "10.1063/1.2917581"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
