Mid-coronal dentin surfaces were revealed by cutting occlusal enamel and a standard smear layer was obtained by using 600-800-1200 grid silicon carbide abrasive papers. Specimens were randomly assigned to four groups according to the disinfectant used: Group 1: Control (no disinfectant); Group 2: 2% chlorhexidine based (Consepsis); Group 3: 10 ppm ozonated water (TeknO<sub>3</sub>zone); Group 4: 5% boric acid (Handmade). Each group was divided into three subgroups according to the type of adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond, OptiBond XTR, and Tokuyama Universal). Specimens were bonded using either Clearfil SE Bond, OptiBond XTR or Tokuyama Universal, which were employed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Resin composite microcylinders were bonded using Tygon<sup>\u00ae</sup> tubes for \u03bc-SBS testing. After specimens were stored for 24 h, at 37\u00b0C in distilled water, \u03bc-SBS test was measured with a universal test machine (LF Plus, Lloyd, Instrument). \u03bc-SBS results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's tests.", "When the mean microshear bond strength values of the control group were compared, the difference between the subgroups was not significant (P < 0.05). When the mean microshear bond strength values of the chx, ozonated water, and boric acid were compared, the difference between Clearfil SE Bond and Tokuyama Universal was significant (P < 0.05) and the difference between the other groups was not significant (P > 0.05).", "Ozonated water and boric acid may be as an alternative to other materials used as cavity disinfectants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akturk", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bektas", "ForeName": "O O", "Initials": "OO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozkanoglu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Sakarya Univercity, Sakarya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G Akin", "ForeName": "E G", "Initials": "EG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101150032"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Boric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Consepsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Optibond"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resin Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R57ZHV85D4", "NameOfSubstance": "boric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Boric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Cements"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Etching"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Resin Cements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smear Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31793485", "10.4103/njcp.njcp_281_19", "NigerJClinPract_2019_22_12_1758_272206"]}}]}
