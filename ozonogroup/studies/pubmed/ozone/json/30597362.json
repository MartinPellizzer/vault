In this study, we systematically investigated the degradation of Pentabromophenol (PBP) in an aqueous medium by using two different ozone generators (sources: air and water). We studied various factors that influenced the degradation kinetics of PBP, including the pH (7.0, 8.0, and 9.0), humic acid (HA) and anions (Cl<sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). PBP was efficiently degraded within 5\u202fmin (O<sub>3</sub> source: water) and 45\u202fmin (O<sub>3</sub> source: air) at pH 8.0 maintained by phosphate buffer. Reaction kinetics revealed 17\u202fb\u202fy-products with five possible pathways, including dimers with their isomers and lower bromophenols. Furthermore, the frontier molecular orbital theory was employed to confirm the proposed ozonation pathways, including the breakage of the CO bond at C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> positions, and the cleavage of the CC bond at C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>6</sub> position. Product P5, P14 (hydroxyl-nonabromophenyl ether) and P15 (dihydroxyl-octabromophenyl ether) were identified with isomers. Ecological Structure Activity Relationships toxicity assessment resulted into the conversion of highly toxic PBP (acute toxicity: LC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.11\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> for fish, LC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.124\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> for daphnia, and EC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.118\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> for green algae) to less harmful products aside from dimers. P14 (acute toxicity: LC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.04\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>5</sup>) found to be more toxic as compare to PBP. From these findings, we concluded that ozonation is an effective and ideal process for PBP degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
