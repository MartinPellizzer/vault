It is not known, however, whether chronic exposure to low doses of ozone, such as those encountered in polluted ambient atmospheres, could also result in abnormal accumulations of lung collagen. Rats were exposed to ozone for 20 hr per day, 7 days per week for 3, 6, 12, and 18 months at concentrations of 0.12, 0.25, or 0.50 ppm. Controls were exposed under identical conditions to purified air. Upon removal from the chambers, rats were euthanized and lung tissue slices incubated with [14C]proline. The incorporation of 14C into hydroxyproline and the total hydroxyproline content of lung tissue were measured as estimates of lung collagen synthesis and content, respectively. The formation of labeled hydroxyproline tended to decrease significantly with time in controls and at the three ozone doses. There were, however, no significant dose-related changes at any of the time points tested. Total lung hydroxyproline increased with age in all groups, but no dose-related changes were detected at any time point. It was concluded that chronic exposure of rats to ozone at concentrations which approximate ambient urban concentrations did not affect normal age-related changes in either synthesis or accumulation of lung collagen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Labs, Warren, Michigan 48090."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kehrer", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smiler", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL01435", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3353990", "10.1016/0041-008x(88)90184-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
