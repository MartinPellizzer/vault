Ethylenediurea (EDU) is a synthetic chemical that has been widely applied in scientific studies as a protectant against O<sub>3</sub> phytotoxicities. Despite four decades of active research, the exact mechanisms to explain its mode of action remain unclear. Here, we aimed to reveal whether EDU's phytoprotective property is due to its control over stomatal regulation and/or its action as a nitrogen (N) fertilizer, utilizing stomatal-unresponsive plants of a hybrid poplar (Populus koreana \u00d7 trichocarpa cv. Peace) grown in a free-air O<sub>3</sub>-concenctration enrichment (FACE) facility. Plants were treated with water (WAT), EDU (400\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>), or EDU's constitutive amount of N every nine days, and exposed to ambient (AOZ) or elevated (EOZ) O<sub>3</sub> during a growing season (June-September). EOZ led to extensive foliar injuries (but protected against rust disease), lower photosynthetic rate (A), impaired dynamics of responses of A to changes in light intensity, and smaller total plant leaf area. EDU protected against common phytotoxicities caused by EOZ without inducing stomatal closure, since stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>) was generally unresponsive to the experimental treatments. EDU also modulated the dynamic response of A to light fluctuations under O<sub>3</sub> stress. N addition acted as a fertilizer but did not satisfactorily protect plants against O<sub>3</sub> phytotoxicities. The results suggest that EDU protects against O<sub>3</sub> phytotoxicity not by adding N or controlling stomata, which provides a new insight into our understanding of the mode of action of EDU as a protectant against O<sub>3</sub> phytotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
