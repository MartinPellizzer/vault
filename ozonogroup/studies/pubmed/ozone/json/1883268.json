Airway responsiveness (AR) to methacholine was measured by modified Astograph (7 Hz oscillation method) before and after ozone exposure, and the numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and total cell counts, differential cell counts and TXB2 in BALF were measured before and after ozone exposure. Ozone exposure was carried out for 2 hr at an ozone level of 3.46 +/- 0.10 ppm (mean +/- SE). There was a significant increase in AR to methacholine after ozone exposure (p less than 0.01), and the numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and the total cell and neutrophil counts in BALF increased significantly (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with AH 21-132 at an oral dose of 20 mg/kg significantly prevented the ozone-induced AHR to methacholine (p less than 0.01), and also inhibited the increase of neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood, and the total cell counts and the neutrophil counts in BALF after ozone exposure. There was no significant change in the levels of TXB2 in BALF before and after ozone exposure. In dogs not exposed to ozone, AR to methacholine and respiratory resistance to methacholine significantly decreased after administration of AH 21-132 at an oral dose of 20 mg/kg (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Showa University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suganuma", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Idaira", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konno", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoshino", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okazawa", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adachi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuji", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Arerugi", "NlmUniqueID": "0241212", "ISSNLinking": "0021-4884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54397-85-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane B2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76166-55-7", "NameOfSubstance": "AH 21-132"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthyridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane B2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1883268"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
