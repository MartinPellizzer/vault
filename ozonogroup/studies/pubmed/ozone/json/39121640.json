To investigate the effects of preconception mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) on the association between prenatal air pollutants exposure and PTB risk, a total of 1871 expectant mothers from six regions in Henan Province were recruited. Information regarding air pollutants was obtained from 151 environmental monitoring sites, and relative mtDNAcn was evaluated using real-time PCR analysis. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, it was determined that the risk of PTB increased with elevated levels of inhalable particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but decreased with higher nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) exposure (0.05\u00a0<\u00a0P\u00a0<\u00a00.10) during the entire pregnancy. Additionally, the preconception relative mtDNAcn was lower in the PTB group (0.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23) compared to the term group (0.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29). Furthermore, for each 0.1-unit increase in preconception mtDNAcn, the risk of PTB decreased by 14.8%. Stratified analyses revealed that the risk of PTB rose with increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, regardless of the relative mtDNAcn. Moreover, the study found a significant association between PTB risk and prenatal exposure to elevated PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO, particularly in mothers with low mtDNAcn (\u22640.88) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Conversely, a decrease in the PTB risk was observed with elevated NO<sub>2</sub> exposure in mothers with high mtDNAcn (>0.88). Interaction analysis revealed that exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO interacted with mtDNAcn, respectively, affecting PTB risk (P<sub>-interaction</sub><0.05). These findings indicate a noteworthy association between PTB risk and prenatal air pollutants exposure, which is influenced by the preconception mtDNAcn."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
