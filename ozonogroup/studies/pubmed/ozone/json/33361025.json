Between January 2017 and January 2019, a total of 120 patients with lumbar disc protrusion were recruited in this study and divided into the control group and observation group, with 60 patients in each group. Patients in the control group received the ozone treatment, while those in the observation group additionally took the targeted injection of betamethasone surrounding the protruded lumbar disc. Following one month of treatment, we compared the short-term efficacy, joint range of motion in bending forward or backward of the lumbar disc, limb function, life quality and functional disturbance before and after treatment. In the observation group, the short-term effectiveness rate was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05), while after treatment, the joint range of motion in bending forward or backward of lumbar disc in the observation group was improved when comparing to the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, BI and Fugl-Meyer scale were all higher in the observation than those in the control group (P<0.05), with a lower Oswestry score (P<0.05). Targeted injection of betamethasone surrounding the protruded lumbar disc in combination with the ozone performs well in short-term efficacy, conducive to the improvement of the lumbar disc function and limb function and alleviation in function disturbance. Thus, this strategy is worthy of being promoted in clinical practice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery, Yulin Orthopaedic Hospital of Chinese and Western Medicine, Yulin, Guangxi, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Spine surgery, Ningxia people's Hospital, Yinchuan City, Ningxia, PR, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xue-Gang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery, Yulin Orthopaedic Hospital of Chinese and Western Medicine, Yulin, Guangxi, PR China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pin-Quan", "Initials": "PQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery, Yulin Orthopaedic Hospital of Chinese and Western Medicine, Yulin, Guangxi, PR China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guan-Bao", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery, Yulin Orthopaedic Hospital of Chinese and Western Medicine, Yulin, Guangxi, PR China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9842X06Q6M", "NameOfSubstance": "Betamethasone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HL6A2XXU5D", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium peroxymonosulfuric acid"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Intervertebral disc disease"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Betamethasone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disability Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Spinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Degeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recovery of Function"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "40"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33361025"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
