Experiments were carried out in a gas-liquid-solid reactor were ozone transfer and NB oxidation took place at the same time. Three configurations of the reactor were compared: empty, filled with inert glass beads and filled with faujasite pellets. First, ozone transfer coefficient (k(L)a) and decomposition rate constant (k(C)) were determined for each configuration. In presence of solid, k(L)a was 2.0 to 2.6 times higher and k(C) was 5.0 to 6.4 times higher compared to the empty reactor. Then, the various configurations were evaluated in terms of NB removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) decrease. The faujasite reactor showed higher removal of NB and decrease of COD compared to other configurations under the same conditions suggesting that the faujasite increases the oxidation rate of NB. Oxidation of NB in presence of faujasite also proved to be limited by the transfer of ozone from the gas to the liquid phase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, LISBP, Toulouse Cedex 4, France. j.reungoat@awmc.uq.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reungoat", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pic", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Man\u00e9ro", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Debellefontaine", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "faujasite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20818048", "10.2166/wst.2010.355"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
