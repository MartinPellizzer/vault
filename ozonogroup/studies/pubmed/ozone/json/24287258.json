Artificial lesions were created and subjected to the pH cycling regime for a 14 days period. Assessments were carried out before and after the pH cycling on the slabs using the microhardness testing and Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence (QLF).", "Statistical significant difference were found in the percentage change of enamel microhardness before and after pH cycling between ozone/Reductant/Patient Kit group and all the other three groups of the study, as well as between Reductant/Patient Kit group and control. There was a statistical significant difference in the change of size and severity of the lesion (\u0394Q) between all the three regimes tested and the control with a trend favouring ozone/Reductant/Patient Kit group.", "In our model, it appeared that ozone treatment alone is not effective in protecting the enamel against demineralisation or promoting remineralisation, unless combined with the Reductant/Patient Kit, which contain high levels of fluoride."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
