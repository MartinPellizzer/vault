To identify susceptible windows for associations of exposure to ambient respirable particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) with sperm concentration, sperm count, total motility, and progressive motility, we recruited 1061 men attending an infertility clinic in Wuhan, China, between 2011 and 2013. We used a distributed lag multivariate linear regression to assess the exposure-lag-response relationship between semen quality and weekly air pollution exposure. The critical exposure windows were during the 6th to 12th sperm development weeks for PM<sub>10</sub>, 10th to 11th weeks for O<sub>3</sub>, and 0 to 5th weeks for SO<sub>2</sub>. Over the entire 12 weeks of spermatogenesis period, an interquartile range increase (IQR) increase in PM<sub>10</sub> was associated with declined sperm concentration [-45.64% (95% CI: -59.97%, -26.18%) percent decrease], declined sperm count [-49.42% (95% CI: -64.42%, -28.09%) percent decrease], reduced total motility [-12.42 (95% CI: -20.47, -4.37)], and reduced progressive motility [-8.81 (95% CI: -16.00, -1.61)], SO<sub>2</sub> per IQR increase was associated with reduced sperm concentration [-39.73% (95% CI: -55.96%, -17.51%) percent decrease] and total motility [-8.64 (95% CI: -16.90, -0.38)], but NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were not associated with any of the four sperm quality parameters. Our findings suggest that exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> during spermatidogenesis period, exposure to SO<sub>2</sub> during spermatocytogenesis period, and exposure to O<sub>3</sub> during spermiogenesis period were associated with impaired semen quality, which implies air pollutants impair semen quality through varied pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
