The regression model adjusted for temporal trends, weather, and day of the week. Risks were estimated for interquartile range increases in the a priori exposure time window of the average of 0-day and 1-day lagged pollutants.", "Age was a significant effect modifier for hospitalizations, and children age 6 to 18 years consistently had the highest risk. Among children age 6 to 18 years, there was a 26% (95% CI, 10% to 44%) increased rate of ICU admissions and a 19% increased rate of general hospitalizations (95% CI, 12% to 27%) for each 12-microg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5). For each 22-ppb increase in ozone, there was a 19% (95% CI, 1% to 40%) increased risk for ICU admissions and a 20% (95% CI, 11% to 29%) increased risk for general hospitalizations.", "Warm weather patterns of ozone and PM(2.5) disproportionately affect children with asthma and appear responsible for severe attacks that could have been avoided."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.
