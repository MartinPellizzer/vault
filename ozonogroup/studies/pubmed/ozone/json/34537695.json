Extra energy and/or resources are necessary to achieve the elimination of MPs. Using the Life Cycle Assessment framework, this study assesses net environmental efficiencies for two AWTs (i) ozone systems (air-fed and pure oxygen-fed) and (ii) granular activated carbon filter. Sixty-five MPs with proven removal efficiency values and toxicity and/or ecotoxicity potentials were included in this study building on results from recent research. Consolidated Life Cycle Inventories with data quality and uncertainty characterization were produced with an emphasis on operational inputs. Results show that the direct water quality benefits obtained from AWT are outweighed by greater increases in indirect impacts from energy and resource demands. Future research should include water quality aspects not currently captured in life cycle impact assessment, such as endocrine disruption and whole-effluent toxicity, in order to assess the complete policy implications of MP removal strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
