This study conducted the multi-angle comparison of the UV/chlorine, UV/monochloramine (UV/NH<sub>2</sub>Cl), and UV/chlorine dioxide (UV/ClO<sub>2</sub>) AOPs with respect to reactive species generation, micropollutant degradation, byproduct formation, and toxicity change. The concentrations of radicals (HO<sup>\u00b7</sup>, Cl<sup>\u00b7</sup>, and ClO<sup>\u00b7</sup>) generated in the three AOPs followed the order of UV/chlorine > UV/NH<sub>2</sub>Cl > UV/ClO<sub>2</sub> at an oxidant dose of 70 \u03bcM, an irradiation wavelength of 254 nm, and a pH of 7.5. The concentration of ozone generated in the UV/ClO<sub>2</sub> AOP was higher than that in the UV/chlorine AOP, while ozone was not generated in the UV/NH<sub>2</sub>Cl AOP. The effects of pH (pH 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0) and UV wavelength (254 nm, 285 nm, and 300 nm) on the three AOPs were evaluated and compared. Using the radical and ozone concentrations determined in this study, the pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants of 24 micropollutants by the three AOPs were predicted and compared. When the three AOPs were used to treat the water containing the same concentration of natural organic matter, the formation of total organic chlorine (TOCl) and the organic byproduct-associated toxicity followed the same order of UV/chlorine > UV/NH<sub>2</sub>Cl > UV/ClO<sub>2</sub>. On the contrary, the inorganic byproduct-associated toxicity followed the order of UV/ClO<sub>2</sub> > UV/chlorine > UV/NH<sub>2</sub>Cl, due to the high concentrations of chlorite and chlorate formed in the UV/ClO<sub>2</sub> AOP. Findings in this study offer fundamental information useful for the selection and operation of AOPs for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
