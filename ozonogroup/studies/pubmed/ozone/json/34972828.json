Bacterial inactivation was determined using plate count methods and real time PCR for ARG damage (Sul1, bla<sub>tem</sub>, bla<sub>ctx</sub>, bla<sub>vim</sub> and qnrS). The reduction rate of bacterial cells and ARGs was increased by different amounts of transferred ozone dose from 11 to 45\u00a0mg/L.
