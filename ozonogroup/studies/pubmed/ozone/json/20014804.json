Light-to-power conversion efficiency (Eff) increases from 2.4% for control devices in which the ITO surface is treated only with UVO to 3.8% with the HCl + UVO treatment--effectively matching the performance of an identical device having a PEDOT:PSS anode interfacial layer. The enhancement originates from increases in V(OC) from 463 to 554 mV and FF from 49% to 66%. The modified-ITO device also exhibits a 4x enhancement in thermal stability versus an identical device containing a PEDOT:PSS anode interfacial layer. To understand the origins of these effects, the ITO surface is analyzed as a function of treatment by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy work function measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic composition analysis, and atomic force microscopic topography and conductivity imaging. Additionally, a diode-based device model is employed to further understand the effects of ITO surface treatment on device performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, the Materials Research Center, and the Argonne Northwestern Solar Energy Research Institute, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, Illinois 60208-3113, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Irwin", "ForeName": "Michael D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leever", "ForeName": "Benjamin J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Servaites", "ForeName": "Jonathan D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hersam", "ForeName": "Mark C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Durstock", "ForeName": "Michael F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marks", "ForeName": "Tobin J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20014804", "10.1021/la902879h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
