Rates of assimilation were consistently higher for both needle year age classes for ozone fumigated trees in comparison to control trees, although only statistically significant for part of the day for current year's needles. A 26% and 48% stimulation, overall, in mean daily rates of assimilation for current and previous years' needles of ozone fumigated trees was observed. This was due to an enhanced apparent quantum yield and light saturated rate of assimilation of ozone fumigated trees. The temperature response regression of assimilation versus temperature was also greater, such that at any given temperature, assimilation was higher for ozone treated trees than control trees. Stomatal conductance was greater for ozone fumigated trees than the controls, but this was only marginally statistically significant. Moreover, there was a consistent increase in chlorophyll content in both year classes in ozone-treated trees. These results are discussed in relation to a possible long term effect of ozone fumigation upon the processes of conifer winter hardening and spring de-hardening."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Edinburgh Research Station, Bush Estate, Penicuik, Midlothian EH26 0QB, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eamus", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortensen", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ro-Poulsen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davison", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092316", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90141-x", "026974919090141X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
