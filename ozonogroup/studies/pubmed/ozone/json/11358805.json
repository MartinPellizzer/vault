Tumor development in the skin could be a multistep process in which various genetic alterations, such as point mutations and deletions, occur successively. Here, we demonstrate that UVB irradiation efficiently induces deletions in the epidermis using a novel transgenic mouse, gpt delta. In this mouse model, deletions in lambda DNA integrated in the chromosome are preferentially selected as Spi(-) (sensitive to P2 interference) phages, which can then be subjected to molecular analysis. The mice were exposed to UVB at single doses of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 kJ/m(2). After 4 weeks, lambda phage was rescued from the genomic DNA of the epidermis by in vitro packaging reactions. The mutant frequencies of Spi(-) with large deletions in the epidermis increased >15-fold at a UVB dose of 0.5 kJ/m(2) over the control. Molecular sizes of most of the large deletions were >1000 bp. More than one-half of the large deletions occurred between short direct-repeat sequences from 1 to 6 bp, and the remainder had flush ends. In the unirradiated mouse, almost all of the Spi(-) mutants were 1-bp frameshifts in runs of identical bases. These results suggest that UVB irradiation induces deletions in the murine epidermis, and most of the deletions are generated through end-joining of double strand breaks in DNA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horiguchi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masumura", "ForeName": "K I", "Initials": "KI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikehata", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanke", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nohmi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "2984705R", "ISSNLinking": "0008-5472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Escherichia coli Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentosyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.2.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Gpt protein, E coli"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriophage lambda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Frameshift Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Transgenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pentosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Deletion"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11358805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
