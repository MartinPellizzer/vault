In addition, cleaning agents, personal care products, coatings, and other volatile chemical products (VCPs), evaporate and react in the atmosphere producing secondary pollutants. Here, we show high air emissions from VCP usage (\u2265 14 kg person<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, at least 1.7\u00d7 higher than current operational estimates) are supported by multiple estimation methods and constraints imposed by ambient levels of ozone, hydroxyl radical (OH) reactivity, and the organic component of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in Pasadena, California. A near-field model, which estimates human chemical exposure during or in the vicinity of product use, indicates these high air emissions are consistent with organic product usage up to ~75 kg person<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and inhalation of consumer products could be a non-negligible exposure pathway. After constraining the PM<sub>2.5</sub> yield to 5% by mass, VCPs produce ~41% of the photochemical organic PM<sub>2.5</sub> (1.1 \u00b1 0.3 <i>\u03bc</i>g m<sup>-3</sup>) and ~17% of maximum daily 8-hr average ozone (9 \u00b1 2 ppb) in summer Los Angeles. Therefore, both toxicity and ambient criteria pollutant formation should be considered when organic substituents are developed for VCPs in pursuit of safer and sustainable products and cleaner air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Research Participant at the Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Momei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "Benjamin N", "Initials": "BN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Isaacs", "ForeName": "Kristin K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Laboratory, NOAA Earth System Research Laboratories, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "LastName": "McDonald", "ForeName": "Brian C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Quanyang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Laboratory, NOAA Earth System Research Laboratories, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "LastName": "McKeen", "ForeName": "Stuart A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Research Participant at the Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Koval", "ForeName": "Lauren", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "Allen L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Dynamics Information Technology Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Efstathiou", "ForeName": "Christos", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Dynamics Information Technology Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Chris", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Pye", "ForeName": "Havala O T", "Initials": "HOT"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Sustain", "NlmUniqueID": "101732409", "ISSNLinking": "2398-9629"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "McDonald BC et al.
