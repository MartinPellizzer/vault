While our knowledge concerning the pulmonary effects of single exposures to ozone has increased rapidly over recent years, the effects of repeated exposures are less understood. The goal of the present study was to determine whether airway responsiveness is increased after near-lifetime exposure to ozone. Airway segments representing approximately eighth generation airways were isolated from Fischer 344 rats of both genders that had been exposed for 6 hr per day, 5 days per week for 20 months to 0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 parts per million (ppm) ozone. Circumferential tension development was measured in isolated airways in response to bethanechol, acetylcholine, and electrical field stimulation. Responsiveness of the airways to the contractile stimuli was described by the effective dose or frequency that elicited half-maximum contraction (ED50) and the maximum response. Since ozone exposure is associated with remodeling of peripheral airways, smooth muscle area was determined and tension responses were normalized to the area measurements. Before normalization of tension data to smooth muscle area, neither the ED50 nor maximum response of small bronchi to the contractile stimuli was altered after chronic ozone exposure. Smooth muscle area was greater in airways isolated from animals that had been exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone. After accounting for smooth muscle area, maximum responses of the small bronchi isolated from male rats were significantly reduced after 0.12 and 0.5 ppm ozone. Although not significant statistically, a similar trend was observed in airways isolated from female rats. These results suggest that the increase in airway responsiveness associated with acute ozone exposure does not persist during near-lifetime exposure. Although the mechanism responsible for the adaptation to the effects of O3 on airway responsiveness is unknown, the results indicate that smooth muscle cell function was compromised by the chronic exposure. The mechanism(s) responsible for mediating this effect and the relevance of these results to humans remains to be determined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, West Virginia 25704-9388, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szarek", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stewart", "ForeName": "N L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J Z", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Webb", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valentovic", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Catalano", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8200838", "ISSNLinking": "0272-0590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinergic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinergic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tensile Strength"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8835229", "10.1006/faat.1995.1160", "S0272059085711608"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
