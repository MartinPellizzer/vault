There were five control and three exposed monkeys for each of the post-exposure times for a total of 20 monkeys. Neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood and labeled with 111In-tropolonate were infused in the cephalic vein in unanesthetized monkeys (except the 1-h group) 4 to 5 h before necropsy. The trachea and microdissected bronchi (fourth and ninth generations) and respiratory bronchioles (fifteenth generation) from the right upper lobe of each monkey were examined by electron microscopy. Labeled neutrophil influx into lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was maximal at 12 h and returned to baseline by 24 h after exposure. This was in contrast to total neutrophils (labeled and unlabeled) in BALF, which were significantly elevated through 24 h after exposure but returned to baseline by 72 h. Lavage protein was significantly elevated at 24 h after exposure but was at control levels at all other times. Morphometric observations showed epithelial necrosis at 1 and 12 h in the trachea and bronchioles but continued to be observed in significant numbers at 24 h after exposure in bronchi. A significant increase in the labeling index of epithelial cells was observed at 12 h only in bronchi. Epithelial necrosis and repair was associated with the presence of granulocytes in the epithelium and interstitium of all airway levels. However, eosinophils were maximally increased in the epithelium and interstitium of bronchi at 24 h after exposure when epithelial necrosis was maximal in these airways and when lavage protein was significantly elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "California Primate Research Center, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyde", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hubbard", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinkerton", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8917225", "ISSNLinking": "1044-1549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mucins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Basement Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca mulatta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mucins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1581072", "10.1165/ajrcmb/6.5.481"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
