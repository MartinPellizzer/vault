The effect of the experiment on the observed products and rates of reaction is compared in order to derive a better understanding of some of the variations in oleic acid reaction rates reported by a range of researchers. One set of measurements is made using thin films of oleic acid in an attenuated total internal reflection configuration, and it is shown that a treatment in which the ATR evanescent wave is convolved with a moving reaction front is essential for the extraction of reliable kinetic data. The results are compared to similar measurements in a recently developed aerosol flow tube equipped with a cross-beam infrared spectroscopic probe. Rates of reaction in the aerosol phase are observed to be approximately 10 times faster and possible reasons for this discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK M13 9PL."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Last", "ForeName": "Deborah J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "N\u00e1jera", "ForeName": "Juan J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horn", "ForeName": "Andrew B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19756277", "10.1039/b901815h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
