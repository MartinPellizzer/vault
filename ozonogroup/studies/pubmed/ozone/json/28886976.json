Ozonation processes were applied and optimized for the further removal of those refractory matters in this work. Micro-bubble ozonation (MB-O<sub>3</sub>) possessed the best performance, and 76.0% and 69.9% of COD and TOC were found to be removed under the optimum conditions with ozone dosage of 2.4g/L, initial pH of 9 and reaction time of 120min. The reaction rate k in MB-O<sub>3</sub> was 0.0104min<sup>-1</sup>, three times higher than that in normal O<sub>3</sub>. The percentages of humic acid and fulvic acid in CL decreased from 24.1% to 14.3% and 49.6% to 25.0%, while that of HyI substances increased from 26.3% to 60.7%, which was also found in the fraction of <2000Da, with the occupied percentage increased from 0 to 63.0%. The humic acid-like substances might be transformed to matters with carbonyl and carboxyl group, since a continuous blue-shift was observed from Em/Ex 475/390 to 410/325nm. MB-O<sub>3</sub> could be a promising method for the advanced treatment of CL."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
