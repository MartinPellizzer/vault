Following the assessment of gingival index, periodontal pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss, all patients underwent full-mouth scaling and root planing. Upper right and left quadrants of each patient were considered as sample sites in the study. Among these split-mouth sites, upper right quadrant of each patient was subjected to ozonated water irrigation with a 22-gauge needle and left upper quadrant was treated with PDT, which involved sulcus irrigation with indocyanine green dye (0.05 mg/ml) followed by low-level diode laser light application at 0.5 W and 810 nm (AMD Picasso) through a fiber-optic tip of 10 mm length, default angle of 60\u00b0, and fiber core diameter of 400 \u03bcm in noncontact continuous wave mode. Patients were recalled at the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> months regularly, and the therapy was repeated at the same sites in the same manner. Clinical parameters recorded before the study were assessed again at the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>- and 6<sup>th</sup>-month period.", "A statistically significant reduction (<i>P</i> < 0.05) was observed in gingival index scores within both the study groups at all intervals of the study. In Ozone therapy (OT) group, a statistically significant difference was noted for total periodontal pocket depth values between baseline and 2<sup>nd</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.000), baseline and 6<sup>th</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.000), and between 2<sup>nd</sup> month and 6<sup>th</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.029). In the PDT group, on contrary, a statistically significant difference was noticed in total periodontal pocket probing depth values between baseline and 2<sup>nd</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.000) and baseline to 6<sup>th</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.000), but a similar significant difference was not noticed between 2<sup>nd</sup>-month and 6<sup>th</sup>-month periods (<i>P</i> = 0.269). In group OT, a statistically significant difference was noted for total clinical attachment loss between baseline and 2<sup>nd</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.000), baseline and 6 months (<i>P</i> = 0.000), and 2<sup>nd</sup> month and 6<sup>th</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.019). In group PDT, a statistically significant difference in terms of its improvement was noted at intervals between baseline and 2 months (<i>P</i> = 0.000) and from baseline to 6 months (<i>P</i> = 0.000) but not between 2<sup>nd</sup> month and 6<sup>th</sup> month (<i>P</i> = 0.129).", "Results of the study showed that sub-gingival OT and PDT equally improved the clinical outcomes of treatment drastically following mechanical debridement at the end of first 2 months. Thereafter, it was shown to improve steadily throughout the study period, with slightly better results with OT compared with PDT."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Indian Society of Periodontology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Periodontology and Oral Implantology, Royal Dental College, Palakkad, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Ameyaroy", "ForeName": "Divyasree Kochilat", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Periodontology and Oral Implantology, Royal Dental College, Palakkad, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Ramabhadran", "ForeName": "Biniraj Kannanganatt", "Initials": "BK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Periodontology and Oral Implantology, Royal Dental College, Palakkad, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Emmatty", "ForeName": "Rishi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Periodontology and Oral Implantology, Royal Dental College, Palakkad, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "Tony Pallipurathukaran", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Periodontology and Oral Implantology, Royal Dental College, Palakkad, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Jose", "ForeName": "Priya", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Indian Soc Periodontol", "NlmUniqueID": "101499342", "ISSNLinking": "0972-124X"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Gupta M, Abhishek GM.
