The results were compared with those obtained in the absence of the catalyst and in the presence of the parent carbon materials, as well as in the presence of ceria (CeO2). Carbon materials containing ceria showed an interesting catalytic effect. Both materials enhanced the mineralization of BZF relatively to single ozonation and ozonation catalysed by the corresponding carbon materials. In the catalytic ozonation with these materials, both surface and bulk reactions are supposed to occur. The BZF ozonation catalysed by CeO2 leaded to the highest mineralization degrees, indicating that the reaction mechanism followed in the presence of CeO2 (free radical oxidation in solution) leads to the formation of intermediates more easily degradable, mainly after 120\u2005min of reaction. Some primary products and refractory final oxidation compounds in single and catalytic ozonation of BZF were followed. The original chlorine present on the BZF molecule is completely converted to chloride anion and part of the nitrogen is mainly converted to NO3- along with smaller amounts of NO2- and NH4+. Microtox tests revealed that simultaneous use of ozone and CeO2 originated lower acute toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica, Faculdade de Engenharia , Laborat\u00f3rio de Cat\u00e1lise e Materiais (LCM), Laborat\u00f3rio Associado LSRE/LCM, Universidade do Porto , Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, Porto 4200-465 , Portugal."}], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "Alexandra G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "\u00d3rf\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 J M", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "Manuel Fernando R", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30K4522N6T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "619G5K328Y", "NameOfSubstance": "ceric oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9449Q51XH", "NameOfSubstance": "Bezafibrate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aliivibrio fischeri"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bezafibrate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cerium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25189707", "10.1080/09593330.2014.961563"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
