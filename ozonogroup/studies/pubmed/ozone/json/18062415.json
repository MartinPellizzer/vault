All the experiments were performed on the laboratory scale set-up. The results showed that colour removal efficiencies by UV or bleach (H2O2) alone were not so efficient. Fenton process with bleach wastewater was found to be the most effective at process conditions such as pH of 3 and H2O2/Fe2+ ratio of 24:1, resulting in 64% colour removal. Almost complete colour removal, i.e., 99% and 95% were achieved by UV/H2O2 and UV/bleach wastewater in 30 and 60 min, respectively. Ozonation proved an efficient method for decolorization of Blue CL-BR dye at alkaline pH. It was possible to achieve 98% colour removal with 30 min of ozonation at pH 9. The colour removal of dye was found to follow first order kinetics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Directorate of Research and Development, University of the Punjab, Lahore-Pakistan, 41-Kamran Block, Allama Iqbal Town, Lahore-Pakistan. yasar.abdullah@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yasar", "ForeName": "Abdullah", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Nasir", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Aamir Amanat Ali", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousaf", "ForeName": "Anwer", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18062415", "10.1016/s1001-0742(07)60193-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
