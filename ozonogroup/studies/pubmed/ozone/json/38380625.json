Among several pathogens responsible for the illnesses, <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> is one of the lethal bacteria that endangers public health. Several preexisting and novel technologies, especially non-thermal technologies are being studied for their antimicrobial effects, particularly toward <i>L. monocytogenes</i>. Some noteworthy emerging technologies include ultraviolet (UV) or light-emitting diode (LED), pulsed light, cold plasma, and ozonation. These technologies are gaining popularity since no heat is employed and undesirable deterioration of food quality, especially texture, and taste is devoided. This review aims to summarize the most recent advances in non-thermal processing technologies and their effect on inactivating <i>L. monocytogenes</i> in food products and on sanitizing packaging materials. These technologies use varying mechanisms, such as photoinactivation, photosensitization, disruption of bacterial membrane and cytoplasm, etc. This review can help food processing industries select the appropriate processing techniques for optimal benefits, in which the structural integrity of food can be preserved while simultaneously destroying <i>L. monocytogenes</i> present in foods. To eliminate <i>Listeria</i> spp., different technologies possess varying mechanisms such as rupturing the cell wall, formation of pyrimidine dimers in the DNA through photochemical effect, excitation of endogenous porphyrins by photosensitizers, generating reactive species, causing leakage of cellular contents and oxidizing proteins and lipids. These technologies provide an alternative to heat-based sterilization technologies and further development is still required to minimize the drawbacks associated with some technologies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA."}], "LastName": "Kaavya", "ForeName": "Rathnakumar", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center of Excellence in Seafood Science and Innovation, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Rajasekaran", "ForeName": "Bharathipriya", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sargento Foods, Elkhart Lake, WI, USA."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Kartik", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering and Technology, Tezpur University, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Nickhil", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center of Excellence in Seafood Science and Innovation, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Palanisamy", "ForeName": "Suguna", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center of Excellence in Seafood Science and Innovation, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Palamae", "ForeName": "Suriya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, Old Goa, Goa, India."}], "LastName": "Chandra Khanashyam", "ForeName": "Anandu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0996-8328"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology, Biochemistry, and Post-Harvest Technology Division, ICAR - Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Pandiselvam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center of Excellence in Seafood Science and Innovation, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Benjakul", "ForeName": "Soottawat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences and Industry/Food Science Institute, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA."}], "LastName": "Thorakattu", "ForeName": "Priyamavada", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioral Health and Nutrition, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA."}], "LastName": "Ramesh", "ForeName": "Bharathi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Food Technology and Processing, National Research and Innovation Agency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Aurum", "ForeName": "Fawzan Sigma", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sargento Foods, Elkhart Lake, WI, USA."}], "LastName": "Babu", "ForeName": "Karthik Sajith", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied and Life Sciences, Uttaranchal University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India."}], "LastName": "Rustagi", "ForeName": "Sarvesh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Centre for Research and Development, University of Biotechnology, Chandigarh University, Mohali, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Ramniwas", "ForeName": "Seema", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38380625", "10.1080/10408398.2024.2316295"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
