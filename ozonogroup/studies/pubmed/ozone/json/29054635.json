These emissions are especially of great interest in large cities of East and Southeast Asia. We conducted a case study in which VOC emissions from kitchen extraction stacks have been sampled in total 57 times in the Megacity Shanghai. To obtain representative data, we sampled VOC emissions from kitchens, including restaurants of seven common cuisine types, canteens, and family kitchens. VOC species profiles and their chemical reactivities have been determined. The results showed that 51.26%\u00b123.87% of alkane and 24.33\u00b111.69% of oxygenated VOCs (O-VOCs) dominate the VOC cooking emissions. Yet, the VOCs with the largest ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP) were from the alkene and aromatic categories, accounting for 6.8-97.0% and 73.8-98.0%, respectively. Barbequing has the most potential of harming people's heath due to its significant higher emissions of acetaldehyde, hexanal, and acrolein. Methodologies for calculating VOC emission factors (EF) for restaurants that take into account VOCs emitted per person (EF<sub>person</sub>), per kitchen stove (EF<sub>kitchen stove</sub>) and per hour (EF<sub>hour</sub>) are developed and discussed. Methodologies for deriving VOC emission inventories (S) from restaurants are further defined and discussed based on two categories: cuisine types (S<sub>type</sub>) and restaurant scales (S<sub>scale</sub>). The range of S<sub>type</sub> and S<sub>scale</sub> are 4124.33-7818.04t/year and 1355.11-2402.21t/year, respectively. We also found that S<sub>type</sub> and S<sub>scale</sub> for 100,000 people are 17.07-32.36t/year and 5.61-9.95t/year, respectively. Based on Environmental Kuznets Curve, the annual total amount of VOCs emissions from catering industry in different provinces in China was estimated, which was 5680.53t/year, 6122.43t/year, and 66,244.59t/year for Shangdong and Guangdong provinces and whole China, respectively. Large and medium-scaled restaurants should be paid more attention with respect to regulation of VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
