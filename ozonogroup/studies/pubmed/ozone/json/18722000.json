A number of potential production mechanisms have been hypothesized and ClO(4)(-) production by ozone oxidation of surface bound Cl(-) was demonstrated. However, no information concerning the impact of concentration, final reaction products distribution, impact of reaction phase, or oxidation of important oxychlorine intermediates has been reported. Using IC-MS-MS analysis and replicate oxidation experiments, we show that exposing aqueous solutions or Cl(-) coated sand or glass surfaces to O(3) (0.96%) generated ClO(4)(-) with molar yields of 0.007 and 0.01% for aqueous Cl(-) solutions and 0.025 and 0.42% for Cl(-) coated sand and glass, respectively. Aqueous solutions of Cl(-) produced less ClO(4)(-) than Cl(-) coated sand or glass as well as a higher ratio of ClO(3)(-) to ClO(4)(-). Reduction of the initial Cl(-) mass resulted in substantially higher molar yields of ClO(4)(-) and ClO(3)(-). In addition, alkaline absorbers that captured gaseous products contained substantial quantities of Cl(-), ClO(3)(-), and ClO(4)(-). Solutions of possible oxychlorine intermediates (OCl(-) and ClO(3)(-)) exposed to O(3) produced only scant amounts of ClO(4)(-) while a ClO(2)(-) solution exposed to O(3) produced substantial molar yields of ClO(4)(-) (4% molar yield). Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy energy-dispersive X-ray analysis demonstrated a significant loss of Cl(-) and an increase in oxygen on the Cl(-) coated silica sand exposed to O(3). While the experimental conditions are not reflective of natural conditions this work clearly demonstrates the relative potential of Cl(-) precursors in perchlorate production and the likely importance of dry aerosol oxidation over solution phase reactions. It also suggests that ClO(2)(-) may be a key intermediate while ClO(3)(-) and OCl(-) are unlikely to play a significant role."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409-1023, USA. nkang@kriss.re.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Namgoo", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jackson", "ForeName": "W Andrew", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dasgupta", "ForeName": "Purnendu K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Todd A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Perchlorates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VLA4NZX2P4", "NameOfSubstance": "perchlorate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Perchlorates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18722000", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.07.010", "S0048-9697(08)00725-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
