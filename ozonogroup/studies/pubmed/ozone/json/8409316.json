The daily dose of ozone (O3) ranged from 2.7 to 30 mg. Three of the four patients whose diarrhea was of unknown etiology experienced complete resolution, and one patient had marked improvement. The fifth patient, whose diarrhea was due to Cryptosporidium, experienced no change. No consistent change in the absolute number of helper (CD4) or suppressor (CD8) lymphocytes was detected, and no obvious changes were seen in the PO2 or the results of routine hematologic and blood chemistry studies. Patients had mild to moderate local discomfort during ozone administration early in the course of treatment, but no adverse systemic effects were observed. The results of this series suggest that medical ozone administered by rectal insufflation is simple, safe, and effective. Should this simple treatment be used routinely to treat chronic intractable ARC/AIDS diarrhea?"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rehabilitation Medicine Service, San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center (SFVAMC) 94121."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carpendale", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freeberg", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Griffiss", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Gastroenterol", "NlmUniqueID": "7910017", "ISSNLinking": "0192-0790"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Rectal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8409316", "10.1097/00004836-199309000-00010"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
