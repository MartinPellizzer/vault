However, the use of OOT lags for a number of reasons, including lack of standardization, the need for numerous treatments, lack of knowledge and even denial. Anecdotally, several million treatments by OOT have been performed worldwide indicating its usefulness, mainly in peripheral arterial diseases and age-related macular degeneration. The scepticism that accompanies the systemic use of ozone can only be overcome by demonstrating the validity of OOT in controlled and randomized clinical trials. Cheaper and quicker methods, such as ozonating physiological saline with successive infusion as well as ozone rectal insufflations, are becoming popular, however, such alternative procedures are erratic, unstable and liable to be toxic, with deleterious consequences, and are likely to discredit the beneficial use of ozone.", "The approval of ozone in terms of both therapeutic efficacy and safety will depend on the results achieved by authoritative clinical trials."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 The Authors.
