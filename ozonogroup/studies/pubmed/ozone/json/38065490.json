This study focused on a total of 28 OVOCs in five different chemical classes, which were encompassed at two representative sites in Hong Kong, including a roadside and an urban area. During the summertime, the total concentrations of quantified OVOCs (\u2211<sub>OVOCs</sub>) were 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 and 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> at the roadside and urban sites, respectively, whereas the \u2211<sub>OVOCs</sub> decreased by 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0% and 38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0%, respectively, during the wintertime. Among the classes of OVOCs, carbonyls and alcohols were the two predominant at both sites, with relatively higher concentration levels of acetone, methanol, butanaldehyde, and acrolein. The sources of OVOCs have significant spatial and temporal characteristics. Spatially, OVOCs were predominately attributed to primary emission and background at the roadside site, whereas they were a combination of primary emission, secondary formation, and background at the urban site. Temporally, background sources dominated the summertime OVOCs, while the contribution of primary emissions increased for the wintertime OVOCs. The O<sub>3</sub> formation potential (OFP) for the OVOCs was calculated. The OFPs were 67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016 and 119\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> at the roadside and urban sites during the summertime, whereas the winter OFPs declined 30\u00a0% at the roadside and 38\u00a0% at the urban site. The background sources of carbonyls and alcohols at the roadside and of carbonyls and acrylates in the urban area were the major contributors to the summer OFP. Controlling the OVOC sources from local non-combustion sources such as gasoline-fuel evaporation and volatile chemical-containing products could lead to a reduction of OVOCs in the background and subsequently mitigate the OFP. This is beneficial for local O<sub>3</sub> reduction in Hong Kong and surrounding regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
