Three major HCHO sources (secondary formation, vehicular exhaust, and solvent usage) were identified and they were found to contribute in average 53%, 31% and 16% respectively to the total HCHO loading at GPEMC. Alkenes was the most important group contributing to the secondary formation of HCHO, followed by aromatics and alkanes. Among them, trans-2-butene had the largest contribution to secondary HCHO formation, with the average percentage of 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%, followed by i-butene, cis-2-butene, propene, isoprene and m,p-xylene. Secondary HCHO and HCHO emitted from vehicular emissions contributed comparably to ground-based measured O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sub>x</sub> radical at GPEMC, higher than that from solvent usage (1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0ppbv and (4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> molecule/cm<sup>3</sup> for O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sub>x</sub> radical). Our results highlight the importance of secondary HCHO formation for both photochemical formation of ozone and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in this region. It is hence critical for policy makers to propose strategies for controlling VOCs from vehicular emissions in order to reduce secondary HCHO formation. Our results also have important implication for improving the understanding of the source apportionments of HCHO and their contributions to photochemical pollution in the PRD region in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
