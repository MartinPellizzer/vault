As an advanced wastewater treatment process, ozonation is known to reduce endocrine-disrupting activity. However, it remains unclear to which extend improved wastewater treatment may reduce the endocrine-disrupting activity in the receiving water body. The present study investigated possible factors for the endocrine-disrupting activity in a small receiving water body, the Wurm River (North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany), up- and downstream of a local WWTP. The cell-based reporter gene CALUX\u00ae assay was applied to identify the endocrine-disrupting activity in the water, sediment, and suspended particulate matter. The water phase and the effluent sampling were primarily driven by applying the full-scale effluent ozonation (sampling campaigns in June 2017 and March 2019). In contrast, the sediment sampling aimed to compare the particle-bound endocrine-disrupting activity during dry (June 2017) and rainy summer (June 2018) seasons. The water phase showed low to moderate estrogenic/antiandrogenic activity. Advanced effluent treatment by ozonation led to a complete reduction of the endocrine-disrupting activity according to the limit of detection of the CALUX\u00ae assays. The suspended particulate matter originated from the water phase of the second sampling campaign revealed antiandrogenic activity only. Sediments at the sampling sites along the local WWTP revealed higher estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity after extensive rain events and were not affected by the ozonated effluent. Fluctuation patterns of the endocrine-disrupting activity in sediments were in line with fluctuated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Rainwater overflow basin release was suggested as a vector for particle-bound and dissolved endocrine-disrupting activity in the receiving water body. The present study underlined the necessity for monitoring both water and sediment phases to achieve reliable profiling of the endocrine-disrupting activity. The receptor-mediated CALUX\u00ae assays were proven to be suitable for investigating the endocrine-disrupting activity distribution in different river compartments and WWTP effluents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
