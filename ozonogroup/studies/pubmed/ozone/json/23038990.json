This paper describes a laboratory study of the photochemical reduction of IO(3)(-) in the presence of humic acid. Spectroscopic analysis showed that ~20% of IO(3)(-) was converted to \"free\" iodide (I(-)) ions and this fraction remained constant as a function of time. Direct detection of an organically fixed fraction (i.e., \u223c 80%) was not possible, but a number of test reactions with surrogate organic compounds containing functional groups identified in humic acid structures indicate that efficient substitution of iodine occurs at aromatic 1,2 diol sites. These iodinated humic acids are stable with respect to photolysis at near-UV/visible wavelengths and are likely to account for a significant proportion of the soluble iodine-containing organic material occurring within aerosols. In the lower atmosphere, oxidation of I(-) to I(2) in marine aerosol occurs mostly through the uptake of O(3), with H(2)O(2) playing a very minor role. A model of iodine chemistry in the open ocean tropical boundary layer, which incorporates these experimental results, is able to account for the observed enrichment of iodine in marine aerosol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saunders", "ForeName": "Russell W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Ravi", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "MacDonald", "ForeName": "Samantha M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plane", "ForeName": "John M C", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LF3AJ089DQ", "NameOfSubstance": "catechol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iodates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23038990", "10.1021/es3030935"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
