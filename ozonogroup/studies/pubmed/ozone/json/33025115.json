The results have been investigated by binding energy, net charge transfer, electrical and thermodynamic properties, and frontier orbitals. Although the complexes of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and CHCl<sub>3</sub> on free C<sub>20</sub> nanocages showed slightly binding energy (-\u20090.029 and -\u20090.006\u00a0eV, respectively), doping of Cr, Ti, Fe, Ni transition metal atoms on C<sub>20</sub> nanocage improved the binding energy. The best binding energy was attributed to the adsorption of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> on C<sub>19</sub>Cr (-\u20090.755\u00a0eV). Based on ESP maps, doping of Cr, Ti, Fe, and Ni is the cause of strong electrophilic region creation which is very useful for adsorption process CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and CHCl<sub>3</sub> on nanocages. Also, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis showed that the best charge transfer was 0.253\u00a0eV which was related to the formation of C<sub>19</sub>Fe-CHCl<sub>3</sub> complex. In addition, the least HOMO-LUMO energy gap between free nanocages (C<sub>20</sub>, C<sub>19</sub>Cr, C<sub>19</sub>Ti, C<sub>19</sub>Fe, and C<sub>19</sub>Ni) is 4.05\u00a0eV (C<sub>19</sub>Ti). The thermodynamic investigations indicated that due to the negative enthalpy, all of the studied adsorption processes were exothermic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, Kavosh Institute of Higher Education, Mahmood Abad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khakpour", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1434-3122"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, P.O.
