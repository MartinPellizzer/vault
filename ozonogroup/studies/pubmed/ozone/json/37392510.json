Chemical disinfectants, frequently used for water disinfection, can reduce the risk of red tides on inland fish farms. This study systematically evaluated four different chemical disinfectants (ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), permanganate (MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)) for their potential use in inland fish farms to control red tides by investigating their (i) inactivation efficacy regarding C. polykrikoides, (ii) total residual oxidant and byproduct formation, and (iii) toxicity to fish. The inactivation efficacy of C. polykrikoides cells by chemical disinfectants from highest to lowest followed the order of O<sub>3</sub> > MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> > NaOCl > H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for different cell density conditions and disinfectant doses. The O<sub>3</sub> and NaOCl treatments generated bromate as an oxidation byproduct by reacting with bromide ions in seawater. The acute toxicity tests of the disinfectants for juvenile red sea bream (Pagrus major) showed that 72-h LC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.35 (estimated), 0.39, 1.32, and 102.61\u00a0mg/L for O<sub>3</sub>, MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, NaOCl, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Considering the inactivation efficacy, exposure time of residual oxidants, byproduct formation, and toxicity toward fish, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is suggested as the most practical disinfectant for controlling red tides in inland fish farms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
