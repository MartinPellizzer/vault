After preparation and sterilization, the specimens were inoculated with 10 microL Enterococcus faecalis for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. The contaminated roots were divided into 2 experimental groups, 1 negative control group, and 1 positive control group of 20 teeth each: Group 1, KTP laser group; Group 2, gaseous ozone group; Group 3, sodium hypochlorite group (NaOCl) (negative control); and Group 4, saline group (positive control). Sterile paper points used to sample bacteria from the root canals were transferred to tubes containing 5 mL of brain heart infusion broth. Then 10-microL suspension was inoculated onto blood agar plates. The colonies of bacteria were counted and data were analyzed statistically using Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests.", "There were statistically significant differences between all groups (P < .05). The saline group had the highest number of remaining microorganisms. Complete sterilization was achieved in the 2.5% NaOCl group. The KTP laser and gaseous ozone did not completely sterilize the root canals.", "Both KTP laser and gaseous ozone have a significant antibacterial effect on infected root canals, with the gaseous ozone being more effective than the KTP laser. However, 2.5% NaOCl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with KTP laser and gaseous ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cumhuriyet University, School of Dentistry, Department of Endodontics, Sivas, Turkey. akustarci@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ku\u015ftarci", "ForeName": "Alper", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00fcmer", "ForeName": "Zeynep", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Altunba\u015f", "ForeName": "Demet", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko\u015fum", "ForeName": "Serpil", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod", "NlmUniqueID": "9508562", "ISSNLinking": "1079-2104"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12690-20-9", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium titanylphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dentin Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Solid-State"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19426912", "10.1016/j.tripleo.2009.01.048", "S1079-2104(09)00075-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
