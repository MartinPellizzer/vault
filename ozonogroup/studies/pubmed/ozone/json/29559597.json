Patients in a control group were treated with naftinfine hydrochloride and ketoconazole cream once a day. Patients in an ozone group were treated with ozonated water bath and then ozonated oil topical application once a day. Patients in the 2 groups were treated for 4 weeks. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for both groups at the end of the 1st week, the 2nd week, and the 4th week. The Pearson chi-square was performed to compare scores of the clinical signs and symptoms (CSS) and the mycological result between the 2 groups. Independent samples T-test was performed to compare the curative effect between the 2 groups.\u2029 Results: After 4 weeks' treatment, 6 patients were positive in the control group determined by mycological examination while 1 patient was positive in the ozone group, with no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Changes in CSS at the end of the 1st week, 2nd week, and 4th week were obtained and showed no significant difference between the 2 groups at the 3 different time points (P>0.05).
