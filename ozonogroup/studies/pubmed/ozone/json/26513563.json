NOX gas was oxidized by ozone (O3) and neutralized by ammonia (NH3) sequentially, and finally converted to an ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) aerosol with \u223c 100-nm peak particle diameter. The unipolar soft X-ray charger was introduced for charging the by-product particles in this dry de-NOX process. For the highest particle collection efficiency, the optimal operating conditions of the soft X-ray charger and collection part were investigated by adjusting the applied voltage of each device. The results showed that \u223c 99% of NOX was removed when the O3/NOX ratio was increased to 2 (i.e., the maximum production conditions of the NH4NO3 by-product particles by the gas-to-particle conversion process). The highest removal efficiency of particle (\u223c 90%) was observed with operating conditions of positive polarity and an applied voltage of \u223c 2-3 kV in the charger chamber. The unipolar soft X-ray charger has potential for particle removal systems in industrial settings because of its compact size, ease of operation, and non-interruptive charging mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
