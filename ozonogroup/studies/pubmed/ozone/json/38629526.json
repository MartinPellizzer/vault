The characteristics of VOCs,formation potential of secondary organic aerosol (SOA),and source of VOCs were systematically analyzed. The results showed that the maximum concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 198 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> during the pollution process and was 2.64 times the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB 3095-2012). The average concentration of VOCs was 56.8\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>,127.8\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>,and 72.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in the early,middle,and late stages of the pollution process,respectively,and the concentration of VOCs increased significantly in the middle stage. The formation potential of SOA was significantly positively correlated with PM<sub>2.5</sub>,and the contribution of aromatic hydrocarbon for SOA was larger and significantly correlated with the concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In the middle pollution stage,SOA increased,and the contribution ratio of aromatic hydrocarbon increased significantly. Conversely,the contribution of alkanes and olefin decreased significantly,which showed that aromatic hydrocarbons,namely benzene series,were the dominant species of SOA generation and had a great influence on the pollution process. Benzene,toluene,<i>m</i>-/<i>p</i>-xylene,<i>o</i>-xylene,and ethylbenzene and nonane,n-undecane,and methylcyclohexane were the priority control species in this pollution process. Solvent use source and motor vehicle emission source (gasoline and diesel vehicles) were the main sources affecting the concentration of VOCs during the autumn pollution process of Langfang,among which the contribution of gasoline vehicle emissions increased significantly in the middle pollution contribution and was the key control source."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing-Qiao", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Wen-Wen", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Development Zones Environmental Protection Agency, Langfang 065001, China."}], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "De-Yin", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-Lan", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Liang", "Initials": "HL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38629526", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202304085"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
