The first study found that wheezing infants with atopic sensitization at the time of the first wheezing episode was strongly associated with bronchial reactivity in childhood. The next review, of an article published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, investigated the complexity of atopic sensitization to foods in children with atopic dermatitis (AD). The final study confirms the determination of the US Environmental Protection Agency to the likely causal link between exposures to particulate matter and ozone and respiratory illness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
