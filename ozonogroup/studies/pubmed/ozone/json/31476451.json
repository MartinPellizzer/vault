It remains unknown whether its adverse effects can be ameliorated by dietary fish-oil supplementation.", "To assess the effects of fish-oil supplementation against oxidative stress induced by acute O<sub>x</sub> exposure.", "We conducted a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled study among 65 young adults in Shanghai, China between September 2017 and January 2018. We randomly assigned participants to receive either 2.5\u202fg/day of fish oil or placebo, and conducted four repeated physical examinations during the last two months of treatments. O<sub>x</sub> concentrations were calculated as the sum of hourly measurements of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. We measured six biomarkers on systemic oxidative stress and antioxidant activity. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the short-term effects of O<sub>x</sub> on biomarkers in each group.", "During our study period, the 72-h average O<sub>x</sub> concentration was 93.6\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Short-term exposure to O<sub>x</sub> led to weaker changes in all biomarkers in the fish oil group than in the placebo group. Compared with the placebo group, for a 10-\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O<sub>x</sub>, there were smaller decrements in myeloperoxidase (MPO, difference\u202f=\u202f5.92%, lag\u202f=\u202f0-2\u202fd, p\u202f=\u202f0.03) and malondialdehyde (MDA, difference\u202f=\u202f5.00%, lag\u202f=\u202f1\u202fd, p\u202f=\u202f0.04) in the fish-oil group; there were also larger increments in total antioxidant capacity (TAC, difference\u202f=\u202f16.33%, lag\u202f=\u202f2\u202fd, p\u202f=\u202f0.02) and in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, difference\u202f=\u202f8.89%, lag\u202f=\u202f0-2\u202fd, p\u202f=\u202f0.03) in the fish-oil group. The estimated differences for MPO were robust to adjustment for all co-pollutants and the differences for other biomarkers remained for some co-pollutants.", "This trial provides first-hand evidence that dietary fish-oil supplementation may alleviate the systemic oxidative stress induced by O<sub>x</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
