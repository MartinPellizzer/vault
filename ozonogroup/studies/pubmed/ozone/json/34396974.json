To overcome the shortcomings of metal oxide catalysts with respect to their durability and water resistance, Fe-Co double-atom catalyst (DAC) is proposed as a novel catalyst for ozone decomposition. Here, through a systematic study using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, the adsorption and catalytic decomposition of O<sub>3</sub> on Fe-Co DAC have been examined based on adsorption configuration, orbital hybridization, and electron transfer. Based on Eley-Rideal (E-R) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) reaction mechanisms, the mechanisms of ozone decomposition on Fe-Co DAC were explored by analyzing reaction paths and energy variations. To confirm the water-resistant of Fe-Co DAC, competitive adsorption behavior between O<sub>3</sub> and dominant environmental gases was discussed through ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulation. The dominant reaction mechanism of ozone decomposition is L-H and the rate-determining step is the desorption of the first oxygen molecule from the surface of Fe-Co DAC which has an energy barrier of 0.78\u00a0eV. Due to this relatively low energy barrier and high turnover frequency (TOF), the optimal operation window of catalytic O<sub>3</sub> decomposition on Fe-Co DAC is <500\u00a0K suggesting that catalytic decomposition of O<sub>3</sub> on Fe-Co DAC can occur at room temperature. This theoretical study provides new insights for designing novel catalysts for ozone decomposition and fundamental guidance for subsequent experimental research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
