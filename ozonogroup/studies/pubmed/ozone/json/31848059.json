In this study we used data of 13 sites in different regions of Switzerland with multiple years of O<sub>3</sub> measurements to quantify the stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake and the related yield loss of wheat and potato. Flux patterns for different years were calculated with the DO<sub>3</sub>SE model to disentangle the influence of contrasting seasonal environmental conditions. Regional and inter-annual differences in meteorological conditions led to considerable variations in soil water conditions and the POD<sub>6</sub> values for wheat. Potato stomatal uptake was much less influenced by soil water and showed a more even distribution of POD<sub>6</sub> values across sites and years. The estimated nationally and temporally average yield loss was 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2% for wheat and 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8% for potato, calculated based on an area weighting. It was found that soil water deficit, observed frequently in the western part of Switzerland, had a large attenuation effect on stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake by wheat and on corresponding yield losses. This highlights the importance of including soil moisture limitation in O<sub>3</sub> uptake modelling even in moist climatic regions. The comparison of modelled evapotranspiration with water flux measurements over a wheat field showed a reasonable agreement concerning the temporal pattern and the magnitude. But it is also concluded that the DO<sub>3</sub>SE soil moisture module will need further testing and adaptation to improve accuracy of the model in dryer conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
