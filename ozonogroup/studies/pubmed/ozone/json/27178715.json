A more comprehensive assessment is important for understanding the contribution of phytoplankton production to the global carbon budget, present and future. Here, we consider responses in the temperate and tropical mid-ocean regions typically dominated by picophytoplankton including the prokaryotic lineages, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Spectral models of photosynthetic response for each lineage were constructed using model strains cultured at different growth irradiances and temperatures. In the model, inhibition becomes more severe once exposure exceeds a threshold (E<sub>max</sub> ) related to repair capacity. Model parameters are presented for Prochlorococcus adding to those previously presented for Synechococcus. The models were applied to estimate midday, water column photosynthesis based on an atmospheric model of spectral radiation, satellite-derived spectral water transparency and temperature. Based on a global survey of inhibitory exposure severity, a full-latitude section of the mid-Pacific and near-equatorial region of the east Pacific were identified as representative regions for prediction of responses over the entire water column. Comparing predictions integrated over the water column including versus excluding inhibition, production was 7-28% lower due to inhibition depending on strain and site conditions. Inhibition was consistently greater for Prochlorococcus compared to two strains of Synechococcus. Considering only the surface mixed layer, production was inhibited 7-73%. On average, including inhibition lowered estimates of midday productivity around 20% for the modeled region of the Pacific with UV accounting for two-thirds of the reduction. In contrast, most other productivity models either ignore inhibition or only include PAR inhibition. Incorporation of E<sub>max</sub> model responses into an existing spectral model of depth-integrated, daily production will enable efficient global predictions of picophytoplankton productivity including inhibition."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewater, MD, 21037, USA."}], "LastName": "Neale", "ForeName": "Patrick J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Washburn University, 1700 SW College Ave, Topeka, KS, 66604, USA."}], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Brian C", "Initials": "BC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Glob Chang Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9888746", "ISSNLinking": "1354-1013"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytoplankton"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Prochlorococcus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Synechococcus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27178715", "10.1111/gcb.13356"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
