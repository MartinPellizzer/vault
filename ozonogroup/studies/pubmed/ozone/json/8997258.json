To investigate the effect of SP on epithelial barrier function, we measured paracellular mannitol flux and the transepithelial potential difference (PD) of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and canine bronchial epithelial (CBE) cells. Incubation of confluent cell cultures with SP had no effect on baseline flux. However, pretreatment inhibited the flux-enhancing effects of 0.5 ppm ozone by 50% in HBE cells and 40% in CBE cells and inhibited the ozone-induced decrease in PD in CBE cells by 54%. SP-afforded protection was reduced by the neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonist CP-96,345.NK1 and NK3 receptor agonists also inhibited ozone-induced permeability, whereas an NK2 receptor agonist was without significant effect. These data indicate that SP exerts a protective effect on bronchial epithelial barrier function under conditions of challenge, which appears to be mediated in large part through NK1 receptors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Undem", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spannhake", "ForeName": "E W", "Initials": "EW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-49545", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P01 ES-03505", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P30 ES-03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33507-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Substance P"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W22ILA2I52", "NameOfSubstance": "CP 96345"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Junctions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance P"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8997258", "10.1152/ajplung.1996.271.6.L889"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
