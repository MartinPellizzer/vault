A series of TiO<sub>2</sub>-supported noble metal catalysts were synthesized by a facile impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts were evaluated for the catalytic oxidation of toluene. It was determined that the 1\u2005wt%Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibited outstanding performance that 65% conversion of toluene was achieved with the space velocity of 30,000\u2005h<sup>-1</sup> even at room temperature (25\u00b0C). The structure-activity relationship of various catalysts was investigated via BET, XRD, SEM, TEM as well as XPS. The results indicated that the uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles, abundant surface adsorbed oxygen species as well as the strong interaction between Pt and TiO<sub>2</sub> favoured toluene degradation at normal temperature. Based on FT-IR, a simplified reaction scheme was proposed: toluene was first oxidized to benzoate species then alcohol species, ketones, carboxyl acids, which was finally degraded into CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The low activation energy of 1\u2005wt%Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub> determined to be 47\u2005kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> also benefited for toluene degradation at ambient temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Mingze", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jiahao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shejiang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yingxin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5714-8290"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Jianfeng", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33315528", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1864482"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
