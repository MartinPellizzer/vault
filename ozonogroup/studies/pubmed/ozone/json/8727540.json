Among the endogenous compounds potentially vulnerable to oxidative injury are surfactant proteins. This study focused on the effect of ozone on surfactant protein A (SP-A) function, content, and gene expression. To determine the time course of response to ozone, guinea pigs were exposed to 0.2-0.8 parts/million (ppm) ozone for 6 h and were killed up to 120 h postexposure. To determine the effect of repeated exposure, animals were exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone for 6 h/day and were killed on days 3 and 5. A significant increase in surfactant's ability to modulate the respiratory burst induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in naive macrophages was observed at 24 h after a single 0.8 ppm ozone exposure. Because neutralizing antibodies to SP-A blunted this stimulatory effect, we hypothesized that ozone enhanced the modulatory role of SP-A in macrophage function. This alteration in function was accompanied by an influx of inflammatory cells and only marginal changes in SP-A levels as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No significant changes in steady-state levels of SP-A mRNA were observed after single or repeated exposure to ozone. Thus the inflammation that accompanies in vivo ozone exposure may result in a change in the structure and thus functional role of SP-A in modulating macrophage activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, Tuxedo 10987, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "W Y", "Initials": "WY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-02429", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-0256", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-04947", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8727540", "10.1152/jappl.1996.80.5.1560"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
