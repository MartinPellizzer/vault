The influencing factors and degradation kinetics were analyzed; quenching experiments were carried out; and the types of free radicals, succinate dehydrogenase activity, and denitrification function genes were determined. The results showed that the suitable ozonation condition was pH 8.0-8.5, O<sub>3</sub> concentration was approximately 35.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, O<sub>3</sub> dosage was approximately 100.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, and reaction time was 90.0-120.0 min. Organic nitrogen in the biochemical effluent by ozonation conformed to the pseudo first-order kinetic model, and the maximum rate constant <i>k</i> was 0.01035 min<sup>-1</sup> (experimental conditions:pH 8.0, ozone dosage 150.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, and ozone concentration 35.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>). Ozonation significantly improved the denitrification performance of the sequencing biofilm batch reactor (SBBR), and the denitrification efficiency increased from 19.8% (SBBR) to 32.9% (O<sub>3</sub>-SBBR). Ozonation could convert organic nitrogen and organic substances with strong toxicity and difficult biological utilization into small molecular substances with low toxicity and biodegradability. The abundance of functional genes (<i>nirS, nirK</i>, and <i>nor</i>) in the O<sub>3</sub>-SBBR combined process was significantly higher than that in the single SBBR, which further confirmed that ozonation could improve the nitrogen removal performance of SBBR. The operation cost of the combined process was 0.74-1.07 yuan\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, with good technical economy. This study provided a basis for the application of the O<sub>3</sub>-SBBR combined process in the advanced treatment of biochemical effluent in printing and dyeing industrial parks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Xin-Hao", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yong-You", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yuan-Cai", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Jian-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan City Jialida Environmental Protection Technology Corp., Foshan 528143, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan City Jialida Environmental Protection Technology Corp., Foshan 528143, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Yuan-Ge", "Initials": "YG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Printing, Three-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36775611", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202204136"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
