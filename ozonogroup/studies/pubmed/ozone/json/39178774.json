We did a population-based cross-sectional survey, including 177,888 children from 173 primary and middle schools in 14 Chinese cities. A satellite-based spatiotemporal model was employed to assess four-year average O<sub>3</sub> exposure at both residential and school locations. Information on asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema and conjunctivitis was collected by a standard questionnaire developed by the American Thoracic Society. We used generalized non-linear and linear mixed models to test the associations. We observed linear exposure-response associations between O<sub>3</sub> and all outcomes. The odds ratios of doctor-diagnosed asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and conjunctivitis associated with per interquartile increment in home-school O<sub>3</sub> concentration were 1.31 (95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28, 1.34), 1.25 (95\u00a0%CI: 1.23, 1.28), 1.19 (95\u00a0%CI: 1.16, 1.21), and 1.28 (95\u00a0%CI: 1.21, 1.34), respectively. Similar associations were observed for asthma-related outcomes including current asthma, wheeze, current wheeze, persistent phlegm, and persistent cough. Moreover, stronger associations were observed among children who were aged >\u00a012 years, physically inactive, and exposed to higher temperature. In conclusion, long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated with higher risks of asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and eczema in children."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
