As a consequence of modifying virgin AC, modified AC (ACN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) had good catalytic performance for ozonation of HA. Apparent first-order rate constants (k<sub>app</sub>) were ACN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> (7.88 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) > virgin AC (3.28 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). This change was discussed in terms of three factors: textural property, graphitization degree, and surface chemical property. From analysis results, it was deduced that the surface chemical property (the concentration of surface groups) was the main factor that influenced catalytic activity. An increase in the concentration of hydroxyl groups on AC enhanced catalytic activity of AC in ozonation of HA. Effects of phosphate (both a ligand and a strong Lewis base) further confirmed that Lewis acid sites (hydroxyl groups) were the active centers for free radical reaction in catalytic ozonation of AC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 16, South Section 2, the first Ring Road, Chengdu 610041, China E-mail: hlchensubmission@yahoo.com; hlchen@cioc.ac.cn; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 16, South Section 2, the first Ring Road, Chengdu 610041, China E-mail: hlchensubmission@yahoo.com; hlchen@cioc.ac.cn; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 16, South Section 2, the first Ring Road, Chengdu 610041, China E-mail: hlchensubmission@yahoo.com; hlchen@cioc.ac.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Honglin", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 16, South Section 2, the first Ring Road, Chengdu 610041, China E-mail: hlchensubmission@yahoo.com; hlchen@cioc.ac.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoming", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29698221", "10.2166/wst.2018.084"]}}]}
