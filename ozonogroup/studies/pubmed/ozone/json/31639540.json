Estimation of possible risk due to DBPs by calculation of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was attempted. The studied DBPs showed different formation behavior during chlorination, with maximum yields within 0.5-48\u202fh. Maximum cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was observed after 4\u202fh of chlorination with dibromoacetonitrile being the major contributor. Ozonation and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment resulted in increase of trichloronitromethane followed by a decline at higher doses, and reduction of haloacetonitriles. High ozone doses reduced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of treated effluents. The presence of bromide shifted to bromo-DBPs formation and enhanced both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Particulate fraction in effluents significantly contributed to the formation of DBPs and consequently to the their toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
