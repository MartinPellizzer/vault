Pseudo-first-order rate constants kapp and overall reactive uptake coefficients \u03b3 were acquired on the basis of changes in absorbance from peaks located near 1743, 1710, 1172, and 1110 cm(-1), which can be assigned to C\u2550O in ester, C\u2550O in acid, and C-C and C-O stretching modes, respectively. Results showed that the kapp and \u03b3 increased nearly by a factor of 6 with increasing temperatures from 258 to 314 K. It was noted the temperature effect on the reaction kinetics was much more pronounced at lower temperatures. Such behavior can be explained by a change in the physical state of LA at lower temperatures. In addition, kapp and \u03b3 were enhanced by 2-fold as the RH increased from 0 to 80%. Moreover, the effect of ozone concentration on the reaction kinetics was reported for the first time. kapp was found to display a Langmuir-Hinshelwood dependence on ozone concentration with KO3 = (1.146 \u00b1 0.017) \u00d7 10(-15) molecules cm(-3) and k[S] = 0.0522 \u00b1 0.0004 s(-1), where KO3 is a parameter that describes the partitioning of ozone to the thin film surface, and k[S] is the maximum pseudo-first-order coefficient at high ozone concentration. Furthermore, yields and hygroscopic properties of reaction products were also investigated by FTIR spectroscopy. The intensity ratio of two C\u2550O stretching bands, A1743/A1710, which was utilized as an indicator of the product yields, increased sharply with increasing temperatures in the lower temperature region (258-284 K), and then remained nearly constant in the higher temperature region (284-314 K). The product yields showed no significant variation with RH, for the intensity ratio of A1743/A1710 barely changed in the wide RH range 0-80%. Water uptake studies showed that the LA thin film absorbed water with an increasing RH, and the hygroscopicity of the thin film was enhanced after ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado 80217, United States."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Holladay", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Langlois", "ForeName": "Danielle", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yunhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9KJL21T0QJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Linoleic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Linoleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23347186", "10.1021/jp308304n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
