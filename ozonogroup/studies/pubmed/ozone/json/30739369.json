The patients were systemically healthy and 18 to 64\u00a0years of age. Periodontal parameters, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), percentage of bleeding on probing, percentage of pockets deeper than 5\u00a0mm and clinical attachment level (CAL), and percentage of \u22653\u00a0mm CAL, were evaluated at baseline and 3\u00a0months following periodontal therapy. All participants were treated non-surgically. Topical gaseous ozone was applied into periodontal pockets twice a week for 2\u00a0weeks during active periodontal therapy. Gingival crevicular fluid pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) were evaluated. All statistical data were analyzed using SPSS software.", "Total of 36 participants completed the study (18 males, 18 females). PI, GI, PD, percentage of bleeding on probing, percentage of pockets deeper than 5\u00a0mm and CAL, and percentage of \u22653\u00a0mm CAL were improved, and there were no significant differences between the two sides. All inflammatory parameters, PTX-3, Hs-CRP, and IL-1, were reduced at 3-month follow-up. Only the decrease in PTX-3 levels between baseline and 3-month follow-up was statistically significant.", "Ozone therapy did not have any additional effect on periodontal parameters. All cytokines were reduced after periodontal therapy.
