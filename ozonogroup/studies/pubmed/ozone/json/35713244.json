MOLI MSI experiments were realized with CeO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanopowders using a vacuum matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometer in the negative mode. The catalytic properties of these metal oxides allow FA cleavage from phospholipids under UV laser irradiation. At the same time, fragile ozonides produced at the sites of unsaturation decomposed, yielding four diagnostic ions specific for the C\u2550C positions. Advantageously, two MOLI MSI runs from a single tissue sprayed with the metal oxide suspension were performed. The first run prior to ozone derivatization revealed the distribution of FAs, while the second run after the reaction with ozone offered additional information about FA C\u2550C isomers. The developed procedure was demonstrated on MSI of a normal mouse brain and human colorectal cancer tissues uncovering the differential distribution of FAs down to the isomer level. Compared to the histological analysis, MOLI MSI showed the distinct distribution of specific FAs in different functional parts of the brain and in healthy and cancer tissues pointing toward its biological relevance. The developed technique can be directly adopted by laboratories with MALDI TOF analyzers and help in the understanding of the local FA metabolism in tissues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Koktav\u00e1", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Val\u00e1\u0161ek", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Bezdekov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Dominika", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7424-5949"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Prysiazhnyi", "ForeName": "Vadym", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Adamov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Barbora", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Bene\u0161", "ForeName": "Petr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3329-3108"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Navr\u00e1tilov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Jarmila", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Pathology, St. Anne's University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Hendrych", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Surgery, St. Anne's University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Vl\u010dek", "ForeName": "Petr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9819-1284"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Preisler", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8811-0719"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Bedna\u0159\u00edk", "ForeName": "Anton\u00edn", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35713244", "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c00551"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
