It also can remove 97% SO<sub>2</sub>. O<sub>2</sub> at a content of 2-8% was sufficient to conduct a good removal of NO and Hg<sup>0</sup>. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and hydroxyl radical (HO\u2022) were proved to be the major oxidants for the removal of Hg<sup>0</sup> and NO, respectively. High temperature facilitated NO removal but impaired Hg<sup>0</sup> removal. SO<sub>2</sub> greatly promoted the removal of NO and Hg<sup>0</sup> due to the formation of SO<sub>4</sub>\u2022<sup>-</sup>. The presence of Cl<sup>- and Br<sup>-</sup></sup>suppressed NO removal but promoted Hg<sup>0</sup> removal, because Cl<sup>-</sup> and Br<sup>-</sup>quenched HO\u2022 to produce Cl- and Br-radicals. The produced NO<sub>2</sub> could be totally absorbed by the Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> solution that followed the main reactor. The O<sub>3</sub> yield and the formation of HO\u2022 under different conditions were determined using iodine quantity method and electron spin resonance (ESR). The distributions of anion concentration and mercury proportion were obtained using ion chromatography (IC) and cold atom fluorescence spectrometry (AFS), and the main products were identified to be SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and HgO. The mechanisms of removal of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO and Hg<sup>0</sup> were speculated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
