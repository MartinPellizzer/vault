Herein, the effect of inhalable oxidizing gas pollutants on the pulmonary surfactant (PS, extracted from porcine lungs), a mixture of active lipids and proteins that plays an important role in maintaining normal respiratory mechanics, is investigated in terms of the interfacial chemistry using in-vitro experiments; and the oxidative stress induced by oxidizing gases in the simulated lung fluid (SLF) supplemented with the PS is explored. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> individually increased the surface tension of the PS and reduced its foaming ability; this was accompanied by the surface pressure-area isotherms of the PS monolayers shifting toward lower molecular areas, with O<sub>3</sub> exhibiting more severe effects than NO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, both O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in lipid peroxidation and protein damage to the PS. The formation of superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) was correlated with the decomposition of O<sub>3</sub> and the reactions of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> with antioxidants in the SLF. These radicals, in the presence of antioxidants, led to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH). Additionally, the direct oxidation of unsaturated lipids by O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> further caused an increase in the ROS content. This change in the ROS chemistry and increased <sup>\u2022</sup>OH production tentatively explain how inhalable oxidizing gases lead to oxidative stress and adverse health effects. In summary, our results indicated that inhaled O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure can significantly alter the interfacial properties of the PS, oxidize its active ingredients, and induce ROS formation in the SLF. The results of this study provide a basis for the elucidation of the potential hazards of inhaled oxidizing gas pollutants in the human respiratory system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
