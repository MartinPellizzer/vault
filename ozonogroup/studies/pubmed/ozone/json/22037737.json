This is especially true of ozonated fluids. The aim of this study was to investigate the bactericidal activity of ozonated water and that of a mixture of ozone and oxygen against biofilms.", "Eighteen clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibiting various levels of antibiotic sensitivity were investigated. Bacteria were cultured in biofilm form on polystyrene titration plates for periods of 2 to 72 hours. The biofilms formed in this way were exposed to in statu nascendi ozonated water produced in a prototype device that had been tested in clinical conditions, or to a mixture of oxygen and ozone generated in the same device. Live cells in the biofilm were stained with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) bromide solution. The degree of reduction of viable bacteria following ozone exposure was determined.", "Ozonated water was found to be an effective bactericidal agent against biofilms after as little as 30 seconds of exposure, while the bactericidal activity of the ozone-oxygen solution was much lower. Prolongation of the duration of biofilm exposure to the gaseous disinfectant to 40 minutes led to a reduction in the viable cell count, which nevertheless remained high.", "Unlike the ozone-oxygen mixture, ozonated water effectively destroys bacterial biofilms in vitro.<br />"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiotherapy, Second Medical Faculty, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. dariusz.bialoszewski@wum.edu.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bialoszewski", "ForeName": "Dariusz", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pietruczuk-Padzik", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalicinska", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bocian", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Czajkowska", "ForeName": "Magdalena", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bukowska", "ForeName": "Bozena", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyski", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Sci Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "9609063", "ISSNLinking": "1234-1010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EUY85H477I", "NameOfSubstance": "thiazolyl blue"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "De Boer HEL, Van Elzelingen-Dekker CM, et al.
