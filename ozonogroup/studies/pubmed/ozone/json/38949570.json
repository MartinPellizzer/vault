Currently, electrochemical reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O has gained increasing attention to remove N<sub>2</sub>O, but its product is worthless N<sub>2</sub>. Here, we propose a direct eight-electron (8<i>e</i>) pathway to electrochemically convert N<sub>2</sub>O into NH<sub>3</sub>. As a proof of concept, using density functional theory calculation, an Fe<sub>2</sub> double-atom catalyst (DAC) anchored by N-doped porous graphene (Fe<sub>2</sub>@NG) was screened out to be the most active and selective catalyst for N<sub>2</sub>O electroreduction toward NH<sub>3</sub> via the novel 8<i>e</i> pathway, which benefits from the unique bent N<sub>2</sub>O adsorption configuration. Guided by theoretical prediction, Fe<sub>2</sub>@NG DAC was fabricated experimentally, and it can achieve a high N<sub>2</sub>O-to-NH<sub>3</sub> Faradaic efficiency of 77.8% with a large NH<sub>3</sub> yield rate of 2.9 mg h<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> at -0.6 V vs RHE in a neutral electrolyte. Our study offers a feasible strategy to synthesize NH<sub>3</sub> from pollutant N<sub>2</sub>O with simultaneous N<sub>2</sub>O removal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Industrial Generic Technology Research Center for Alumics Materials, School of Physics and Electronic Information, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei, Anhui 235000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Special Functional Materials of Ministry of Education, and School of Materials Science and Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Donghai", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Special Functional Materials of Ministry of Education, and School of Materials Science and Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Special Functional Materials of Ministry of Education, and School of Materials Science and Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ziyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0606-2689"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Industrial Generic Technology Research Center for Alumics Materials, School of Physics and Electronic Information, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei, Anhui 235000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Special Functional Materials of Ministry of Education, and School of Materials Science and Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Dongwei", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nano Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101088070", "ISSNLinking": "1530-6984"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38949570", "10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c00576"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
