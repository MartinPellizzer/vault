Twenty hours after the (final) exposure, subjects inhaled a single dose of allergen and a sputum induction was performed 6-7 h later.", "In the subjects with rhinitis, the mean early-phase response of FEV1 and the number of > or = 20% reductions were significantly greater after exposure to 250 or 4 x 125 p.p.b. ozone compared with filtered air. In addition, most of the > or = 15% late-phase responses in FEV1 occurred after exposure to 4 x 125 p.p.b., as well as the strongest effects on sputum parameters. The rise in the number of eosinophils was statistically significant in both groups.
