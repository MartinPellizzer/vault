This study determined to what extent prior-recurrent contact impacts molecular-hemodynamic biomarkers underpinning cognition in current professional rugby union players with a history of concussion. Measurements were performed in 20 professional rugby union players with an average of 16 (interquartile range [IQR] 13-19) years playing history reporting 3 (IQR 1-4) concussions. They were compared to 17 sex-age-physical activity-and education-matched non-contact controls with no prior history of self-reported concussion. Venous blood was assayed directly for the ascorbate free radical (A<sup>\u2022-</sup> electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) nitric oxide metabolites (NO reductive ozone-based chemiluminescence) and select biomarkers of neurovascular unit integrity (NVU chemiluminescence/ELISA). Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv doppler ultrasound) was employed to determine basal perfusion and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to hyper/hypocapnia ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>CVR</mi> <mrow><msub><mi>CO</mi> <mn>2</mn></msub> <mi>Hyper</mi> <mo>/</mo> <mi>Hypo</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> ). Cognition was assessed by neuropsychometric testing. Elevated systemic oxidative-nitrosative stress was confirmed in the players through increased A<sup>\u2022-</sup> (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and suppression of NO bioavailability (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This was accompanied by a lower CVR range ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>CVR</mi> <mrow><msub><mi>CO</mi> <mn>2</mn></msub> <mi>Range</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> ; p\u00a0=\u00a00.045) elevation in neurofilament light-chain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and frontotemporal impairments in immediate-memory (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) delayed-recall (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048) and fine-motor coordination (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Accelerated cognitive decline subsequent to prior-recurrent contact and concussion history is associated with a free radical-mediated suppression of CVR and neuronal injury providing important mechanistic insight that may help better inform clinical management."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
