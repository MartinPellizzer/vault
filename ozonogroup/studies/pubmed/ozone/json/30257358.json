Ozone water, also known as O<sub>3,</sub> has been previously reported to be a distinctly effective agent in treating inflammation. During the present study, we asserted the hypothesis that O<sub>3</sub> could be applied by pelvic inflammation and works to regulate the expression of inflammatory factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). In an attempt to evaluate the effect of O<sub>3</sub> on PID, an acute PID rat model was subsequently established. O<sub>3</sub> at concentrations of 45\u2009\u03bcg/mL and 60\u2009\u03bcg/mL in addition to levofloxacin (LVLX) was injected respectively into the PID rats in a bid to alter the contents of inflammatory factors and immunologic markers. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was applied to analyze endometrial inflammation. Reductions to the contents of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were recorded, while that of IL-2, IgA, IgG, IgM, C3 and C4, and E rosette formation rate and transformation rate of T lymphocytes exhibited notably elevated levels after the PID rats had been injected with 45\u2009\u03bcg/mL O<sub>3</sub>, 60\u2009\u03bcg/mL O<sub>3</sub> or LVLX. The pathological condition of the endometrium in rats with PID was alleviated among the PID rats after injected with the 45\u2009\u03bcg/mL O<sub>3</sub>, 60\u2009\u03bcg/mL O<sub>3</sub> or LVLX. Taken together, the key findings of the current study present evidence demonstrating that the administration of O<sub>3</sub> to the pelvic cavity ameliorated the PID conditions among rat models via inhibition of the necrosis of the endometrial epithelial cells as well as alleviated the inflammatory reactions, highlighting a potential novel PID treatment target."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
