OPR observation (Obs-OPR) and OPR modelling (Mod-OPR) have been obtained from observed and modelled peroxy radicals and nitrogen oxides. However, discrepancies between them remind of an imperfect understanding of O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry. Direct measurement of OPR (Mea-OPR) by a twin-chamber system emerges. Herein, we optimized Mea-OPR design, i.e., minimizing the chamber surface area to volume ratio (S/V) to 9.8\u00a0m<sup>-1</sup> from 18\u00a0m<sup>-1</sup> and the dark uptake coefficient of O<sub>3</sub> to 9.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-9</sup> from 7.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-8</sup> in the literature. In addition, control experiments further revealed and quantified a photo-enhanced O<sub>3</sub> uptake, and therefore recommended an essential correction of Mea-OPR. We finally characterized a measurement uncertainty of \u00b138% and a detection limit of 3.2\u00a0ppbv\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> (3SD), which suggested that Mea-OPR would be sensitive enough to measure OPR in urban or suburban environments. Further application of this system in urban Beijing during the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games recorded a noontime OPR of 7.3 (\u00b13.3, 1SD) ppbv h<sup>-1</sup>. These observational results added up to our confidence in future field application of Mea-OPR, to facilitate pollution control policy evaluation and to shed light on O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry puzzle."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
