The second order rate constants of reactions between ACMP and both molecular ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) were determined to be 0.25M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and 2.1\u00b710<sup>9</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. On the basis of kinetic results, the degradation of ACMP during ozonation could be well-explained by the reactivity of this pesticide with OH. HPLC/MS analysis of the ozonated ACMP showed ACMP-N-desmethyl, 6-chloronicotinic acid, N'cyano-N-methyl acetamidine and N'-cyano acetamidine as the major transformation products (TPs), all of them formed through amine \u03b1 carbon oxidation in combination with hydrolysis. Microtox bioassays revealed an increase in the toxicity of the medium during ACMP ozonation process, followed by a decrease to relatively low values. These changes could be attributed to the synergistic effects between TPs as well as to the presence of toxic intermediate aldehydes. Even though adopting strategies to further promote ozone decomposition to hydroxyl radicals appears to be essential, ozonation can be an effective treatment process for ACMP removal and associated toxicity abatement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
