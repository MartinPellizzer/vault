One of the perplexing aspects to asthma is that the prevalence is increasing in most industrialized countries. The reasons for this widespread increase are largely unknown. Another aspect of industrialization is the persistence of air pollution in urban areas. Because much air pollution is due to vehicles, no solution appears in sight. The topic of this article is the association between air pollution and various signs and symptoms of asthma. Air pollution is convincingly associated with many signs of asthma aggravation. These include pulmonary function decrements, increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, visits to emergency departments, hospital admissions, increased medication use and symptom reporting, inflammatory changes, interactions between air pollution and allergen challenges, and immune system changes. With the exception of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, common air pollutants have not been shown to cause asthma. It seems prudent for clinicians to counsel their patients about the potential risks of asthma aggravation from common outdoor air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash. 98195, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koenig", "ForeName": "J Q", "Initials": "JQ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES 07033", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Admission"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}], "NumberOfReferences": "52"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10518814", "10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70280-0", "S0091-6749(99)70280-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
