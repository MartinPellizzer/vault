In this work, the intermediates, probable degradation pathways and toxicity changes during ozonation of BP-4 in aqueous solution were systematically investigated. Results revealed that alkaline conditions favored the oxidation of BP-4. However, inorganic anions (Cl(-), NO3(-), SO4(2-)), cations (K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+)) and humic acid had no remarkable effect on BP-4 removal within the tested concentrations. Ozonation was also effective for the fast removal of BP-4 in real waters. The TOC suggested a low mineralization rate, even after the complete BP-4 removal. Meanwhile, the treated mixtures exhibited an obvious inhibition to the bioluminescent bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum, indicating the formation of transformation products with higher toxicities. Furthermore, fourteen products were identified by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Notably, seven of them have not been reported previously. The quenching test indicated that the degradation processes probably were dominated by OH. Next, possible degradation pathways were proposed and further justified by theoretical calculations of frontier electron densities. This investigation will contribute to the systematic elucidation of the ozonation process of UV filters in aquatic environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
