The studied ozone pollution time series exhibits distinct seasonality and secular trends and is associated with various factors. This study developed an interpretable hybrid model by combining STL decomposition and the Transformer (STL-Transformer) with the prior information of ozone time series and global multi-source information as prediction basis. The STL decomposition decomposes ozone time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components. Then, the three components, along with other air quality and meteorological data, are integrated into the input sequence of the Transformer. The experiment results show that the STL-Transformer outperforms the other five state-of-the-art models, including the standard Transformer. Specially, the univariate forecasting for ozone relies on mimicking the patterns and trends that have occurred in the past. In contrast, multivariate forecasting can effectively capture complex relationships and dependencies involving multiple variables. The method successfully grasps the prior and global multi-source information and simultaneously improves the interpretability of ozone prediction with high precision. This study provides new insights for air pollution forecasting and has reliable theoretical value and practical significance for environmental governance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
