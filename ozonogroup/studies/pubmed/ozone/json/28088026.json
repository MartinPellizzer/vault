Elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] has been documented in tropical evergreen forests, the epicenters of terrestrial primary productivity and plant-consumer interactions. However, the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on vegetation have not previously been studied in these forests. In this study, we quantified ambient O<sub>3</sub> in a region shared by forests and urban/commercial zones in Panama and found levels two to three times greater than in remote tropical sites. We examined the effects of these ambient O<sub>3</sub> levels on the growth and chemistry of seedlings of Ficus insipida, a regionally widespread tree with high stomatal conductance, using open-top chambers supplied with ozone-free or ambient air. We evaluated the differences across treatments in biomass and, using UPLC-MS-MS, leaf secondary metabolites and membrane lipids. Mean [O<sub>3</sub>] in ambient air was below the levels that induce chronic stress in temperate broadleaved trees, and biomass did not differ across treatments. However, leaf secondary metabolites - including phenolics and a terpenoid - were significantly downregulated in the ambient air treatment. Membrane lipids were present at lower concentrations in older leaves grown in ambient air, suggesting accelerated senescence. Thus, in a tree species with high O<sub>3</sub> uptake via high stomatal conductance, current ambient [O<sub>3</sub>] in Panamanian forests are sufficient to induce chronic effects on leaf chemistry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
