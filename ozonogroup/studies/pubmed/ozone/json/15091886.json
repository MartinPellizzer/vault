In view of this, and to provide knowledge for later field experiments, dose-response studies with EDU and O3 were carried out in greenhouses in winter and spring 1989, using radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cv. 'Cherry Belle' and 'Red Prince', grown in two different substrates. EDU was applied as a single or repeated soil drench in concentrations ranging from 300 to 800 mg litre(-1) in the first, and from 100 to 400 mg litre(-1) in the second trial. In the second experiment, plants were exposed to a chronic level of O3, mimicking ambient patterns, or to filtered air after the EDU-treatment. When applied in concentrations above 300 mg litre(-1), EDU reduced growth, thereby affecting the development of the thickened hypocotyl far more than the shoot growth that was partially stimulated by lower doses of EDU. Phytotoxic symptoms on the leaves, attributable to EDU, were observed at concentrations above 200 mg litre(-1), but complete protection from visible O3-injury was provided by a single application of EDU at a concentration as low as 100 mg litre(-1). Significant interactions on growth characters measured between O3-exposure and EDU application were observed only in one of the substrates. While these results demonstrate the need for careful dose-response studies prior to field assessments, they also provide evidence of a dosage that is effective in protecting radish from O3 damage without interfering with plant growth itself."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kostka-Rick", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manning", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091886", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90097-8", "0269749193900978"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
