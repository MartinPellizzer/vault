SEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS and BET analyses were performed to characterize the biochar (BC) catalysts. Zn@SBC-CD had high graphitization degree, abundant active sites and uniform distribution of Zn on its surface. Complete removal of MB was achieved within 10\u00a0min, with a removal rate much higher than that of ozone alone (32.4%), implying the excellent ozone activation performance of Zn@SBC-CD. The influence of experimental parameters on MB removal efficiency was examined. Under the optimum conditions in terms of ozone dose 0.04\u00a0mg/mL, catalyst dose 400\u00a0mg/L and pH 6.0, COD was completely removed after 20\u00a0min. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis revealed radical and non-radical pathways were involved in MB degradation. The Zn@SBC-CD/O<sub>3</sub> system generated superoxide anion radicals (<sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), which were the main active species for MB removal, through adsorption, transformation, and transfer, Furthermore, Zn@SBC-CD exhibited good reusability and stability in cycling experiments. This study provides a novel approach for the utilization of cow dung and sludge in synthesis of functional biocatalysts and application in organic wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
