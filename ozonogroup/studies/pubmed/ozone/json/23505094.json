To investigate the processes affecting grain quality under altered CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> , we analysed 57 experiments with CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> exposure in different exposure systems. The study covered 24 cultivars studied in 112 experimental treatments from 11 countries. A significant growth dilution effect on grain protein was found: a change in grain yield of 10% by O<sub>3</sub> was associated with a change in grain protein yield of 8.1% (R<sup>2</sup> =0.96), while a change in yield effect of 10% by CO<sub>2</sub> was linked to a change in grain protein yield effect of 7.5% (R<sup>2</sup> =0.74). Superimposed on this effect, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> , but not O<sub>3</sub> , had a significant negative effect on grain protein yield also in the absence of effects on grain yield, indicating that there exists a process by which CO<sub>2</sub> restricts grain protein accumulation, which is absent for O<sub>3</sub> . Grain mass, another quality trait, was more strongly affected by O<sub>3</sub> than grain number, while the opposite was true for CO<sub>2</sub> . Harvest index was strongly and negatively influenced by O<sub>3</sub> , but was unaffected by CO<sub>2</sub> . We conclude that yield vs. protein trade-offs for wheat in response to CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> are constrained by close relationships between effects on grain biomass and less than proportional effects on grain protein. An important and novel finding was that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> has a direct negative effect on grain protein accumulation independent of the yield effect, supporting recent evidence of CO<sub>2</sub> -induced impairment of nitrate uptake/assimilation. Finally, our results demonstrated that processes underlying responses of grain yield vs. quality trade-offs are very different in wheat exposed to elevated O<sub>3</sub> compared to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> ."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Gothenburg, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, P.O.
