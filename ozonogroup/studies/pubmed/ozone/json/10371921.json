The quantities of ozone generated by both methods were the same (20 mg/h). In method A, ozone was generated for 10 minutes every 12 hours and in method B, ozone was generated over 24 hours a day. Test specimens of 3 types of dental alloy (Co-Cr, Au-Ag-Pt, and Au-Cu-Ag-Pd) were subjected to different cleaning methods for 7 days and measured in terms of reflectance, surface roughness, and weight. Five different cleaning solutions (three commercial denture cleaners, acid-electrolyzed water with a pH of 2.4, and pure water) were used for comparison with the ozone treatments.", "No significant changes were detected after treatment of the Co-Cr and Au-Ag-Pt alloys with ozone. Ozone caused a slight change in the Au-Cu-Ag-Pd alloy in terms of reflectance, but the changes were significantly less than those caused by acid-electrolyzed water and one of the commercial denture cleaners.", "Ozone had little influence on the oxidation of dental alloys."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatric Dentistry, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Faculty of Dentistry, Japan. t.suzuki.gero@dent.tmd.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oizumi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Furuya", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okamoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenstiel", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Prosthodont", "NlmUniqueID": "8900938", "ISSNLinking": "0893-2174"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium Alloys"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Alloys"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Denture Cleansers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold Alloys"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49DFR088MY", "NameOfSubstance": "Platinum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5TWQ1V240M", "NameOfSubstance": "Palladium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium Alloys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Corrosion"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Alloys"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Denture Cleansers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denture, Partial, Removable"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gold Alloys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Palladium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Platinum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10371921"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
