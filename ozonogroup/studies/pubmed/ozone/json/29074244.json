A major concern associated with the burning is the contribution of smoke to elevated ground level ambient ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). The objective of this study is to estimate contributions of Kansas rangeland burning to ambient O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratios through regression analysis (1) between observed O<sub>3</sub> data and available satellite burn activity data from 2001 to 2016; and (2) between observed O<sub>3</sub> data and the smoke contributions to PM<sub>2.5</sub> which were resolved from receptor modeling. Positive correlations were observed between ambient O<sub>3</sub> levels and the acres burned each year estimated from satellite imagery. When burned acres in April were larger than or equal to 1.9 million, O<sub>3</sub>>70ppb occurred at least at one of the ten monitoring sites in Kansas. Statistical regression models of daily maximum 8-hour O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratios were developed at each of the ten monitoring sites using meteorological predictors. The O<sub>3</sub> model residuals that were not explained by the meteorological effect models were affected by PM<sub>2.5</sub> contributors including sulfate/industrial sources and emissions that generated secondary organic particles, such as rangeland burning, which were derived from receptor modeling. The average O<sub>3</sub> model residual on the high O<sub>3</sub> days in April was 21\u00b19ppb, which was likely associated with smoke emissions from burning. Research will continue to obtain daily satellite burn activity data and to correlate burn data with daily O<sub>3</sub> data, so that modeling of O<sub>3</sub> levels can be improved under influences of daily burn activities. Less frequency of high O<sub>3</sub> days was observed in April since 2011, which may be partly due to implementation of the Flint Hills Smoke Management Plan which promoted better timing of burns."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
