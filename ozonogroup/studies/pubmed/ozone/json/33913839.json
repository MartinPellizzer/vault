Patients with a clinical diagnosis of MKC in at least one eye with an acute onset (\u22641 week) of presentation were included as cases. Correlation analysis was performed with the local environmental temperature, rainfall, humidity, and windspeed (Telangana State Development and Planning Society) and air pollution (Central Pollution Control Board, Government of India).", "Overall, 84 (0.05%) patients were diagnosed with acute onset MKC from the district of Hyderabad. The mean monthly prevalence in this cohort was 0.05% with peak prevalence in the months of July (0.08%), August (0.09%), September (0.12%), and October (0.08%). The environmental parameters of rainfall (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.87/P = < 0.0001), humidity (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.78/P = 0.0001), windspeed (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.38/P = 0.0321) were significantly positively correlated and the air pollution parameters such as ground level ozone (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.89/P = < 0.0001), particulate matter PM<sub>10</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.65/P = 0.0013), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.50/P = 0.0095), nitrogen dioxide (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.53/P = 0.0071), and carbon monoxide (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.69/P = 0.0008) were significantly negatively correlated with the temporal pattern of MKC in the population.", "Parasitic infections like MKC show a distinct temporal trend peaking during the monsoon season in the population. An increase in humidity, wind speed, and especially rainfall contributes to a higher prevalence of MKC cases during the year. An increase in ground-level ozone seems to be protective against infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of EyeSmart EMR and AEye, L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Anthony Vipin", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Cornea Institute; Center for Ocular Regeneration (CORE), L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Basu", "ForeName": "Sayan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Ophthalmol", "NlmUniqueID": "0405376", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4738"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Keratoconjunctivitis"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sharma S, Das S, Joseph J, Vemuganti GK, Murthy S.
