We first merged these data sets and developed a unified model using machine learning (ML), which showed better predictive performance than the individual models for HClO (RMSE<sub>test</sub>: 2.1 to 2.04), O<sub>3</sub> (2.06 to 1.94), ClO<sub>2</sub> (1.77 to 1.49), and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> (0.75 to 0.70) because the model \"corrected\" the wrongly learned effects of several atom groups. We further developed knowledge transfer models for three pairs of the data sets and observed different predictive performances: improved for O<sub>3</sub> (RMSE<sub>test</sub>: 2.06 to 2.01)/HClO (2.10 to 1.98), mixed for O<sub>3</sub> (2.06 to 2.01)/ClO<sub>2</sub> (1.77 to 1.95), and unchanged for ClO<sub>2</sub> (1.77 to 1.77)/HClO (2.1 to 2.1). The effectiveness of the latter approach depended on whether there was consistent knowledge shared between the data sets and on the performance of the individual models. We also compared our approaches with multitask learning and image-based transfer learning and found that our approaches consistently improved the predictive performance for all data sets while the other two did not. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of combining small, similar data sets and transferring knowledge between them to improve ML model performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, 2104 Adelbert Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-7201, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Shifa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin 300401, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yanping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5683-5117"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, 2104 Adelbert Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-7201, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Huichun", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Machine Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34908403", "10.1021/acs.est.1c04883"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
