Albis) was grown in open-top chambers and exposed to four different levels of ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) from the three-leaf stage until maturity. The aim was to examine changes in leaf and canopy gas exchange, and in chlorophyll fluorescence, in response to O<sub>3</sub> flux. Measurements were carried out periodically between full expansion and complete senescence of flag leaves. Fluxes to the canopy of CO<sub>2</sub> (CER<sub>c</sub> .) (corrected for soilborne CO<sub>2</sub> ), water vapour (E<sub>c</sub> ) and O<sub>3</sub> were determined by using open-top chambers as differential systems. Water use efficiency (WUE<sub>c</sub> .) was calculated from CER<sub>c</sub> , and E<sub>c</sub> . Leaf CO<sub>2</sub> (CER<sub>n</sub> ) and H<sub>2</sub> O (E<sub>n</sub> ) exchange rates, stomatal conductance (g,(H<sub>2</sub> O)), and WUE<sub>n</sub> , were analyzed with a portable gas exchange analyzer. Effects of O<sub>3</sub> flux on structural components of photosynthesis were examined by determining variable fluorescence (defined by the F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>o</sub> ratio) in leaves after 60 minutes of dark-adaptation or during the night. The decline in CER<sub>c</sub> and CER<sub>n</sub> associated with senescence was accelerated by O<sub>3</sub> . Average CER<sub>n</sub> between flag leaf unfolding and late milk stage declined linearly with increasing O<sub>3</sub> flux. The corresponding decline in average CER<sub>c</sub> was less pronounced. The quantitative effect of O<sub>3</sub> flux on CER<sub>c</sub> corresponded well with the effect on grain yield. In young leaves, g<sub>s</sub> (H<sub>2</sub> O) was reduced in response to O<sub>3</sub> but WUE<sub>n</sub> was unaffected. With progressing leaf age, WUE<sub>n</sub> declined. Thus, in the young leaves, O<sub>3</sub> affected the stomata directly and, consequently, limitation of photosynthesis was primarily due to reduced CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion. In contrast, in senescent leaves, the effect of O<sub>3</sub> was mainly due to reduced carboxylation. Compared with WUE<sub>n</sub> WUE<sub>c</sub> responded differently to increasing O<sub>3</sub> flux. During O<sub>2</sub> fluxes at above-ambient levels, WUE<sub>C</sub> tended to increase rather than to decrease. It is suggested that under O<sub>3</sub> stress, factors controlling WUE at the canopy level differ from those operating at the level of single flag leaves. The decline in F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>o</sub> measured after anthesis was stimulated by O<sub>2</sub> , but no effect of O<sub>3</sub> was detected when F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>o</sub> was measured during the night. This leads to the conclusion that the effect of O<sub>3</sub> on photosynthetic structures is reversible and the reduction in photosynthesis in response to O<sub>3</sub> flux is due to metabolic changes rather than to direct damage to structural components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Chemistry and Environmental Hygiene, CH-3097 Liebefeld-Bern, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grimm", "ForeName": "A Grandjean", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Chemistry and Environmental Hygiene, CH-3097 Liebefeld-Bern, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuhrer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Aben, J.
