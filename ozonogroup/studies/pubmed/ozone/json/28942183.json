The energetic yields (G<sub>50</sub>) as measure of the efficiencies of the different methods are for 2,4-D in the order DBD/Ar-Fenton>ozonation>DBD/Ar>P.C.ozonation>DBD/Ar:O<sub>2</sub>\u226bDBD/Air>P.C.oxidation. For 2,4-DCP the order is ozonation\u226bDBD/Ar-Fenton>P.C.ozonation>DBD/Ar>DBD/Ar:O<sub>2</sub>\u226bP.C.oxidation>DBD/Air. The degradation by using ozone is very effective, but it should be noted that the mineralization measured by the total organic carbon (TOC) removal is low. The reason is the formation of stable towards ozone intermediates, especially low chain carboxylic acids. The fate of these intermediates during the degradation with the different methods has been followed and discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
