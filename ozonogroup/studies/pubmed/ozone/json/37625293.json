To this end, the secondary metal Zn and Si-F group were introduced into the framework of FeM to create surface potential difference and hydrophobic sites. Comparative characterizations showed that there existed rich acid sites with great potential difference on F-Fe-Zn-MCM-41 (FFeZnM). Additionally, because of the existence of hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing Si-F unit, the electron migration ability, hydrophobicity and acidity of FFeZnM were enhanced. The greater O<sub>3</sub> mass transfer was induced by Si-F group and O<sub>3</sub> was directly activated at Fe and Zn Lewis acid sites into \u2022OH, \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. With \u2022OH acting as main species, FFeZnM/O<sub>3</sub> achieved the superior IBP removal (93.4%, 30\u00a0min) and TOC removal (46.6%, 120\u00a0min) over those of sole O<sub>3</sub> and F-FeM/O<sub>3</sub> processes, respectively. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> hindered IBP degradation by FFeZnM/O<sub>3</sub>, but high concentration humic acid (HA) exhibited promotion by forming HA-IBP complex. IBP degradation by FFeZnM/O<sub>3</sub> was enhanced with tap water, river water, and effluent from the secondary sedimentation tank of the sewage plant acting as medium. This study proposed an innovative approach to catalyst design for catalytic ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
