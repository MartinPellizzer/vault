This test measures changes in the ability of the RBC to deform--as occurs during passage through small capillaries. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to 1.0, 0.7, or 0.3 ppm O3 for 4 hr, and blood samples were obtained by heart puncture. RBCs were suspended in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mg/dl glucose. After incubation in air for up to 6 hr, the time required for 2 ml RBC suspension to pass through a 3-micron-pore-size polycarbonate filter was determined. A significant increase in the 6-hr filtration time for O3-exposed (1.0 ppm) mice over unexposed mice and a lack of protection by vitamin E were shown. The increases in RBC filtration times for O3-exposed mice appeared to be dose related. Ozone exposure (1.0 ppm) caused a significant increase in the hematocrit of both vitamin E-deficient and -supplemented mice. Vitamin E supplementation appeared to partially prevent this increase in hematocrit. Measurement of lipid peroxidation by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test revealed no detectable levels of TBA-reactive material in RBC from O3-exposed mice. These results suggest that measurement of RBC filterability may be feasible as a clinical test for short-term injury from exposure to oxidant gases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dorsey", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Menzel", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8200838", "ISSNLinking": "0272-0590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Deformability"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hematocrit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3987990", "10.1016/0272-0590(85)90057-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
