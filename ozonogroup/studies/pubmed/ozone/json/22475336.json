With the discovery of a mass-independent isotopic fractionation during the formation of ozone, a new physical chemical basis for isotope effects required development. Combined theoretical and experimental developments have broadened this understanding and extended the range of chemical systems where these unique effects occur. Simultaneously, the application of mass-independent isotopic measurements to an extensive range of both terrestrial and extraterrestrial systems has furthered the understanding of events such as solar system origin and evolution and planetary atmospheric chemistry, present and past."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, 92093, USA. mthiemens@ucsd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thiemens", "ForeName": "Mark H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chakraborty", "ForeName": "Subrata", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dominguez", "ForeName": "Gerardo", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Annu Rev Phys Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "15040080R", "ISSNLinking": "0066-426X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22475336", "10.1146/annurev-physchem-032511-143657"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
