Development of an effective, feasible, cost-effective and eco-friendly approach for treating wastewater that is discharged from various industries is important for bringing down the deposition of contaminants into environment. Advanced oxidation process is an efficient technique for treating wastewater owing to its advantages such as high oxidation efficacy and does not produce any secondary pollutants. Advanced oxidation process can be performed through various methods such as ozone, Fenton, electrochemical, photolysis, sonolysis, etc. These methods have been widely utilized for degradation of emerging pollutants that cannot be destroyed using conventional approaches. This review focuses on wastewater treatment using advanced oxidation process. A brief discussion on mechanism involved is provided. In addition, various types of advanced oxidation process and their mechanism are explained in detail. Challenges faced during wastewater treatment process using oxidation, electrochemical, Fenton, photocatalysis and sonolysis are discussed elaborately. Advanced oxidation process can be viewed as potential approach for treating wastewater with certain modifications and solving challenges."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
