This study examines the association between air pollutants and diagnoses made at outpatient visits to a family practice center during an acute episode of air pollution. A strong positive correlation was found between average weekly pollutant levels and the percentage of diagnoses of respiratory tract and cardiac illnesses. Not only do these findings add to the growing evidence of untoward health effects of air pollution; they also suggest a simple method of monitoring such effects in an ambulatory setting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lutz", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Fam Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "7502590", "ISSNLinking": "0094-3509"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ambulatory Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6822801"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
