These studies of the HGB region have provided guidance on the conditions that are used herein to identify specific meteorological parameters that relate with observed exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone. These parameters were developed using 15\u00a0years of ozone concentrations and localized wind conditions enhanced by incorporating data from a private monitoring network. Using these data, several key parameters were found that described the most common meteorological conditions for an exceedance day in HGB. The most relevant parameters included: the wind direction at midnight, wind speeds from 0 to 6 LST, and the extent of wind direction rotation in a 24-hour period. These parameters, and the meteorological conditions they describe, were also found to occur in an analysis of observational data throughout the state of Texas suggesting large scale forces beyond the influence of a sea breeze. A mixed layer model was developed and shown to illustrate the large-scale synoptic forces found in the observational data. The meteorological parameters, and conditions they describe, could be part of a diagnostic model performance evaluation to assure that accurate predictions of ozone for Texas were not the result of compensating errors.<i>Implications</i>: This study identified meteorological-based parameters that coincided with observed exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone across the state of Texas. These parameters can be used in support of regulatory model performance evaluations to assure accuracy in predicting ozone conducive conditions. In Houston, the vast majority of meteorlogical ozone conducive days did not produce an exceedance, suggesting other as yet unidentified conditions that are necessary such as an intermittent emission of precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1399-2948"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Sciences & Engineering, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Vizuete", "ForeName": "William", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA."}], "LastName": "Nielsen-Gammon", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA."}], "LastName": "Dickey", "ForeName": "Judy", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Education, University of North Carolina, Asheville, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Couzo", "ForeName": "Evan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Envair, Albany, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Blanchard", "ForeName": "Charles", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Texas Commission Environmental Quality, Austin, Texas, USA."}], "LastName": "Breitenbach", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington State, USA."}], "LastName": "Rasool", "ForeName": "Quazi Z", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Byun", "ForeName": "Daewon", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35404771", "10.1080/10962247.2022.2064004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
