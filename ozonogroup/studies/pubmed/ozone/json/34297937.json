Exposures to 11 air pollutants were estimated for the hour of ultrasound and each of the 2\u00a0h prior to ultrasound at the clinics using the National Air Quality Forecast Capability reanalysis products. We used mixed logistic regression to study the longitudinal odds ratio (OR) of any, uni- or bi-lateral systolic and diastolic uterine artery notching compared to no notching and the longitudinal OR of abnormal end diastolic flow of the umbilical artery compared to forward flow. Uterine and umbilical artery resistance indexes were studied using linear mixed models.", "Each inter-quartile range (IQR) increase of particulate matter\u00a0<\u00a02.5 \u03bcm, nitrate, ammonium, primary organic matter (POM) and nitrogen dioxide during the hour of ultrasound was associated with a decreased risk of unilateral systolic notch and with increased resistance index of the left uterine artery. For the umbilical artery, each IQR increase in ozone was associated with decreased resistance index (b: -0.26, 95\u00a0% CI: -0.52, -0.01) and with a decreased risk of abnormal end diastolic flow (OR: 0.36, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.14, 0.94); while each IQR increase of elemental carbon and POM was associated with increased risk of abnormal end diastolic flow (OR: 1.47, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.02, 2.13 and OR: 1.67, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.17, 2.39, respectively).", "Our results suggest acute air pollution exposure may influence placental vascular resistance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Ouidir", "ForeName": "Marion", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Tekola-Ayele", "ForeName": "Fasil", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Canty", "ForeName": "Timothy", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Grantz", "ForeName": "Katherine L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Christiana Care Health System, Newark, DE, USA."}], "LastName": "Sciscione", "ForeName": "Anthony", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Spatial Science and Systems, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Rena R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Sundaram", "ForeName": "Rajeshwari", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of North Dakota, School of Medicine & Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND, USA."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Andrew", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Stevens", "ForeName": "Danielle", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD, USA; Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.
