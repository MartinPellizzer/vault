The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> volume fractions were generally higher from April to September and lower from October to the following March. During the study period\uff0c O<sub>3</sub> pollution represented by <i>\u03c6</i>\uff08MDA8O<sub>3</sub>\uff09\uff0c i.e.\uff0c the maximum daily 8-h average of O<sub>3</sub> volume fractions\uff0c was the most serious at the Jincheng and Linfen stations in the south of Shanxi\uff0c followed by that in the Wutaishan\uff0c Shuozhou\uff0c and Datong stations in the north\uff0c with the least pollution occurring at the Taiyuan station in the middle. There were differences between the urban and alpine stations\uff0c although their seasonal O<sub>3</sub> volume fractions were both summer &gt; spring &gt; autumn &gt; winter. O<sub>3</sub> volume fractions at the urban station were usually lower than those at the alpine station\uff1b O<sub>3</sub> at the urban station might have been influenced by photochemical reactions with precursor NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>\uff1b however\uff0c this was not the main source of high O<sub>3</sub> at the alpine station. The peak and valley values appeared at 15\uff1a00 and 06\uff1a00\uff0c respectively\uff0c at the urban station\uff0c whereas they appeared at 20\uff1a00 and 10\uff1a00\uff0c respectively\uff0c at the alpine station\uff0c representing diametrically opposite diurnal variation patterns. Further\uff0c the daily amplitude of O<sub>3</sub> at the urban station was much larger than that at the alpine station. For urban stations specifically\uff0c temperature was the most important meteorological factor affecting O<sub>3</sub> volume fraction\uff0c compared with sunlight hours\uff0c precipitation\uff0c and total cloud cover. The NO<sub>2</sub> volume fraction in the daytime affected the daily amplitude of O<sub>3</sub>\uff1b although the photochemical generation potential of O<sub>3</sub> at the Taiyuan station was good\uff0c the O<sub>3</sub> volume fractions were the lowest among urban stations due to strong NO titration. The higher O<sub>3</sub> corresponded to lower NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> in which NO<sub>2</sub> was dominant\uff0c and the higher NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> was largely composed of NO\uff0c under which conditions O<sub>3</sub> would be depleted completely. The surface wind that affected O<sub>3</sub> volume fractions of all stations primarily came from the southeast\uff0c south\uff0c and southwest\uff0c and specific wind speed led to the increase in O<sub>3</sub> volume fraction. The geographical situation of the station would cause the difference in the transport of atmospheric pollutants\uff0c whereas the horizontal transmissions of high O<sub>3</sub> from the North China Plain and Fenwei Plain were likely to be the common reason for the increase in O<sub>3</sub> volume fraction in Shanxi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Branch of Monitoring and Assessment Center for GHGs & Carbon Neutrality, China Meteorological Administration, Shanxi Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Branch of Monitoring and Assessment Center for GHGs & Carbon Neutrality, China Meteorological Administration, Shanxi Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-Min", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Branch of Monitoring and Assessment Center for GHGs & Carbon Neutrality, China Meteorological Administration, Shanxi Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Kun-Ning", "Initials": "KN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Branch of Monitoring and Assessment Center for GHGs & Carbon Neutrality, China Meteorological Administration, Shanxi Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Shi-Ming", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Weather Modification and Lightning Protection Technical Center, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hong-Ping", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Branch of Monitoring and Assessment Center for GHGs & Carbon Neutrality, China Meteorological Administration, Shanxi Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng-Sheng", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Branch of Monitoring and Assessment Center for GHGs & Carbon Neutrality, China Meteorological Administration, Shanxi Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Taiyuan 030006, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xing-Ai", "Initials": "XA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471906", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202303009"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
