Participants, wearing painter coveralls and masks, spread 30 mL of tempera paint over their hands and washed for 20 s with neutral soap. Each participant repeated this five times sequentially, and cumulative results were recorded. Escherichia coli was exposed to ozonated water from the sink unit and to regular tap water and evaluated for microbial survival.", "Compared with a conventional sink, the SmartFLO3 sink had less environmental contamination within the sink, surrounding area and splashback on to the participant. Despite modifications to enhance ozone generation, readings of reactive oxygen species did not exceed 0.3 ppm, and no significant bactericidal effect was demonstrated.", "The SmartFLO3 sink reduces splashback and has the potential to reduce pathogen transmission from sinks. At the low levels of ozone generated in this study, no clear bacterial killing effect was observed compared with tap water alone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Healthcare Infection Society.
