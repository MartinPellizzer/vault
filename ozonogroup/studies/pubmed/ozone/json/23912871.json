The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of a commercially available ozonated oil (O3-Oil), in comparison with 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and 10% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) through a disk diffusion test. For each antiseptic a series of two-fold dilutions was made, obtaining seven dilutions: 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64 and 1:128. The undiluted antiseptics and the seven dilutions were tested against two freeze-dried bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). O3-Oil showed significantly greater diameters of growth inhibition (p<0.01) than CHX and PVP-I in all dilutions for both tested strains. CHX lost any antibacterial efficacy when diluted more than 1:32. At the highest dilution, the diameters of growth inhibition against Sa were 20.67\u00b10.58 mm and 15.33\u00b10.58 mm, for O3-Oil and PVP-I, respectively. At the same dilution, the diameters of growth inhibition against Pg were: 19.00 mm for O3-Oil and 13.67\u00b10.58 mm for PVP-I. The promising results obtained for the O3-Oil, against the opportunistic Sa, and Pg, one of the main periodontal pathogens, suggest its potential applicability for periodontal treatment. Further preclinical and clinical investigations are warranted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology and Implantology, School of Dentistry, Alma Mater Studiorum."}], "LastName": "Montevecchi", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dorigo", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cricca", "ForeName": "Monica", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Checchi", "ForeName": "Luigi", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "New Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9516291", "ISSNLinking": "1121-7138"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "85H0HZU99M", "NameOfSubstance": "Povidone-Iodine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MOR84MUD8E", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorhexidine gluconate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Porphyromonas gingivalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Povidone-Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23912871"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
