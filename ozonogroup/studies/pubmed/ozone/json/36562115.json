This study investigates the effectiveness of gaseous ozone treatment in the control of microbiological and mite growth without negatively affecting product quality.", "Cheese samples were treated with gaseous ozone at 200 and 300\u2009ppb for 8\u00a0h per day (overnight) for 150\u2009days in storage rooms under controlled conditions (12\u2009\u00b0C and 85% relative humidity). The results showed that ozone at 200\u2009ppb limits the growth of mites starting from 25\u2009days of storage and significantly reduced bacteria, molds, and yeasts counts starting from 75\u2009days of storage. Concerning the physicochemical and qualitative parameters evaluated during ripening (weight loss, moisture content, dry weight, ash, fat, protein, total nitrogen, color, non-destructive firmness), no significant differences were shown between the control samples and ozone treatment at 200\u2009ppb. Sensory analysis (consumer test) also showed no specific defects with the ozone-treated samples. It was observed that the ozone treatment at 300\u2009ppb had limited microbiological growth and no alteration of sensory aspects but did not have the same positive impact on some aspects of overall quality, compared with ozone treatment at 200\u2009ppb.", "The use of gaseous ozone treatments during ripening of pecorino cheese can potentially offer an excellent solution for the control of mite growth, while preserving the quality and sensory characteristics of the product. For this reason, this technique could be very useful for commercial purposes. \u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Grasso", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Eramo", "ForeName": "Vanessa", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Lembo", "ForeName": "Micaela", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Forniti", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrie De Nora Spa, Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Carboni", "ForeName": "Cristian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1866-8741"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Botondi", "ForeName": "Rinaldo", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Production regulations of the Denomination of Origin of the \u201cCanestrato Pugliese\u201d cheese, DPR 9 October 1985 - GURI n. 112,16/05/1986. https://www.onaf.it/uploads/public/formaggi/1461_1-dop-canestrato-pugliese-disciplinare-iniziale.pdf"}, {"Citation": "Hughes AM, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Technical Bulletin, 9, in The Mites of Stored Food and Houses.
