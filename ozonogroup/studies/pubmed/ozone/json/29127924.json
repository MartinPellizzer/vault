The results show that the PMS+O<sub>3</sub> is more effective than other mentioned procedures. Therefore, under optimized conditions (pH\u00a0=\u00a011, PMS/O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.06 and Dose O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a012.5\u00a0mmol), VS (Volatile solids) and fecal coliforms reduced respectively 42% and 89% after 60\u00a0min and the stabilized sludge in term of pathogen reduction requirements was class B. Furthermore, time to filter (TTF) of sludge decreased 70% relative to the raw sludge. In order to demonstrate the dewatering conditions' improvement, the variations of particle size distribution, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and zeta potential were evaluated. Overall, the results show that the PMS+O<sub>3</sub> has the capability of stabilizing and dewatering the sludge simultaneously."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
