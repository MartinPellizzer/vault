Ozone (O3) produced by both models meets U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) suggested prediction criteria of mean normalized bias error and mean normalized gross error on January 14 but none on January 13. Both models are tested with various modified databases of precursors emissions from the PCD original database. Performance of UAM-V is the best when using the modified emission data with volatile organic compound (VOC), NOx, and CO mobile source emission reduced by 50%, 50%, and 20% from the original database. CHIMERE suggests a similar emission database except for the VOC emission, which is a reduction by 40% from the original PCD mobile source emission.
