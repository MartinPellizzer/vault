Due to their high reactivity towards ozone (1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(5)-2.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(6)\u00a0M(-1)\u00a0s(-1)) the investigated aniline bearing different substituents are readily degraded in ozonation. However, around 4 to 5 molecules of ozone are needed to yield a successful transformation of aniline, most likely due to a chain reaction that decomposes ozone without compound degradation. This is inferred from OH radical scavenging experiments, in which compound transformation per ozone consumed is increased. Mechanistic considerations based on product formation indicate that addition to the aromatic ring is the preferential reaction in the case of aniline, p-chloroaniline and p-nitroaniline (high amounts of o-hydroxyaniline, p-hydroxyaniline, chloride, nitrite and nitrate, respectively were found). For aniline an addition to the nitrogen happens but to a small extent, since nitroso- and nitrobenzene were observed as well. In the case of N-methylaniline and N,N-dimethylaniline, an electron transfer reaction from nitrogen to ozone was proven due to the formation of formaldehyde. In contrast, for p-methylaniline and p-methoxyaniline the formation of formaldehyde may result from an electron transfer reaction at the aromatic ring. Additional oxidation pathways for all of the anilines under study are reactions of hydroxyl radicals formed in the electron transfer of ozone with the anilines (OH radical yields\u00a0=\u00a034-59%). These reactions may form aminyl radicals which in the case of aniline can terminate in bimolecular reactions with other compounds such as the determined o-hydroxyaniline by yielding the detected 2-amino-5-anilino-benzochinon-anil."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
