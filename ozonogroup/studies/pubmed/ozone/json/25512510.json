We evaluate the air quality-related human health impacts of 10 such options, including the use of liquid biofuels, diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) in internal combustion engines; the use of electricity from a range of conventional and renewable sources to power electric vehicles (EVs); and the use of hybrid EV technology. Our approach combines spatially, temporally, and chemically detailed life cycle emission inventories; comprehensive, fine-scale state-of-the-science chemical transport modeling; and exposure, concentration-response, and economic health impact modeling for ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We find that powering vehicles with corn ethanol or with coal-based or \"grid average\" electricity increases monetized environmental health impacts by 80% or more relative to using conventional gasoline. Conversely, EVs powered by low-emitting electricity from natural gas, wind, water, or solar power reduce environmental health impacts by 50% or more. Consideration of potential climate change impacts alongside the human health outcomes described here further reinforces the environmental preferability of EVs powered by low-emitting electricity relative to gasoline vehicles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8864-7436"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; and."}], "LastName": "Tessum", "ForeName": "Christopher W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108 hill0408@umn.edu julian@umn.edu."}], "LastName": "Hill", "ForeName": "Jason D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; and hill0408@umn.edu julian@umn.edu."}], "LastName": "Marshall", "ForeName": "Julian D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biofuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Jul 28;112(30):E3974. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1510395112", "PMID": "26199421"}, {"RefSource": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Jul 28;112(30):E3973. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1508685112", "PMID": "26221008"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Renewable Energy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": " Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Geneva).
