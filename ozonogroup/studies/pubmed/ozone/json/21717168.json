Low and medium molecular weight lignin break-down products are known to have harmful effects on the environment. According to some recent results, also high molecular weight (HMW) material consisting mainly of lignin and carbohydrates may cause toxic effects to the environment. For these reasons, toxicity and structure studies of HMW materials are of great importance. This investigation is a part of a larger project to obtain more structure information of HMW materials and toxicity of ECF and TCF bleaching effluents. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been commonly used for the characterization of organic macromolecules such as lignin, but to our knowledge, no reports have appeared dealing with the comparison of SEC of ECF and TCF bleaching liquors. The aim of the present study was to get more information about the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of HMW fractions of waste liquors from ECF and TCF bleaching sequences by SEC.", "The MWDs of organic materials dissolved during different stages of ECF bleaching (O-D-EOP-D-ED) and TCF bleaching (O-Z-Q-P-Z-Q-P-P) of softwood (Pinus sylvestris) kraft pulp were determined and compared by SEC. All effluent samples from the above bleaching stages were ultrafiltrated using a membrane with a cutoff value of 1,000\u00a0Da. SEC was performed on high and also low molecular weight fractions and non-fractionated effluents. In the SEC experiments, a Superdex 75 column was used with 0.1\u00a0M NaOH solution as the eluent. Standards used for calibrating the SEC system were albumin, carboanhydrase, cytochrome C, tannic acid, dehydrodiacetovanillone, and vanillin.", "The chromatograms of liquors from TCF bleaching stages vary more than those from ECF bleaching. Peroxide and chelating stages contained mostly high molecular weight (HMW) matter whereas chlorine dioxide and ozone stages had more low molecular weight compounds. The lignin content in HMW matter was higher than in stages that consisted of low molecular matter. Bleaching effluents contained the highest amounts of HMW material, mainly lignin, in the beginning of the sequences; the amounts decreased towards the end of the bleaching sequence.", "Determinations of MWD by the SEC method showed that effluents from the TCF sequence contained more HMW material than those from the ECF stage. This might be due to peroxide stages (P) that dissolve HMW lignin effectively. However, the molecular weights of ozone stages (Z) were very low compared to other stages. Chlorine dioxide stages also dissolved mostly low molecular weight lignin. Ultrafiltration of bleaching liquors showed that high molecular weight fraction also included some low molecular weight compounds and vice versa. High polydispersity and high lignin content correlated with the amount of HMW material in ECF and TCF bleaching stages.", "Our liquor samples were studied by using a UV detector commonly used for lignin preparations; in upcoming investigations, it will be interesting to determine carbohydrates such as hemicelluloses. The results are applicable in papermaking in order to improve commonly used bleaching procedures, to test new potential bleaching systems, and to study chemical behavior of HMW materials in various bleaching liquors. The present results also form a good basis for toxicity measurements of ECF and TCF bleaching effluents and for more comprehensive spectroscopic and chromatographic experiments with samples taken from various bleaching stages. From the behavior of liquors studied, it appears that our other structure investigations by spectroscopic and chromatographic (NMR, Py-GC/MS, etc.) methods mostly correlate well with the present results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kukkola", "ForeName": "Jukka", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knuutinen", "ForeName": "Juha", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paasivirta", "ForeName": "Jaakko", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herve", "ForeName": "Sirpa", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pessala", "ForeName": "Piia", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schultz", "ForeName": "Eija", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8068-05-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Kraft lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf. 2003 Jan;54(1):74-86", "ArticleIdList": ["12547638"]}, {"Citation": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf. 2010 Oct;73(7):1641-5", "ArticleIdList": ["20494440"]}, {"Citation": "Bioresour Technol. 2001 Apr;77(2):183-91", "ArticleIdList": ["11272026"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2009 Jun;75(11):1506-11", "ArticleIdList": ["19344930"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2005 Nov;12(6):375-80", "ArticleIdList": ["16305144"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21717168", "10.1007/s11356-011-0556-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
