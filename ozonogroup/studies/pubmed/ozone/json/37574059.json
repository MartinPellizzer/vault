As maritime transportation continues to expand, the effect of ship emissions on air quality is becoming increasingly important. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF), the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ), and the integrated process rate (IPR) module provided in the CMAQ are applied to evaluate the impacts of ship emissions on O<sub>3</sub> concentration at a national scale in China, including the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing pathways. Ship emissions can increase or decrease O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, with varying effects in different seasons and regions. In the winter, spring, and fall, ship emissions were predicted to decrease O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in most areas, whereas in the summer, they increase the O<sub>3</sub> concentration, even in regions far away from the coastline, thus adversely affecting the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (YRD). Additionally, owing to differences in the emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, the northern and southern regions of the YRD respond differently to ship emissions. Additionally, the influence of ship emissions on the diurnal variation of O<sub>3</sub> in the summer was investigated, where significant differences were indicated between cities. The IPR was used to investigate the individual processes contributing to changes in the O<sub>3</sub> concentration caused by ship emissions. The transport process appears to be the primary contributor to O<sub>3</sub> production, whereas chemistry and dry deposition played key roles in O<sub>3</sub> loss. This study provides an in-depth insight into the impacts of ship emissions on O<sub>3</sub> in China, which can facilitate the formulation of corresponding environmental policies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
