Then it was placed in the Lowenstein-Jensen media containing various concentrations of S, I, R, and K. Following 3 months, drug susceptibility was determined by the number of cultured colonies and MBT was used to prepare a suspension at the same concentration, which was again treated with pO3 by the same procedure and placed to the media containing the drugs. A session was thrice repeated. After each pO3 treatment, MBT resistance to I decreased and it completely disappeared after triple treatment. Each pO3 treatment caused a reduction in MBT resistance to R, but it was high (640 microg/ml). After double pO3 treatment MBT resistance to S decreased, but it was recovered after its third ozone treatment. All pO3-untreated control cultures showed a growth of more than 100 colonies. Sixty-eight BALC/s mice were in vivo inoculated via intravenous injections of the clinical MBT strain resistant to S, I, R, and K. The mice were divided into 5 groups: 1) intact mice; 2) those inoculated and untreated; 3) those treated with 1; 4) those treated with I and peritoneally given pO3, 0.5-4 microg/ml); and 5) those given pO3. The animals began dying at month 4 of inoculation. By month 5, all mice, other than intact and pO3-treated ones, died. Passage of MBT from the month by month 4 showed a reduction in their resistance to I in the groups treated with pO3. When the mice were treated with I alone, damages to their livers and spleens were greater than when they were untreated. With co-administration of I and pO3, the damage was least. Treatment provoked a rapid change of MBT to granular and L-forms and MBT was undetectable in its typical form after 1-2-month therapy. The altered MBT formed an untypical histological pattern of tuberculous inflammation in mice in the presence of characteristic cellular cooperation. Clinical studies indicated that 1-6-month concurrent use of chemotherapy and pO3 in patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis eliminated drug resistance of isolated MBT to one of the drugs (I, R, K) in 97.3%, MBT became at once susceptible to I, R, and K in 47.2%. I and/or R were successfully used in the treatment of more than a third of the patients. The studies have demonstrated that most patients with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis can be treated with the most effective drugs provided that systemic intravenous injection of pO3 is made."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belianin", "ForeName": "I I", "Initials": "II"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shmelev", "ForeName": "E I", "Initials": "EI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Probl Tuberk Bolezn Legk", "NlmUniqueID": "101211108", "ISSNLinking": "1728-2993"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibiotics, Antitubercular"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "59-01-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Kanamycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V83O1VOZ8L", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoniazid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VJT6J7R4TR", "NameOfSubstance": "Rifampin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y45QSO73OB", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptomycin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antibiotics, Antitubercular"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Isoniazid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Kanamycin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiography, Thoracic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Rifampin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Streptomycin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17419333"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
