Ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is a powerful technique for retrieving the profiles of tropospheric trace gases, such as NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and HCHO. However, since the difficulties in deducting the effects of stratospheric ozone, there are few studies on the retrieval of tropospheric ozone profiles using MAX-DOAS measurements. Here, we developed an accurate inversion method to retrieve tropospheric ozone concentrations during the PRIDE-GBA Campaign, wherein the ozone differential slant column densities (DSCDs) were retrieved in QDOAS software using the \"time-interpolated zenith spectrum\" as the reference spectrum. The tropospheric DSCDs (DSCDs<sub>trop</sub>) were then calculated by subtracting the simulated stratospheric DSCDs (DSCDs<sub>str</sub>, simulated from the SCIATRAN model) from the DSCDs. Tropospheric ozone profiles were retrieved from the DSCDs<sub>trop</sub> using the optimal estimation method (OEM). The results showed that high values of tropospheric ozone were mainly distributed below 1 km, which is consistent with lidar measurements. In addition, the observed surface ozone concentrations were highly correlated with the in-situ measurements, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.75 and 0.81, respectively. Combined with the retrieved NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO profiles using the MAX-DOAS measurements, we found that the planetary boundary layer ozone pollution of HeShan Observatory during the PRIDE-GBA Campaign are controlled by the NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime. The results of this study indicate that the MAX-DOAS technique has the potential to retrieve tropospheric ozone profiles with high temporal and spatial resolution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
