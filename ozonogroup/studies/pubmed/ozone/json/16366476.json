It was found that O3/H2O2 possessed more favorable inactivation effect on Cyclops compared with the others, in distilled water with 1.0 mg/L of O3 and 4 mg/L of H2O2 the inactivation effect was 100% after 30 min contacting; ozone also had favorable inactivation effect, the inactivation effect is 80% by 1.0 mg/L of ozone alone; while hydrogen peroxide didn't, there was almost no inactivation effect by 4 mg/L of H2O2. The best inactivation condition for O3/H2O2 processes, that was, two oxidants were added sequentially with interval in range of 30 to 60 seconds, for them ozone at first. And the influencing factors under various conditions such as the dose of hydrogen peroxide, organic substance content, pH value, etc. were researched and reported. It was found that the effect didn't changed largely with H2O2 on the range of 4 mg/L to 10 mg/L, and inactivation effects on Cyclops of O3/H2O2 were not sensitive to pH value, while it declined obviously as the organic content increased. Finally, synergic removal effect on Cyclops with O3/H2O2 preoxidation followed by clarification process was investigated. The results show that the removal effect on Cyclops is further strengthened by clarification processes after O3/H2O2 pre-oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal & Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Fu-Yi", "Initials": "FY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ya-Qin", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dong-Mei", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Zooplankton"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16366476"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
