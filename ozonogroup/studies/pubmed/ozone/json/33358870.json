Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to evaluate the long-term environmental effects of applied strategies and technologies on cattle slurry management for mitigation of environmental harmful gases. This study was carried on two main aims: first, the effect of the addition of sulphuric acid (SA), biochar (SBi) or A\u00a0+\u00a0Bi to liquid cattle-slurry (treated systems) on gas emissions during storage compared to the untreated system (S) was investigated in a laboratory-controlled experiment; second, the environmental implications of each treated or untreated system were assessed through a LCA approach according to ISO 14040/44. Five CML 2001 impact categories were used: eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), global warming potential (GWP), human toxicity potential (HTP) and Ozone Layer Depletion Potential (ODP). Comparisons were based on 1 ton fresh dairy cattle slurry. The environmental profile of untreated system showed lower efficiency in mitigation of total GHG and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions (0.0312 and 0.0001\u00a0kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq respectively), during storage period and greater impact on GWP and HTP categories. The electricity consumption in mechanical separation dominated the environmental impacts. From the three proposed treated systems, SA showed the highest efficiency on mitigation of gas emissions compared to the other treatments, reducing NH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions respectively in 61%, 98% and 15%, when compared to the SBi system. In all categories, acidified slurry also showed the lowest environmental impact relative to other treated systems and the benefit was more evident when the impacts were expressed per kilogram of nitrogen in the slurry. Therefore, LCA methodology was of great importance to assess the environmental implications of the treatments and acidification can be considered as an effective technique on the mitigation of environmental implications of livestock production and cattle-effluent valorization. Optimization and uniformity of performed studies are essential to validate new strategies to improve the sustainability of this sector in the management of animal wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
