Consequently, a single sensor's response to O<sub>3</sub> is indistinguishable from its response to NO<sub>2</sub>. Recently, a method for quantifying O<sub>3</sub> concentrations became commercially available (Alphasense Ltd., Essex, UK): collocating a pair of sensors, a typical oxidative gas sensor that responds to both O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> (model OX-B431) and a second similar sensor that filters O<sub>3</sub> and responds only to NO<sub>2</sub> (model NO2-B43F). By pairing the two sensors, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations can be calculated. We calibrated samples of three NO2-B43F sensors and three OX-B431 sensors with NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exclusively and conducted mixture experiments over a range of 0-1.0\u2009ppm NO<sub>2</sub> and 0-125\u2009ppb O<sub>3</sub> to evaluate the ability of the paired sensors to quantify NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in mixture. Although the slopes of the response among our samples of three sensors of each type varied by as much as 37%, the individual response of the NO2-B43F sensors to NO<sub>2</sub> and OX-B431 sensors to NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were highly linear over the concentrations studied (R<sup>2</sup> \u2265 0.99). The NO2-B43F sensors responded minimally to O<sub>3</sub> gas with statistically non-significant slopes of response. In mixtures of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, quantification of NO<sub>2</sub> was generally accurate with overestimates up to 29%, compared to O<sub>3</sub>, which was generally underestimated by as much as 187%. We observed changes in sensor baseline over 4 days of experiments equivalent to 34\u2009ppb O<sub>3</sub>, prompting an alternate method of calculating concentrations by baseline-correcting sensor signal. The baseline-correction method resulted in underestimates of NO<sub>2</sub> up to 44% and decreases in the underestimation of O<sub>3</sub> up to 107% for O<sub>3</sub>. Both methods for calculating gas concentrations progressively underestimated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations as the ratio of NO<sub>2</sub> signal to O<sub>3</sub> signal increased. Our results suggest that paired NO2-B43F and OX-B431 sensors permit quantification of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in mixture, but that O<sub>3</sub> concentration estimates are less accurate and precise than those for NO<sub>2</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health and Engineering , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2233-2706"], "LastName": "Zuidema", "ForeName": "Christopher", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health and Engineering , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6337-1824"], "LastName": "Afshar-Mohajer", "ForeName": "Nima", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tatum", "ForeName": "Marcus", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5032-4001"], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Geb", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Occupational and Environmental Health , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1698-8856"], "LastName": "Peters", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health and Engineering , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0516-6945"], "LastName": "Koehler", "ForeName": "Kirsten", "Initials": "K"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 OH010533", "Acronym": "OH", "Agency": "NIOSH CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01OH010533", "Acronym": "ACL", "Agency": "ACL HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T42OH008428", "Acronym": "ACL", "Agency": "ACL HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Occup Environ Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "101189458", "ISSNLinking": "1545-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Kumar P, Morawska L, Martani C, et al.: The rise of low-cost sensing for managing air pollution in cities.
