In this study, metal doped Cu<sub>2</sub>O catalysts are synthesized via reduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup> by ascorbic acid in base solutions containing doping metal ions. The results show that compared with pure Cu<sub>2</sub>O, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> dopants enhance the O<sub>3</sub> removal efficiency while Ni<sup>2+</sup> depresses the activity. In specific, Mg-Cu<sub>2</sub>O shows high O<sub>3</sub> removal efficiency of 88.4% in harsh environment of 600,000\u00a0mL/(g\u00b7hr) space velocity and 1500\u00a0ppmV O<sub>3</sub>, which is one of the highest in the literature. Photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic spectroscopy characterization shows higher concentration of crystal defects induced by the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dopants, favoring the O<sub>3</sub> degradation. The in-situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows the intermediate species in the O<sub>3</sub> degradation process change from O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> dominant of pure Cu<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> dominant of Mg-Cu<sub>2</sub>O, which would contribute to the high activity. All these results show the promising prospect of the Mg-Cu<sub>2</sub>O for highly efficiency O<sub>3</sub> removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
