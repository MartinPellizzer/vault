Results show that: (1) Vertical profiles of monthly average O3 concentration were in good agreement, with increasing altitude, the concentrations were first increased and then decreased, and then remained almost constant, and there was a clear dividing line at 1.5 km altitude, the vertical gradient of the O3 concentration changed greatly below which, there were O3 high-value areas, which were influenced by human activities near the ground; the change of vertical gradient of O3 concentration was significantly reduced above 1.5 km altitude, this space was above the mixing layer, where the air mass movement was less affected by underlying surface, and the advection-diffusion played a crucial role in the local accumulation process of air pollutants. (2) Changes of O3 concentration showed clear seasonal characteristics, O3 concentration was lower in spring and autumn, but higher in summer. In the months studied, no significant difference in monthly average O3 concentration from July to September was detected (P > 0.05), but there was significant difference in other months (P < 0.01). (3) In summer days (daytime), the variations in the vertical profiles of hourly O3 concentration were consistent with those of the monthly O3 concentration. The O3 concentration was lower near the surface within 1.5 km in the morning (09:00-10:00), and higher in the afternoon (15:00-16:00), with the maximum discrepancy of about 60 x 10(-9) in the same altitude; there was minor difference in O3 concentration in altitude range of 1.5-3.5 km, generally fluctuating among 70 x 10(-9) -80 x 10(-9). (4) For the regional distribution of O3 concentration, higher concentration within 0-2 km appeared near the Fourth Ring Road of city center and the surrounding areas, the main reasons for this distribution might be the presence of many strong sources of pollution emissions and low sink flow near the ground; within 2-4 km, in addition to the urban area of Beijing, higher O3 concentration areas were found in the north, the south-east (Beijing-Tianjin direction), the south-west (Beijing-Baoding direction). (5) There were significant correlation between O3 and NO, NO2 and NO2/NO within 0-3.5 km, O3 was negatively related with both NO and NO2, but positively correlated with the NO2/NO ratio."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Weather Modification Office, Beijing 100089, China. yueyueniaofei@163.com"}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Peng-Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Quan", "ForeName": "Jian-Nong", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Meng-Yu", "Initials": "MY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spatio-Temporal Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23379135"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
