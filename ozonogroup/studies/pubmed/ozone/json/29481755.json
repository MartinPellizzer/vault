Recent studies have demonstrated that the uptake of ozone by aqueous bromide solution is promoted by reactions at the gas-liquid interface. The present work investigated the heterogeneous reaction between gaseous ozone and aqueous bromide solution at atmospheric pressure and room temperature using a wetted wall flow reactor combined with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The emission rate of Br<sub>2</sub> was measured as a function of gaseous ozone concentration, aqueous bromide concentration, and pH. In addition, we conducted a simple kinetics model simulation that included only bulk aqueous-phase reactions and compared the theoretical values with the experimentally determined values. The Br<sub>2</sub> emission rates measured experimentally differ from the simulated rates at relatively high bromide concentration, as well as in the pH region of 6-9. These differences might be explained by different Br<sup>-</sup> concentration and/or deprotonation efficiency near the interface region and those in the bulk solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9863-4241"], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Yosuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goda", "ForeName": "Motoki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1647-4799"], "LastName": "Hirokawa", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29481755", "10.1021/acs.jpca.7b12819"]}}]}
