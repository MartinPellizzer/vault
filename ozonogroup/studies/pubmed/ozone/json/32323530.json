Based on the reasonable optimization of electrical and optical characteristics in the device, the maximum power conversion efficiency with the use of polymer F-1DPCs can be greatly improved by 24-27% compared to the respective control devices. The improvement in <i>J</i><sub>SC</sub> is comprehensively discussed, which is mainly ascribed to the enhancement of effective photon absorption in the device. Although color tunability of fullerene and nonfullerene all-flexible STPSCs can be easily achieved with the use of different photonic band gaps of polymer F-1DPCs, the CIE coordinates of nonfullerene STPSCs differ a lot from the original light source compared to the fullerene ones because of a high absorption coefficient in a narrow wavelength region. This work presents an easy and effective microcavity device strategy incorporated with different elements and demonstrates a new sketch of structure-absorption-performance relationships for fullerene- versus nonfullerene-based all-flexible STPSCs, which is compatible with low-cost roll-to-roll manufacturing and surely has a diversity of potential applications to better meet specific needs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Siyuan Laboratory, Department of Physics, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Wenhao", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Siyuan Laboratory, Department of Physics, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, PR China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Xuhao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Siyuan Laboratory, Department of Physics, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yangdong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials & Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials & Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510640, PR China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Canbin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7158-1808"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials & Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials & Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510640, PR China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Anjun", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials & Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials & Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510640, PR China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4358-3862"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Vacuum Coating Technologies and New Energy Materials, Siyuan Laboratory, Department of Physics, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, PR China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Lintao", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32323530", "10.1021/acsami.0c03508"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
