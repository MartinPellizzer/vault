Due to their moderately long lifetimes, O<sub>3</sub> and PM can be transported over long distances, cross the boundaries of source regions and contribute to air pollution in other regions. The reported contributions of cross-regional transport (CRT) to O<sub>3</sub> and fine PM (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations often exceed those of local emissions in the major regions of China, highlighting the important role of CRT in regional air pollution. Therefore, further improvement of air quality in China requires more joint efforts among regions to ensure a proper reduction in emissions while accounting for the influence of CRT. This review summarizes the methodologies employed to assess the influence of CRT on O<sub>3</sub> and PM pollution as well as current knowledge of CRT influence in China. Quantifying CRT contributions in proportion to O<sub>3</sub> and PM levels and studying detailed CRT processes of O<sub>3</sub>, PM and precursors can be both based on targeted observations and/or model simulations. Reported publications indicate that CRT contributes by 40-80\u00a0% to O<sub>3</sub> and by 10-70\u00a0% to PM<sub>2.5</sub> in various regions of China. These contributions exhibit notable spatiotemporal variations, with differences in meteorological conditions and/or emissions often serving as main drivers of such variations. Based on trajectory-based methods, transport pathways contributing to O<sub>3</sub> and PM pollution in major regions of China have been revealed. Recent studies also highlighted the important role of horizontal transport in the middle/high atmospheric boundary layer or low free troposphere, of vertical exchange and mixing as well as of interactions between CRT, local meteorology and chemistry in the detailed CRT processes. Drawing on the current knowledge on the influence of CRT, this paper provides recommendations for future studies that aim at supporting ongoing air pollution mitigation strategies in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
