Increase in green house gas in the atmosphere was regarded as an important cause. Atmospheric composition had significantly changed due to intensive technogenic pollution. Increase in aerosol (solid, liquid and gas) concentration had serious impact on human health and raised the level of risk factors for longevity of life. Despite, global character of climatic change and its intensity in numerous ways was influenced by local specificity of regions, their geographical location and meteorological factors. A study on the atmospheric quality (quantitative and percentage estimation of aerosols) of Georgia was carried out. Also the assessment of impact of meteorological and ecological conditions on human health was made for Tbilisi city. A relation between contaminants and meteorological factors was evaluated, particularly gas pollutants were strongly correlated with each other due to their photochemical activity; positive correlation (0.65; 0.69) between air temperature and pollutants. All the contaminants showed negative correlation with relative humidity, due to hydrolyzing ability. On the basis of multi-factorial statistical analysis, correlation between ambulance call, weather type, atmosphere pollution index, change in ground ozone quantity and earth magnetic field were determined. Atmospheric pollution due to dust, carbon, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ground ozone quantity in Tbilisi significantly exceeded maximum permissible level, that effected human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lagidze", "ForeName": "Lamzira", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matchavariani", "ForeName": "Lia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsivtsivadze", "ForeName": "Nodar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khidasheli", "ForeName": "Nargiz", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Paichadze", "ForeName": "Nino", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Motsonelidze", "ForeName": "Nargiz", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vakhtangishvili", "ForeName": "Maia", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8300544", "ISSNLinking": "0254-8704"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Georgia (Republic)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26591888"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
