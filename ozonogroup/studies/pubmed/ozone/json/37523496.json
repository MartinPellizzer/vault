Despite extensive studies on their chemical and physical properties, the ground- and excited-state chemistry of their atmospheric oxidation products is less well understood. This study focuses on the ground- and excited-state chemistry of the simplest fluorinated Criegee intermediate (CI), fluoroformaldehyde oxide (HFCOO), which is the simplest fluorinated CI formed from the ozonolysis of HFOs. HFCOO contains syn- and anti-conformers, which have Boltzmann populations of, respectively, 87 and 13% at 298 K. For both conformers, the calculated ground-state reaction energy profiles associated with cyclization to form fluorodioxirane is lower than the equivalent unimolecular decay path in the simplest CI, H<sub>2</sub>COO, with anti-HFCOO returning a barrier height more than half of that of H<sub>2</sub>COO. The excited-state dynamics reveal that photoexcitation to the bright S<sub>2</sub> state of syn-HFCOO and anti-HFCOO is expected to undergo a prompt O-O fission\u2500with the former conformer expected to dissociate with an almost unity quantum yield and to form both O (<sup>1</sup>D) + HFCO (S<sub>0</sub>) and O (<sup>3</sup>P) + HFCO (T<sub>1</sub>) products. In contrast, photoexcitation of anti-HFCOO is expected to undergo an O-O bond fission with a non-unity quantum yield. The fraction of photoexcited anti-HFCOO that dissociates is predicted to exclusively form O (<sup>1</sup>D) + HFCO (S<sub>0</sub>) products, which is in sharp contrast to H<sub>2</sub>COO. The wider implications of our results are discussed from both physical and atmospheric chemistry perspectives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, Louisiana 70504, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Application Center, NASA/University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, Louisiana 70506, United States."}], "LastName": "Poirier", "ForeName": "Courtney A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, Louisiana 70504, United States."}], "LastName": "Guidry", "ForeName": "Lily M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, Louisiana 70504, United States."}], "LastName": "Ratliff", "ForeName": "Jordyn M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6035-3869"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California 94035-1000, United States."}], "LastName": "Esposito", "ForeName": "Vincent J", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0661-9029"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, Louisiana 70504, United States."}], "LastName": "Marchetti", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0583-3824"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, Louisiana 70504, United States."}], "LastName": "Karsili", "ForeName": "Tolga N V", "Initials": "TNV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37523496", "10.1021/acs.jpca.3c01530"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
