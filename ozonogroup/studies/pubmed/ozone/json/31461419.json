To solve this problem, the O<sub>3</sub>/Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> system was put forward, and p-nitrophenol (PNP) was chosen to explore the mechanism of this system. The effects of key operational parameters were studied respectively; the Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> dosage 3 g/L, ozone inlet flow rate 3.5 L/min, ozone concentration 65 mg/L, reactor pressure 0.25 MPa, and temperature 25 \u00b0C were obtained as the optimal operating conditions. After 60 min treatment, the organic matter mineralized completely, which was higher than the sum of the ozonation-alone process (55.63%) and the Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> process (3.53%). It suggests that the calcium hydroxide in the O<sub>3</sub>/Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> process possessed a paramount role in the removal of PNP. The liquid samples and the precipitated substances were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; it was demonstrated that Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> could accelerate the generation of hydroxyl radical and simultaneously in situ separate partial intermediate products and CO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2-</sup> ions through some precipitation reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing 400054, China E-mail: hengjunq@cqut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, Chongqing College of Electronic Engineering, Chongqing 401331, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing 400054, China E-mail: hengjunq@cqut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quan", "ForeName": "Xuejun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing 400054, China E-mail: hengjunq@cqut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing 400054, China E-mail: hengjunq@cqut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiaoxue", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing 400054, China E-mail: hengjunq@cqut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Zhiliang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Municipal Solid Waste Resource Utilization & Treatment Collaborative Innovation Center, Chongqing 401331, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y92ZL45L4R", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbubbles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31461419", "10.2166/wst.2019.227"]}}]}
