The pulsed corona discharge in contact with liquid, operated in oxygen, produced 3.5mgL<sup>-1</sup> ozone, which was subsequently introduced in the ozonation reactor. The solution to be treated was continuously circulated between the plasma reactor and the ozonation reactor. The system was tested for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and considerably improved performance as compared to ozonation alone, both with respect to the removal of the target compound and to mineralization. The apparent reaction rate constant for 2,4-D removal was 0.195min<sup>-1</sup>, more than two times higher than the value obtained in ozonation experiments. The mineralization reached more than 90% after 60min treatment and the chlorine balance confirms the absence of quantifiable amounts of chlorinated by-products. The energy efficiency was considerably enhanced by shortening the duration of the discharge pulses, which opens the way for further optimization of the electrical circuit design."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
