Populations that evolved under UV stress were about 3-fold more resistant than the ancestral and non-UV-evolved populations. UV-evolved cells were 7-fold more resistant to ionizing radiation than their non-UV-exposed evolved relatives and ancestor. In addition to the acquired increased UV resistance, further changes in microbial stress response to hydrogen peroxide, increased salinity, and desiccation were observed in UV-evolved cells. This indicates that UV-sensitive ancestral cells are capable of adapting to periodically applied UV stress via the evolution of cells with an increased UV resistance level and further enhanced responses to other environmental stressors, which thereby allows them to survive and reproduce under extreme UV radiation as a selection pressure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Radiation Biology Department, Research Group Astrobiology, Cologne, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wassmann", "ForeName": "Marko", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moeller", "ForeName": "Ralf", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reitz", "ForeName": "G\u00fcnther", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rettberg", "ForeName": "Petra", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Astrobiology", "NlmUniqueID": "101088083", "ISSNLinking": "1557-8070"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evolution, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmolar Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20735251", "10.1089/ast.2009.0455"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
