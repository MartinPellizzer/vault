Conventional mechanical debridement often needs adjunctive measures to control the disease process. The objective of the present study was to find out benefit of ozonized water irrigation along with nonsurgical periodontal therapy for the management of periodontitis.", "We have conducted a randomized controlled, triple-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial. The test group (n\u00a0=\u00a025) was treated with ozonized water irrigation, whereas the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a025) received normal saline irrigation along with mechanical debridement. Full mouth plaque score, bleeding score, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss were evaluated at baseline and 4\u00a0weeks after treatment. Salivary interleukin 1 beta was analysed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Analysis of covariance, t test and chi-square test were used for intergroup comparison. Intragroup comparison was done using the paired t test.", "Adjunctive ozone water irrigation resulted in significant improvement in all clinical parameters, except probing pocket depth after adjusting the extraneous effects due to initial confounding factors (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). But as per subgroup analysis, ozone water irrigation resulted in significant reduction in pocket depth in deep pockets (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and the number of sites with a pocket depth \u22654\u00a0mm with bleeding on probing. Salivary interleukin 1 beta also reduced significantly in the test group after therapy.", "Ozone irrigation provides adjunctive benefit along with nonsurgical periodontal therapy in reducing clinical parameters and inflammatory mediators in saliva. But long-term benefits need to be assessed with future studies. The study was registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI no: CTRI/2020/06/026275)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
