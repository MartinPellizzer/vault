The mean total BTR and BTH concentrations were 390 and 117\u00a0ng/L in raw water, 51.2 and 66.5\u00a0ng/L in treated water, and 0.758 and 48.4\u00a0ng/L in bottled water, respectively. Different distribution patterns were observed according to the water type, with the dominant BTR being 1H-BTR (mean: 57.8%) in raw water and a predominance of BTH in bottled water (mean: 84.6%). In the DWTPs, the mean removal of BTRs (90.9%) was better than that of BTHs (29.3%). The BTRs were efficiently removed in DWTPs, and in particular during adsorption processes. 5Cl-BTR had a high removal efficiency (75.7%) in the adsorption processes, followed by 5M-BTR (70.0%), 5,6-di-MeBTR (58.4%), and 1H-BTR (50.1%). By contrast, BTHs were not efficiently removed in DWTPs, although relatively high removal efficiencies were achieved with an ozonation process (43.1%) compared to other treatment processes. In treated drinking and bottled water, the hazard quotients (HQs) of the representative BTRs and BTHs were acceptable (defined as HQ\u00a0<\u00a01), with a safety margin of 2-5 orders of magnitude."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
