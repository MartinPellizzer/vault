We aimed to assess the accuracy of BP measurements over arms with thin and thick clothing among the frail elderly.", "This is a cross-sectional study. Individuals aged 65 years or older were recruited from three long-term care facilities in Japan between April and May 2016. The main outcome measures were BP measurements (a) on a bare arm, (b) over a thin shirt, (c) over a thin shirt and a cardigan, and (d) over the sleeve of a thin shirt and a cardigan rolled up to the elbow. BP was compared across measurements using the paired t-test and multiple analysis of variance adjusting for sex and treatments for hypertension.", "Of 147 participants, 23.8% were men. The mean age of the participants was 87.2 years (SD: 7.8). The mean (SD) BP on a bare arm, over a shirt, over a shirt and a cardigan, and over a rolled-up sleeve were 128.8 (20.0)/69.3 (13.2), 131.0 (22.2)/73.9 (15.2), 136.9 (22.2)/78.9 (15.8), and 136.4 (26.0)/80.7 (15.9)\u2009mmHg, respectively. BP measurements over clothed arms were significantly higher than bare arm measurements. BP differences were significant when measured over a cardigan after adjusting for sex and treatments for hypertension.", "In the elderly, clothing has a significant effect on BP measurements. The arms should be undressed as much as possible for BP measurements in the elderly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Sachiko", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "Mikiya", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takayashiki", "ForeName": "Ayumi", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "Takuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsushita", "ForeName": "Aya", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoshimoto", "ForeName": "Hisashi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maeno", "ForeName": "Tetsuhiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Blood Press Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "9606438", "ISSNLinking": "1359-5237"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure Determination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clothing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Frail Elderly"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28926363", "10.1097/MBP.0000000000000294"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
