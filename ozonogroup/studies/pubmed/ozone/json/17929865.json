Significant amounts of pNaSS were grafted over the range of experimental conditions examined in this study (30-120 min of ozonation, reaction at 65 or 70 degrees C, and reaction times up to 240 min). Within these ranges the amount of grafted pNaSS increased with both ozonation time and reaction temperature. The amount of grafted pNaSS increased over the first 60 min of reaction, then remained relatively constant from 60 to 240 min. For the biological experiments pNaSS-grafted samples were prepared with 30 min of ozonation and 60 min of reaction at a grafting temperature of 70 degrees C. The ozonation time was limited to 30 min to minimize any possible degradation of the PET fabrics by the ozonation treatment. The pNaSS-grafted PET surface adsorbed a factor of 4 more compared to the nongrafted surfaces. The strength of fibroblast adhesion was an order of magnitude higher on pNaSS-grafted PET fabrics compared to that on nongrafted PET fabrics. This difference in the cell attachment was correlated to the cell spreading, which was better and more homogeneous on the grafted fibers compared to the nongrafted fibers. Fibroblasts adhered more strongly on surfaces precoated with normal human plasma compared to surfaces precoated with 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Biomat\u00e9riaux et Polym\u00e8res de Sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 (LBPS/B2OA-UMR 7052) Institut Galil\u00e9e, Universit\u00e9 Paris 13, 99 Avenue Jean-Baptiste Cl\u00e9ment, Villetaneuse, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pavon-Djavid", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gamble", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ciobanu", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gueguen", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castner", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Migonney", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EB 002027", "Acronym": "EB", "Agency": "NIBIB NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biomacromolecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100892849", "ISSNLinking": "1525-7797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Terephthalates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polystyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70KO0R01RY", "NameOfSubstance": "polystyrene sulfonic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Shape"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Terephthalates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polystyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17929865", "10.1021/bm070344i"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
