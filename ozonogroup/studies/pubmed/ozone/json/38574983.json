Exposures were evaluated for pre-pregnancy, each trimester, and the first two years of life. Individual and combined effects of pollutants were assessed with Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) and Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), separately for children with ASD (n\u00a0=\u00a0660) and children without ASD (typically developing (TD) and developmentally delayed (DD) combined; n\u00a0=\u00a0753) using hierarchical Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) models with three groups: PM size fractions (PM<sub>0.1</sub>, PM<sub>0.1-2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>), NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>.", "Pre-pregnancy Ozone was strongly negatively associated with all scores in the non-ASD group (group posterior inclusion probability (gPIP)\u00a0=\u00a00.83-1.00). The PM group during year 2 was also strongly negatively associated with all scores in the non-ASD group (gPIP\u00a0=\u00a00.59-0.93), with PM<sub>0.1</sub> driving the group association (conditional PIP (cPIP)\u00a0=\u00a00.73-0.96). Weaker and less consistent associations were observed between PM<sub>0.1-2.5</sub> during pre-pregnancy and ozone during year 1 and VABS scores in the ASD group.", "These findings prompt further investigation into ozone and ultrafine PM as potential environmental risk factors for neurodevelopment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
