Using the prominent nu3 ozone feature at 1043 cm(-1), we show that the strength of the spectral signature depends not only on the amount of ozone but also on the atmospheric thermal structure. This dependence can be described by a rather accurate approximation, which was used to construct a simple diagram to estimate the amount of column ozone between the instrument site and a cloud deck as well as to determine the detection limit. The detection limit is shown to depend on cloud base height. For a given thermal lapse rate it was found that the lower the detection limit, the higher the cloud base altitude. However, as shown in a case study with variable cloud base height, the concept fails for semitransparent clouds. Multiple scattering of the emitted radiation within the clouds yielded a path enhancement that simulated an enhanced amount of constituent. The path enhancement was estimated to be 2.4-4 km at 1000 cm(-1) for low-level clouds, equivalent to an enhancement factor of 6-21. The multiple scattering effect has considerable consequences for ground-based as well as for nadir satellite retrieval techniques in cloudy skies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deutscher Wetterdienst, Meteorologisches Observatorium Potsdam, Postfach 60 05 52, 14405 Potsdam, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sp\u00e4nkuch", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00f6hler", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcldner", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18273261", "10.1364/ao.37.003133", "43412"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
