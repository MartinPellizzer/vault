Most of this has come from research linking exposure to ambient particulate matter with CVD, although more recent evidence suggests that the ozone might also be contributing factor. Research on the cardiovascular toxicity of other pollutants, notably arsenic, has also grown during this period. In addition to their effects in adults, environmental agents, such as dioxin, have also been shown to adversely affect development of the heart in laboratory animals. Taken together, these results suggest that environmental exposure must be considered as an important risk factor for CVD and that further research to determine mechanisms of action and susceptible populations is needed. This research will require interdisciplinary approaches, and should yield data not only on the toxic effects of pollutants on the cardiovascular system, but on the basic pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases as well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA. mastin@niehs.nih.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mastin", "ForeName": "J Patrick", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101135818", "ISSNLinking": "1530-7905"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}], "NumberOfReferences": "24"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16046786", "10.1385/ct:5:2:091", "CT:5:2:091"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
