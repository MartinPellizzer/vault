The total mixing ratios of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> (\u03a3<sub>5</sub>RONO<sub>2</sub>) ranged from 15.4 to 143.7 pptv with an average of 65.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033.0 pptv. C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> (2-butyl nitrate and 2-propyl nitrate) were the most abundant RONO<sub>2</sub> during the entire sampling period. The mixing ratios of C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> were higher in winter than those in summer, while the ones of methyl nitrate (MeONO<sub>2</sub>) were higher in summer than those in winter. Source analysis suggests that C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> were mainly derived from photochemical formation along with biomass burning (58.3-71.6%), while ocean was a major contributor to MeONO<sub>2</sub> (53.8%) during the whole sampling period. The photochemical evolution of C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> was investigated, and found to be dominantly produced by the parent hydrocarbon oxidation. The notable enrichment of MeONO<sub>2</sub> over C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> was observed in a summer episode when the air masses originating from the South China Sea (SCS) and MeONO<sub>2</sub> was dominantly derived from oceanic emissions. In order to improve the accuracy of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) prediction in coastal environment, the relative contribution of RONO<sub>2</sub> from oceanic emissions versus photochemical formation and their coupling effects on O<sub>3</sub> production should be taken into account in future studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
