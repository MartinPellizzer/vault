Participants were randomLy assigned to 4 groups: Group A, ozonated olive oil (OZO): Group B, ozonated olive oil and mineral wash: Group C, placebo olive oil (PPO) and mineral wash: Group D, placebo olive oil only. Active treatment was carried out in-clinic and followed by at-home care with a remineralising paste. The response to various pain stimuli was periodically assessed with a visual analogue scale. Additionally, scanning electron microscopic study assessed the dentinal tubule occlusion and change in tubular surface area after treatment.", "The group B participants showed a significant decrease in tooth level and global sensitivity over the period (P<0.001). Moreover, the intergroup comparison also revealed a significant result (P<0.001). Similarly, participants of group C also showed a significant reduction in sensitivity over the period (P<0.001). Whereas, no significant (P>0.05) difference was detected between group A and group D for tooth level and global sensitivity analysis. The SEM study result showed a significantly (P<0.001) enhanced tubule occlusion and decreased tubular surface area in group B specimens compared to other group specimens.", "OZO, as a mono-therapy is not efficient in reducing post-surgical RDH.
