In a predominantly urban location like Singapore, it is difficult to separate out the contribution of pollutants from mobile and point sources at different locations. In this work, a new approach is used by first modeling only the impact of point and area sources and then overlaying the traffic impact on air quality at different locations. Monthly scenario simulations are run with point, area and traffic sources of emissions for the Gaussian model validation. Street Canyon modeling is used for street segments surrounded by buildings on either side. A simplified photochemical model, which takes into account NO(x) undergoing chemical transformations in the urban atmosphere, is used to account for variations in NO(x) and ozone levels with respect to traffic data. The diurnal variation of NO(x) concentration levels is studied as a function of ozone levels at site, hourly traffic counts and meteorological parameters. The impact on ambient air quality within the breathing zone of the public from mobile sources, is found to be about 40% at urban stations although overall emissions from mobile sources is only 24%. The proposed approach appears to predict the variations in NO(x) as a function of traffic and meteorological conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent 119260, Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Viswanathan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng Choon", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10863012", "10.1016/s0304-3894(00)00189-8", "S0304-3894(00)00189-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
