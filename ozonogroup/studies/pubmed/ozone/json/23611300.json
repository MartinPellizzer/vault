Despite its common use, there are not many studies on imparting functionalities to those films which can make them more desirable for frozen food packaging. Here, commercial low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films were oxidized by UV-ozone (UVO) treatment to obtain a negatively charged hydrophilic surface to allow fabrication of functional multilayers. An increase in hydrophilicity was observed when films were exposed to UVO for 4 min and longer. Thin multilayers were formed by dipping the UVO-treated films into biopolymer solutions, and extracellular ice nucleators (ECINs) were immobilized onto the film surface to form a functional top layer. Polyelectrolyte adsorption was studied and confirmed on silicon wafers by measuring the water contact angles of the layers and investigating the surface morphology via atomic force microscopy. An up to 4-5 \u00b0C increase in ice nucleation temperatures and an up to 10 min decrease in freezing times were observed with high-purity deionized water samples frozen in ECIN-coated LDPE films. Films retained their ice nucleation activity up to 50 freeze-thaw cycles. Our results demonstrate the potential of using ECIN-coated polymer films for frozen food application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Rutgers University, 65 Dudley Road, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901-8520, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gezgin", "ForeName": "Zafer", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Tung-Ching", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qingrong", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Manufactured Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nanostructures"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23611300", "10.1021/jf400541q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
