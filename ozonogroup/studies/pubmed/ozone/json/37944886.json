Though PM<sub>2.5</sub> has been effectively mitigated in China, O<sub>3</sub> has been emerging as a primary pollutant, especially in summer. Currently, alleviating PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> synergistically faces huge challenges. The synergistic prevention and control (SPC) regions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and their spatiotemporal patterns were still unclear. To address the above issues, this study utilized ground monitoring station data, meteorological data, and auxiliary data to predict the China High-Resolution O<sub>3</sub> Dataset (CHROD) via a two-stage model. Furthermore, SPC regions were identified based on a spatial overlay analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The standard deviation ellipse was employed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of SPC regions. Some outcomes were obtained. The two-stage model significantly improved the accuracy of O<sub>3</sub> concentration prediction with acceptable R<sup>2</sup> (0.86), and our CHROD presented higher spatiotemporal resolution compared with existing products. SPC regions exhibited significant spatiotemporal variations during the Blue Sky Protection Campaign (BSPC) in China. SPC regions were dominant in spring and autumn, and O<sub>3</sub>-controlled and PM<sub>2.5</sub>-dominated zones were detected in summer and winter, respectively. SPC regions were primarily located in the northwest, north, east, and central regions of China, specifically in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTH), Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and Anhui provinces. The gravity center of SPC regions was distributed in the BTH in winter, and in Xinjiang during spring, summer, and autumn. This study can supply scientific references for the collaborative management of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
