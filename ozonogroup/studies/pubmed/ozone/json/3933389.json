Guinea pigs in groups of 5 were treated with BW 755C (10 mg/kg given intravenously), FPL 55712 (5 mg/kg given intravenously), or indomethacin (30 mg/kg given intraperitoneally) and studied before and 30 min after a 15-min exposure to 3.0 ppm ozone. These animals were compared with a similarly exposed group that was untreated (n = 10). Reactivity was determined by measuring specific airway resistance (SRaw) upon intravenous acetylcholine infusion in unanesthetized, spontaneously breathing animals. Prior to ozone exposure, we found that drug treatment did not affect either SRaw or muscarinic reactivity. After exposure to 3.0 ppm, all untreated guinea pigs showed substantial muscarinic hyperreactivity. Indomethacin treatment did not inhibit this effect. Furthermore, in the indomethacin-treated animals, marked elevations in SRaw after ozone occurred. In contrast, no change in SRaw or muscarinic reactivity occurred after ozone in any animal treated with either BW 755C or FPL 55712. We conclude that ozone-induced bronchial hyperreactivity in the guinea pig rapidly develops after a brief, high-level exposure. This effect may be mediated in part by lipoxygenase products derived from lung arachidonic acid metabolism post-ozone period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murlas", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-01535", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-34228", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "SRS-A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YG812J1I", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66000-40-6", "NameOfSubstance": "4,5-Dihydro-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-amine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8O730GH8AL", "NameOfSubstance": "FPL 55712"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "4,5-Dihydro-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-amine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chromones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "SRS-A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3933389", "10.1164/arrd.1985.132.5.1005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
