We show that adsorption in the nanotube interior sites as well as in the groove and exterior sites may be resolved by various experimental methods. In addition, the changes that the adsorbate phases undergo due to confinement in the nanotube interior are discussed, particularly focusing on confined molecules of water, alkanes, and an alkene. Attention is also devoted to the use of oxidizing agents such as ozone to open the ends and walls of nanotubes for interior adsorption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Surface Science Center, Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kondratyuk", "ForeName": "Petro", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yates", "ForeName": "John T", "Initials": "JT", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acc Chem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0157313", "ISSNLinking": "0001-4842"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17608447", "10.1021/ar700013c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
