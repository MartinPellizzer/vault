In this study, capacitive disinfection is applied as a pre-treatment for O<sub>3</sub> oxidation, in which manganese dioxide with a rambutan-like hollow spherical structure is used as the electrode to increase the charge density on the electrode surface. When a voltage is applied, the negative-charged microbes are attracted to the electrodes and killed by electrical interactions. The contact between microbes and capacitive electrodes leads to changes in cell permeability and burst of reactive oxygen species, thereby promoting the diffusion of O<sub>3</sub> into the cells. After O<sub>3</sub> penetrates the cell membrane, it can directly attack the cytoplasmic constituents, accelerating fatal and irreversible damage to pathogens. As a result, the performance of the capacitance-O<sub>3</sub> process is proved better than the direct sum of the two individual process efficiencies. The design of capacitance-O<sub>3</sub> system is beneficial to reduce the ozone dosage and DBPs with a broader inactivation spectrum, which is conducive to the application of ozone in primary water disinfection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
