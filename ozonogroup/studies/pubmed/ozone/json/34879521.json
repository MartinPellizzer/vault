Odour events caused by 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) mainly arising from filamentous cyanobacteria have been a very common problem in water supply. Removal rates of filamentous cyanobacteria and 2-MIB by conventional water treatment, such as coagulation, and disinfection treatment processes is low. Hence, a moderate pre-ozonation of cyanobacteria (with little cell damage) was proposed in this study as an enhanced coagulation step to remove filamentous cyanobacteria and intracellular 2-MIB effectively, while avoiding the release of intracellular 2-MIB. A post-peroxone (O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) process was applied after sand filtration to degrade the residual dissolved 2-MIB. Results show that moderate pre-ozonation (0.2\u00a0mg/L O<sub>3</sub> oxidation for 20\u00a0min) can substantially enhance the coagulation efficiency for algae, with low cell lysis and high cell viability. Furthermore, 2.0\u00a0mg/L O<sub>3</sub> combined with 2.0\u00a0mg/L H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can degrade the residual dissolved 2-MIB nearly 100% after 20\u00a0min reaction. Based on the optimal dosages, a 0.6\u00a0m<sup>3</sup>/h pilot system, including pre-ozonation, coagulation and sedimentation, sand filtration, and post-peroxone processes, was continuously run for 14 days, and it was found that the proposed process can effectively and stably remove filamentous cyanobacteria and 2-MIB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
