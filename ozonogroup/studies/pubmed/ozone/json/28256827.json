However, NO is highly reactive and rapidly converted to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) in the presence of ozone, making it impossible to directly measure <sup>15</sup>N in NO. Various wet-chemical methods for conversion of NO to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) have been proposed for <sup>15</sup>N analysis in high-concentration NO sources, such as combustion processes. In contrast, NO concentrations in the soil surface-near air are usually small (ppbv-range), posing major challenges to conversion efficiency and blank correction. Here, we present a modified method in which NO is oxidized quantitatively to NO<sub>2</sub> by chromium trioxide (CrO<sub>3</sub>), before conversion to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in an alkaline hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) solution. A denitrifier method was used to reduce NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the trapping solution quantitatively to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) for subsequent <sup>15</sup>N analysis. NO trapping efficiencies of >85% were obtained with 50 ppb NO in a 0.5 L min<sup>-1</sup> air stream bubbling through a solution of 1.2 M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 M NaOH. In a laboratory test with distinct <sup>15</sup>NO abundances, the overall precision was 0.29\u2030 (\u03b4-values) for natural abundance NO and 0.13 atom % for labeled NO, suggesting that our method can be used for both natural abundance studies and <sup>15</sup>N labeling experiments. In a soil incubation experiment with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub>, or Na<sup>15</sup>NO<sub>2</sub> amendments, we found distinct <sup>15</sup>N abundances in NO, indicating that our method is well suited to investigate NO sources in soils."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2047-445X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences , N-1432, Aas, Norway."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Ronghua", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences , N-1432, Aas, Norway."}], "LastName": "Mulder", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences , N-1432, Aas, Norway."}], "LastName": "D\u00f6rsch", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28256827", "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b05096"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
