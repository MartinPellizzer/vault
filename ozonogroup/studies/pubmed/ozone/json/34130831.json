The accurate identification of the nonlinear relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors is a prerequisite for formulating effective O<sub>3</sub> control measures. At present, precursor-based O<sub>3</sub> isopleth diagrams are widely used to infer O<sub>3</sub> control strategy at a particular location. However, there is frequently a large gap between the O<sub>3</sub>-precursor nonlinearity delineated by the O<sub>3</sub> isopleths and the emission source control measures to reduce O<sub>3</sub> levels. Consequently, we developed an emission source-based O<sub>3</sub> isopleth diagram that directly illustrates the O<sub>3</sub> level changes in response to synergistic control on two types of emission sources using a validated numerical modeling system and the latest regional emission inventory. Isopleths can be further upgraded to isosurfaces when co-control on three types of emission sources is investigated. Using Guangzhou and Foshan as examples, we demonstrate that similar precursor-based O<sub>3</sub> isopleths can be associated with significantly different emission source co-control strategies. In Guangzhou, controlling solvent use emissions was the most effective approach to reduce peak O<sub>3</sub> levels. In Foshan, co-control of on-road mobile, solvent use, and fixed combustion sources with a ratio of 3:1:2 or 3:1:3 was best to effectively reduce the peak O<sub>3</sub> levels below 145 ppbv. This study underscores the importance of using emission source-based O<sub>3</sub> isopleths and isosurface diagrams to guide a precursor emission control strategy that can effectively reduce the peak O<sub>3</sub> levels in a particular area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
