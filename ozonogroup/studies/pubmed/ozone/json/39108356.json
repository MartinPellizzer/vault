Although ASRs of ozone-related COPD death and DALY declined globally, they increased in low and low-middle Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions, with faster rise in women. Elevated average maximum temperature was associated with higher ozone-attributable COPD burden, while more green space was associated with lower burden.", "More efforts are needed in low and low-middle SDI regions, particularly for women, to diminish inter-country inequality in ozone-attributable COPD.
