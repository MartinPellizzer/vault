The aim of this study was to investigate the sealing capacity of the novel delivery system and its re-suction capacity during accidental displacement of the cup at different stages of ozone delivery.", "Ozone leakage was studied in vitro after application on a flat metal surface and on buccal and occlusal tooth surfaces. An ozone analyzer was used to measure ozone gas concentrations adjacent to the delivering cups when adapted to the target surfaces during and after 10-20 s application cycles. The measured levels were compared with the background concentrations in the room. Measurements were performed 1) after complete ozone application cycles, 2) within the cycle before the start of the suction period, and 3) after displacements of the cup during the cycles.", "Ozone air values varied between 8 and 166 microgram/meter-3 for the flat metal surface and between 0 and 108 microgram/meter-3 for the tooth surfaces. Ozone leakage levels were 7.6 microgram/m-3 for the flat and and 7.4 microgram/meter-3 and 5.6 microgram/meter-3 for the buccal and occlusal surfaces, respectively, and 5.2 microgram/meter-3 and 9.8 microgram/meter-3 for the premolar and molar surfaces, respectively. Cycles with displacement showed significantly higher leakage levels than continuous complete cycles (p=0.03).", "Ozone application cycles with displacements showed significantly higher leakage levels than continuous complete cycles. The largest ozone delivery cups showed the highest leakage values. A change in background levels was seen with similar change in adjacent ozone levels. The overall measured ozone leakage values were low after normally functioning delivery cycles and after repeated displacements. The delivery system can be considered safe."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental Hygienist Education, Department of Odontology, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden.
