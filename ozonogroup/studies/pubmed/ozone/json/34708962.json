Generalized additive models(GAMs) were adopted to explore the effects of different factors on O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The results showed that the relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and maximum temperature, sunshine hours, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, maximum mixed depth(MMD), and ventilation coefficient(VC) was non-linear. Specifically, the maximum temperature, sunshine hours, MMD, and relative humidity had a significant influence on O<sub>3</sub> concentration throughout the year. It is worth noting that the influence of relative humidity and precipitation on O<sub>3</sub> concentration during summer was more significant than that for the whole year. In the multi-meteorological factors GAMs of O<sub>3</sub> concentration, the meteorological factors mentioned above, except average wind, had significant impacts on O<sub>3</sub> concentration change. For the whole year, the judgment coefficient(<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) was 0.849 and the variance explanation rate was 85.1%. The maximum temperature was the most important influencing factor on O<sub>3</sub> concentration throughout the year. During summer, corresponding <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> was 0.811 and the explanation rate of variance was 81.3%; however, maximum temperature and MMD were the dominant meteorological factors. In the interaction GAMs, for the whole year, the interaction between maximum temperature and sunshine hours, relative humidity, and precipitation, and the interaction between sunshine hours and MMD had a significant impact on O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. The interaction between maximum temperature and sunshine hours played a leading role in changes of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The high temperature+strong radiation+MMD(about 2000 m) +no precipitation were conducive to the formation of O<sub>3</sub> concentration, but in summer, only the maximum temperature, sunshine hours, and VC had the most significant effect on the O<sub>3</sub> concentration, and strong high temperatures+strong radiation+the little horizontal wind in summer were conducive to the formation of O<sub>3</sub> concentration near the surface. In summary, GAMs model can not only be used to identify the dominant influencing factors of O<sub>3</sub> pollution, but also quantitatively analyze the influence of single effects and interaction of influencing factors on O<sub>3</sub> concentration, which has great significance for the prevention and control of O<sub>3</sub> pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu 610225, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu 610225, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Chang-Jian", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu 610225, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Xin-Yuan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu 610225, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shi-Gong", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu 610225, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ling", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu 610225, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jia-Xi", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu 610225, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun-Chao", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34708962", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202102056"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
