However, due to the deficiency of these treatments to completely degrade the ECs in wastewater, hybrid systems were explored using the distinguishing removal potential of the different treatment processes. This review gives an insight on such hybrid systems combining several physical, chemical and biological treatments for the fast and eco-efficient removal of ECs from wastewater. Most of the hybrid systems have applied biological treatments first and then physical or chemical treatments. The hybrid system of membrane bioreactor (MBR) followed by membrane filtrations (RO/NF) effectively removed a suite of ECs such as pharmaceuticals, beta blockers, pesticides and EDCs. Some of the hybrid systems of constructed wetlands and waste stabilization ponds showed promising potential for the biosorptive removal of pharmaceuticals and some beta blockers. The hybrid systems combining activated sludge process and physical processes such as ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO) and gamma radiations are considered as the cost effective technologies and had better removal of trace organic pollutants. The hybrid system of MBR coupled with UV oxidation, activated carbon and ultrasound, and ozonation followed by ultrasounds, completely degraded some ECs and many pharmaceuticals. The review also synthesizes the trend followed by the hybrid system processes for the removal of various categories of ECs. The future research directions for the ECs removal utilizing hybrid nanocomposites and green sustainable technology have been suggested."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
