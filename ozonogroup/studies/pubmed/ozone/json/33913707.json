The mechanistic understanding of this chemistry has been inconclusive despite extensive research, hindering accurate simulations of atmospheric processes. In this work, we examine the ozonolysis of two synthesized unsaturated carbonyl isomers (C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O) which separately produce the two Criegee intermediates (CIs) that would form simultaneously in \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis. Direct gas-phase measurements of peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>) from flowtube ozonolysis experiments by an iodide-adduct chemical ionization mass spectrometer suggest that the initial C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>O<sub>4</sub><b>\u00b7</b> RO<sub>2</sub> from the CI with a terminal methyl ketone undergo autoxidation 20-fold faster than the CI with a terminal aldehyde and always outcompete the bimolecular reactions under typical laboratory and atmospheric conditions. These results provide experimental constraints on the detailed RO<sub>2</sub> autoxidation mechanisms for understanding new particle formation in the atmosphere. Further, isomer-resolved characterization of the SOA formed from a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor using ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry suggests that the two structurally different CIs predominantly and unexpectedly form constituents with identical structures. These results open up possibilities of diverse isomerization pathways that the two CIs may undergo that form mutual products to a large extent toward their way forming the SOA. This work highlights new insights into \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis pathways and call for future studies to uncover the detailed mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zixu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, United States."}], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "Taylor", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of California, Merced, California 95343, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8084-8225"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, United States."}], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "David B C", "Initials": "DBC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7936-4493"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Haofei", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33913707", "10.1021/acs.est.1c02107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
