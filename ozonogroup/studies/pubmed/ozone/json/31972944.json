Aerosol samples were collected on a filter membrane for 24\u00a0h period and then analyzed for endotoxin. Air pollutants were measured for 24\u00a0h in living rooms while school children's lung function was measured. The modification of air pollutants on the relationship between airborne endotoxin and children's lung function was estimated after adjusting the gender, age, height, weight, and case-control status.", "We found that both O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations significantly modified the relationships between airborne endotoxin and school children's lung function.
