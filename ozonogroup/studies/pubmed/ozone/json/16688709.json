The epoxide groups of the PGMA chains were further reacted with acetic acid (AAc), oxalic acid (XAc), allyl amine (AA), and ethylenediamine (EDN) to introduce hydroxyl and amine groups to the surfaces of the PTFE films. Surface characterizations performed by Fourier Transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the surface modification and the chemical structure. The PGMA chains in arborescent structures show a high effectiveness for the enhancement of the adhesion of PTFE films. The adhesion of PTFE films was also significantly enhanced by ring-opening reactions of the PGMA epoxide groups with acetic acid and amine compounds. A high value of 9.5 N cm(-1) in the optimum 180 degrees peel strength test was observed with PTFE/copper assemblies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Chung Yuan University, Chungli, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Chen-Yuan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying-Ling", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Min-Tzu", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kueir-Rarn", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Juin-Yih", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Chemphyschem", "NlmUniqueID": "100954211", "ISSNLinking": "1439-4235"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16688709", "10.1002/cphc.200500729"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
