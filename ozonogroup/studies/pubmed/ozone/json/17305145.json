For the ozonation of secondary effluent, TOC was decreased only 10% when 4 (mgO3/mgC) of ozone consumption per initial TOC. However, UV254 and SUVA was decreased approximately 65% until ozone consumption of 2 (mgO3/mgC). Ozonation was also shown to be very effective for decrease of oestrogenicity in secondary effluent. Bromate ion started to form obviously when the ozone consumption per initial TOC exceeded 2 (mgO3/mgC) and increased while the time of ozonation became longer. From these results, ozone consumption per initial TOC was shown to be an appropriate operation parameter to reduce SUVA effectively and E2 equivalent concentration to less than 0.1 nM without significant formation of bromate ion, and its value was determined to be 2 (mgO3/mgC) in ozonation of secondary effluent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 373-1, Guseong-dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea. suekim1222@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuno", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17305145", "10.2166/wst.2007.035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
