Under a relative humidity of 65% and space velocity of 840,000 h<sup>-1</sup>, the 6%Ag/\u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-I catalyst showed 99% conversion of 40 ppm O<sub>3</sub> after 6 h, which was far superior to the performance of the 6%AgMnO<i><sub>x</sub></i>-C (49%), 6%Ag/MnCO<sub>3</sub>-I (32%), and \u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (5%) catalysts. Physicochemical characterization indicated that the chemical state of Ag on the Ag-Mn catalysts determined the O<sub>3</sub> decomposition activity of the catalysts. The Ag species on the 6%Ag/\u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-I catalyst were mainly metallic silver nanoparticles (Ag<sub>n</sub><sup>0</sup>), which exhibited much better ozone decomposition performance than the Ag<sub>1.8</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub> and oxidized silver clusters (Ag<sub>n</sub><sup>\u03b4+</sup>) existing on the 6%Ag/MnCO<sub>3</sub>-I and 6%AgMnO<i><sub>x</sub></i>-C catalysts. The 6%Ag/\u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-I catalyst still had above 85% ozone conversion after 60 h under a relative humidity of 65% and space velocity of 840,000 h<sup>-1</sup>. The slight deactivation of the catalyst was ascribed to the oxidation of Ag<sub>n</sub><sup>0</sup>, and its activity could be completely recovered by treatment at 350 \u00b0C under an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, which indicated that it is a promising catalyst for ozone decomposition. This research provides guidance for the subsequent development of Ag-Mn catalysts for ozone decomposition with high activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3097-2658"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaotong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-0669"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jinzhu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32786590", "10.1021/acs.est.0c02510"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
