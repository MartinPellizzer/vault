The results indicate that the relative deviation of total ozone from the MACC reanalysis data and the ground-based ozone total data is controlled within 17%, and all of the correlation coefficients were between 0.79 and 0.97. The total ozone values from the MACC reanalysis data showed good consistency with the ground-based ozone measurements. With respect to the spatial distribution of multi-year averages, the relative deviation of total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data and the AIRS satellite data was between -3% and 5%. The total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data were higher than those from AIRS measurements for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the coastal areas of South China, and were lower for northeast China. Furthermore, the seasonal variations in total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data were consistent with AIRS data. At Mt. Waliguan station, the monthly averaged trends for near-surface ozone in the MACC reanalysis data were also consistent with surface ozone concentrations; the MACC reanalysis data reflect the observed trends for surface-based ozone measurements in spring, summer, and autumn, but show a large deviation in winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Run-Fang", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-Dan", "Initials": "XD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Tian-Liang", "Initials": "TL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Lei", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Han", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Institute of Mountainous Environment and Climate, Guiyang 550000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854808", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201904029"]}}]}
