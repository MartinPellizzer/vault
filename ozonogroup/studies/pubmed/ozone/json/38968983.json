This study aimed to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ozone and the risk of AC. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study across five Chinese cities from 2014 to 2022. Daily outpatient visit records for AC were identified in five hospitals using either the diagnosis name or ICD-10 code H10.1. Data on air pollution and meteorological conditions were also collected. We first examined the city-specific association between short-term ozone exposure and AC using conditional logistic regression. A random-effects meta-analysis was then conducted to obtain overall estimates. During the study period, 130,093 outpatient visits for AC occurred, with 58.8% (76,482) being male and 41.2% (53,611) female. A one-standard-deviation (SD) increase in ozone was associated with an 8.3% increase (95% CI: 3.8%, 13.0%) in AC outpatient visits. Similar positive associations were observed when adjusting for other pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>) in two-pollutant and multi-pollutant models. Furthermore, the positive association remained consistent when using mixed-effects regression models or further adjusting for meteorological conditions. In addition, no effect modification of the AC-ozone association by sex, age and season was apparent. This study provides evidence supporting a positive association between short-term ozone exposure and AC risk in China. This highlights the potential value of mitigating ozone pollution to reduce the risk of ocular surface disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
