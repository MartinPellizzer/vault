Chemical and physical methods have been tried with varied levels of success. The present paper presents a novel electrostatic way of destroying Der p 1, the major mite allergen.", "To assess the efficacy of negative Trichel, negative continuous glow, positive pulse and positive continuous glow corona in destroying Der p 1. To determine whether ozone has any effect on the integrity of Der p 1 in the experimental conditions present.", "A simple point-to-plane apparatus was used to irradiate samples of Der p 1 for periods of 1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min. Controls were exposed to the atmosphere with no corona products present for the equivalent time. The effect of the corona by-product ozone was investigated alone by exposing samples of Der p 1 to molecular ozone for 60 min. Der p 1 concentration was quantified by two-site monoclonal antibody ELISA.", "High current negative glow resulted in a 67.37% reduction in Der p 1 concentration after 300 min compared with a 50.5% reduction from a low current Trichel regime. High current positive glow corona gave a reduction of 25.22% while a low current positive pulse corona caused a 13.72% reduction after 300 min. All these reductions were statistically significant (P < 0.05) compared with unexposed controls. Negative corona always gave greater percentage reductions in Der p 1 concentration for each time exposure investigated. The pattern of percentage reduction follows an exponential rise to maximum relationship in respect to time. Samples of Der p 1 were not affected by exposure to molecular ozone.", "These data indicate corona products to be a powerful new method of destroying Der p 1 allergen that is not dependent on the presence of the oxidizing corona product ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioelectrostatics Research Centre, Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton, UK. goodman_neil@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goodman", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "8906443", "ISSNLinking": "0954-7894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Dermatophagoides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Clin Exp Allergy. 2002 Apr;32(4):483-5. doi: 10.1046/j.0954-7894.2002.01351.x", "PMID": "11972590"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Dermatophagoides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Static Electricity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11972595", "10.1046/j.0954-7894.2002.01285.x", "1285"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
