The lowest corrosion rate and iron release, along with more Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> formation, occurred in DWDSs with O<sub>3</sub>-BAC-Cl<sub>2</sub> compared to those without a BAC filter. It was verified that O<sub>3</sub>-BAC influenced the bacterial community greatly to promote the relative advantage of nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) in DWDSs. Moreover, the advantaged NRB induced active Fe(III) reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation, enhancing Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> formation and inhibiting corrosion. In addition, O<sub>3</sub>-BAC pretreatment could reduce high-molecular-weight fractions of dissolved organic carbon effectively to promote iron particle aggregation and inhibit further iron release. Our findings indicated that the O<sub>3</sub>-BAC treatment, besides removing organic pollutants in water, was also a good approach for controlling cast iron corrosion and iron release in DWDSs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
