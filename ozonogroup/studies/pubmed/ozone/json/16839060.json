We have developed a technique based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify the acids, as well as other products, and applied it to the reactions of ozone with propene, trans-2-butene, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, and isoprene. Acetic acid yields from propene and trans-2-butene ozonolysis in the presence of an OH scavenger were 2.7 +/- 0.6 and 2.9 +/- 0.6%, respectively, under dry conditions and 1.8 +/- 0.4 and 2.3 +/- 0.5% at 65% RH. Isoprene ozonolysis produced methacrylic and propenoic acids with yields of 5.5 +/- 1 and 3.0 +/- 1%, under dry conditions and 4.1 +/- 1 and 1.5 +/- 0.3% under wet conditions, respectively. That water inhibits acid formation indicates that the water reaction with stabilized Criegee intermediates is at most a minor source of acids. Acids that may form as coproducts of the OH radical elimination pathway, acetic acid from 2,3-dimethylbutene and isoprene, and propenoic acid from isoprene were also observed with significant yields (up to 10%), although the production of acetic acid was not a linear function of the alkene reacted. Carbonyl products are also reported."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1565, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orzechowska", "ForeName": "Grazyna E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paulson", "ForeName": "Suzanne E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16839060", "10.1021/jp050166s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
