Toward understanding graphene oxide (GO) based nanomaterials considering the background factors, the present review study investigated their characteristics, preparation methods, and characterization processes. The removal of contaminants from wastewater has recently been a focus of attention for materials based on GO. Progress in GO synthesis and surface modification has shown that they can be used to immobilize enzymes. It is possible to immobilize enzymes with varying characteristics on graphene-oxide-based substrates without sacrificing their functioning, thus developing a new environmental remediation platform utilizing nano biocatalysts. GO doping and co-doping with a variety of heterogeneous semiconductor-based metal oxides were included in a brief strategy for boosting GO efficiency. A high band-gap material was also explored as a possibility for immobilization, which shifts the absorption threshold to the visible range and increases photoactivity. For water treatment applications, graphene-based nanomaterials were used in Fenton reactions, photocatalysis, ozonation, photo electrocatalysis, photo-Fenton, and a combination of photon-Fenton and photocatalysis. Nanoparticles made from GO improved the efficiency of composite materials when used for their intended applications. As a result of the analysis, prospects and improvements are clear, especially when it comes to scaling up GO-based wastewater treatment technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
