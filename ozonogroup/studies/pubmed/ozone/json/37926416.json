In this study, 23 OVOCs were monitored using a commercial proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer at an urban site in Shenzhen, China. During the campaign, the mean total concentration of OVOCs was 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.5\u00a0ppb (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation), with a total ozone formation potential (TOFP) of 87.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058.7\u00a0ppb. Aldehydes contributed the most to the concentration and TOFP of OVOCs, followed by ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids. Formaldehyde, acetone, and acetaldehyde were the three most abundant atmospheric carbonyls. An optimized photochemical age-based parameterization method was locally applied for the source apportionment of OVOCs. OVOCs in Shenzhen primarily originated from biogenic sources during the summer. Secondary anthropogenic sources were also important contributors of most carbonyl compounds. The campaign was divided into four periods. Two periods were dominated by the east wind from the relatively clean coastal areas, with the mean concentration of anthropogenic OVOCs largely decreasing during the Chinese National Day holidays. The other two periods were dominated by northwest wind and northeast wind, respectively, with larger OVOC contributions from anthropogenic sources, suggesting that pollution transport from the inland was a main contributor to OVOCs. This study highlights the important contributions of both local and regional OVOC sources in urban atmospheres."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
