This study was performed to compare ultrasound-guided corticosteroid versus ozone injections in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.", "Forty patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome were enrolled and randomly placed in one of the two groups of receiving a corticosteroid or ozone injection under ultrasound guidance. To determine the effectiveness of both injection techniques and compare their outcomes, visual analog scale and scores of Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, as well as ultrasound and electrodiagnostic criteria, were followed at 0, 6, and 12 wks after the injection.", "Both groups showed improvement in visual analog scale and Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire at week 6, and this improvement continued until the 12th week after the injections. However, electrodiagnostic values of sensory nerve action potentials and compound motor action potentials latency, and ultrasound carpal tunnel syndrome criteria showed significant improvement only among the subjects in the corticosteroid group at 6 and 12 wks after the injection (P < 0.05).", "Ozone might be as effective as corticosteroid injection in reducing pain and improving the function.
