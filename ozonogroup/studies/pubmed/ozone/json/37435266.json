Each group of wires was immersed in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O), NaF, and O<sub>3</sub> solutions for 90 minutes at 37<sup>o</sup>C. All samples were taken out of their solutions and washed with distilled water prior to testing. On a universal testing device, a three-point bending test was performed on 15 samples. Yield strength (YS), flexural modulus of elasticity (E), and springback ratio (YS/E) were calculated. The remaining five samples from respective solutions were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for surface topography evaluation.", "The mean differences in loading YS, E, and YS/E between NaF and O<sub>3</sub> are 41.14 MPa, 4.58 GPa, and -0.0006 whereas unloading values are 23.45 MPa, 4.38 GPa, and -0.0004, respectively with a statistical significance of <0.001. Surface topography alteration was appreciated in the NaF mouthwash group compared to the O<sub>3</sub> solution.", "The mechanical properties of 0.016\" Cu-Ni-Ti archwires during loading and unloading were changed after exposure to NaF mouthwash and O<sub>3</sub> solution. The mechanical properties of Cu-Ni-Ti archwires were more negatively affected by NaF mouthwash than by O<sub>3</sub> solution. Sodium fluoride mouthwash offers more corrosive changes when compared with the O<sub>3</sub> solution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Sukumar et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Sukumar", "ForeName": "Buddha", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Raghu Ram", "ForeName": "Rsvm", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Sunil", "ForeName": "Ghanta", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Ranganayakulu", "ForeName": "Inuganti", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Anand Viswanadh", "ForeName": "Kuchimanchi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "The effect of topical fluorides on decalcification in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances: a systematic review.
