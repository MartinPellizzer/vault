Existing studies are unable to provide sufficient quantitative assessments of the correlation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone pollution to support the coordinated control of the two air pollutants. This study develops a systematic method to comprehensively assess the correlation between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone pollution, including the evaluation of the impact of two air pollutants on human health and the extended correlation coefficient (ECC) for assessing the bivariate correlation index of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-ozone pollution in Chinese cities. According to the latest studies on epidemiology conducted in China, we take cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and respiratory diseases as the ozone pollution's health burden when evaluating the health impact of ozone pollution. The results show that the health impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in China decreases by 25.9\u00a0% from 2015 to 2021, while the health impact of ozone increases by 11.8\u00a0%. The ECC of 335 cities in China shows an increasing-decreasing trend but has generally increased from 2015 to 2021. The study provides important support for an in-depth understanding of the correlation and development trend of Chinese PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone pollution by classifying the comprehensive PM<sub>2.5</sub>-ozone correlation performances of Chinese cities into four types. China or other countries will get better environmental benefits by implementing different coordinated management approaches for different correlative types of regions based on the assessment method in this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
