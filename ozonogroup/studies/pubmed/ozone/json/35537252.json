These substances can cause disturbances on receiving waters, when not properly eliminated from the aquaculture effluents. In this work, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was investigated as a possible oxidizing agent to remove fishery antibiotics from aquaculture effluents: florfenicol (FF), oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim (TMP). Batch experiments were performed using ultrapure water and aquaculture effluents spiked with a mixture of target antibiotics at relatively high concentrations (10 mg L<sup>-1</sup> each). OTC, SMX and TMP were fully removed (< 30 min) regardless of the tested conditions, mainly by O<sub>3</sub> direct attack. In contrast, FF was partially removed in 30 min (\u223c 10 and 60%, in aquaculture effluents and ultrapure water, respectively), but only in the presence of hydroxyl radicals (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>), the FF concentrations reaching levels below the detection limits in ultrapure water after 60 min. In the case of SDM, its degradation was highly influenced by the selected water matrix, but with removals always higher than 68%. In continuous-flow experiments applying more environmentally relevant antibiotic concentrations (100 ng L<sup>-1</sup> each) and low O<sub>3</sub> doses (1.5 mg L<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>), ozonation highly removed (> 98%) all tested antibiotics from aquaculture effluents with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 min, except FF (68%). Although by-products were detected in treated samples, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryotoxicity tests did not show a toxicity increase by applying this ozonation treatment. Ozonation is thus a possible solution to remove antibiotics from aquaculture effluents. Still, full-scale studies in aquaculture farms are needed, and generation of HO<sup>\u2022</sup> may be favoured to readily oxidize the FF antibiotic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
