Although unsubstituted phenol is known to yield potentially genotoxic p-benzoquinone during ozonation, little is known about the effects of substitution of the phenol ring on transformation product formation. With batch experiments employing differing ozone/target compound ratios, it is shown that para-substituted phenols ( p-alkyl, p-halo, p-cyano, p-methoxy, p-formyl, p-carboxy) yield p-benzoquinones, p-substituted catechols, and 4-hydroxy-4-alkyl-cyclohexadien-1-ones as common ozonation products. Only in a few cases did para-substitution prevent the formation of these potentially harmful products. Quantum chemical calculations showed that different reaction mechanisms lead to p-benzoquinone, and that cyclohexadienone can be expected to form if no such pathway is possible. These products can thus be expected from most phenolic moieties. Kinetic considerations showed that substitution of the phenolic ring results in rather small changes of the apparent second order rate constants for phenol-ozone reactions at pH 7. Thus, in mixtures, most phenolic structures can be expected to react with ozone. However, redox cross-reactions between different transformation products, as well as hydrolysis, can be expected to further alter product distributions under realistic treatment scenarios."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , Ueberlandstrasse 133 , 8600 Duebendorf , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4169-661X"], "LastName": "Tentscher", "ForeName": "Peter R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , Ueberlandstrasse 133 , 8600 Duebendorf , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bourgin", "ForeName": "Marc", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , Ueberlandstrasse 133 , 8600 Duebendorf , Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) , \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , 1015 , Lausanne , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6852-8977"], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ketones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29560712", "10.1021/acs.est.8b00011"]}}]}
