A field experiment was performed to explore the role of warming and elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on N<sub>2</sub>O emission from wheat-soybean rotation cropland from 2012 to 2013 using open-top chambers (OTCs). Experimental treatments included ambient temperature (control), elevated temperature (+2\u00a0\u00b0C), elevated O<sub>3</sub> (100\u00a0ppb), and combined elevated temperature (+2\u00a0\u00b0C) and O<sub>3</sub> (100\u00a0ppb). Results demonstrate that warming significantly increased the accumulative amount of N<sub>2</sub>O (AAN) emitted from the soil-winter wheat system due to enhanced nitrification rates in the wheat farmland and nitrate reductase activity in wheat leaves. However, elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations significantly decreased AAN emission from the soil-soybean system owing to reduced nitrification rates in the soybean farmland. The combined treatment of warming and elevated O<sub>3</sub> inhibited the emission of N<sub>2</sub>O from the soybean farmland. Additionally, both the warming and combined treatments significantly increased soil nitrification rates in winter wheat and soybean croplands and decreased denitrification rates in the winter wheat cropping system. Our results suggest that global warming and elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations will strongly affect N<sub>2</sub>O emission from wheat-soybean rotation croplands."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
