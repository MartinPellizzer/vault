In this study, 41 samples involved 32 VOCs discharge links were collected from three factories. The EFs and VOCs source profiles were estimated by the material balance method and weighted average method, respectively. The ozone formation potential (OFP) of the 110 VOCs species were calculated by the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR). According to estimations, the ranges of EFs were 0.23-1.66\u00a0kg VOCs/SUV car and 2.14-14.86\u00a0g VOCs/m<sup>2</sup> painted area. EFs of six materials were firstly estimated, which are electrophoretic primer (152.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a097.39\u00a0g VOCs/SUV car, 0.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0g VOCs/m<sup>2</sup> painted area), sealant (48.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.20\u00a0g VOCs/SUV car, 0.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\u00a0g VOCs/m<sup>2</sup> painted area), floating coat (87.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a075.63\u00a0g VOCs/SUV car, 0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0g VOCs/m<sup>2</sup> painted area), colored paint (127.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0168.24\u00a0g VOCs/SUV car, 1.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.66\u00a0g VOCs/m<sup>2</sup> painted area), varnish (205.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0218.14\u00a0g VOCs/SUV car, 2.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.15\u00a0g VOCs/m<sup>2</sup> painted area), and cleaning solvent (328.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0404.94\u00a0g VOCs/SUV car, 3.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.98\u00a0g VOCs/m<sup>2</sup> painted area). OVOCs (37.40-51.60\u00a0%) and aromatics (36.40-37.00\u00a0%) were the dominant components. n-Butyl acetate, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, undecane, n-hexanal, acetone, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5 -trimethylbenzene, m/p/o-xylene, 3-ethylbenzene, and 4-ethylbenzene were the major VOCs species, accounting for 68\u00a0% of total VOCs in the automobile manufacturing industry. Considering the OFP values of species, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, m/p-xylene, acetaldehyde, methyl ethyl ketone are the key active species that should be prioritized for control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
