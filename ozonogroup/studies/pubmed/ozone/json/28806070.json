High levels of daytime Cl<sub>2</sub> up to \u223c450 pptv were observed. The average diurnal Cl<sub>2</sub> mixing ratios showed a maximum around noon at \u223c100 pptv. ClNO<sub>2</sub> exhibited a strong diurnal variation with early morning maxima reaching ppbv levels and afternoon minima sustained above 60 pptv. A moderate correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.31) between Cl<sub>2</sub> and sulfur dioxide was observed, perhaps indicating a role for power plant emissions in the generation of the observed chlorine. We also observed a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83) between daytime (10:00-20:00) Cl<sub>2</sub> and ClNO<sub>2</sub>, which implies that both of them were formed from a similar mechanism. In addition, Cl<sub>2</sub> production is likely associated with a photochemical mechanism as Cl<sub>2</sub> concentrations varied with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels. The impact of Cl<sub>2</sub> and ClNO<sub>2</sub> as Cl atom sources is investigated using a photochemical box model. We estimated that the produced Cl atoms oxidized slightly more alkanes than OH radicals and enhanced the daily concentrations of peroxy radicals by 15% and the O<sub>3</sub> production rate by 19%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta, Georgia 30332,
