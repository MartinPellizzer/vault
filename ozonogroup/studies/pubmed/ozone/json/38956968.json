Here, we propose a Cl<sub>2</sub> formation mechanism initiated by aerosol iron photochemistry to explain daytime Cl<sub>2</sub> formation. We implement this mechanism into the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and investigate its impacts on the atmospheric composition in wintertime North China where high levels of Cl<sub>2</sub> as well as aerosol chloride and iron were observed. The new mechanism accounts for more than 90% of surface air Cl<sub>2</sub> production in North China and consequently increases the surface air Cl<sub>2</sub> abundances by an order of magnitude, improving the model's agreement with observed Cl<sub>2</sub>. The presence of high Cl<sub>2</sub> significantly alters the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, with a factor of 20-40 increase in the chlorine radical concentration and a 20-40% increase in the hydroxyl radical concentration in regions with high aerosol chloride and iron loadings. This results in an increase in surface air ozone by about 10%. This new Cl<sub>2</sub> formation mechanism will improve the model simulation capability for reactive chlorine abundances in the regions with high emissions of chlorine and iron."]}, "AuthorList":
