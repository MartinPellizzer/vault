Three parallel treatment systems were used: the base system, where feed went directly to the activated sludge reactor, and two others, where the influent was ozonated at two different dosages, 15 and 25 mg/L of influent, prior to the biological reactors. The results from the ozonation chamber show a high oxidation capacity of the entering ammonia and organic nitrogen, proportional to the ozone dose. The oxidation product was nitrate. No de-nitrification was expected because a high oxygen concentration (4 mg/L) was maintained in the reactors. The reactors receiving ozonated influent showed a lower assimilation of nitrogen by the biomass. The sludge nitrogen content resulted in 11, 9.3 and 7.4% dry-weight corresponding to no-ozone, low ozone and high ozone dosages, respectively. In spite of the lower ammonia available in the ozonated flows, the corresponding reactors showed a higher specific nitrification rate. The ozonated system also performed better in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) removals, besides showing a higher true biomass yield coefficient."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Calidad Ambiental, ITESM, Av.
