In this review, the removal of micropollutants from aqueous matrices using various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, sulfate radical-based AOPs, ozonation, and Fenton-based processes has been comprehensively discussed. Most of the compounds were successfully degraded with an efficiency of more than 90%, resulting in the formation of transformation products (TPs). In this respect, degradation pathways with multiple mechanisms, including decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and halogenation, have been illustrated. Various techniques for the analysis of micropollutants and their TPs have been discussed. Additionally, the ecotoxicity posed by these TPs was determined using the toxicity estimation software tool (T.E.S.T.). Finally, the performance and cost-effectiveness of the AOPs at the pilot scale have been reviewed. The current review will help in understanding the treatment efficacy of different AOPs, degradation pathways, and ecotoxicity of TPs so formed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
