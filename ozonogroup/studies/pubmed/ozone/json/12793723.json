Therefore, it is important to determine correctly the biological effects of space radiation on human health. Studies about biological the effects at a low dose and a low dose-rate include various aspects of microbeams, bystander effects, radioadaptive responses and hormesis which are important fields in radiation biology. In addition, space radiations contain high linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In particular, neutrons may cause reverse effectiveness at a low dose-rate in comparison to ionizing radiation. We are also interested in p53-centered signal transduction pathways involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis induced by space radiations. We must also study whether the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of space radiation is affected by microgravity which is another typical component in space. To confirm this, we must prepare centrifuge systems in an International Space Station (ISS). In addition, we must prepare many types of equipment for space experiments in an ISS, because we cannot use conventional equipment from our laboratories. Furthermore, the research for space radiation might give us valuable information about the birth and evolution of life on the Earth. We can also realize the importance of preventing the ozone layer from depletion by the use of exposure equipment to sunlight in an ISS. For these reasons, we desire to educate space researchers of the next generation based on the consideration of the preservation of the Earth from research about space radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara, 634-8521, Japan. tohnishi@naramed-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "Takeo", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Akihisa", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "Ken", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Radiat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0376611", "ISSNLinking": "0449-3060"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cosmic Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Energy Transfer"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Radiobiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Relative Biological Effectiveness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weightlessness"}], "NumberOfReferences": "33"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12793723", "10.1269/jrr.43.s7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
