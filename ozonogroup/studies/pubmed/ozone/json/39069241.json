However, an increase in the frequency of elevated nocturnal ozone enhancement (NOE) and high nocturnal ozone value (HNOV) has been frequently observed in urban areas of eastern China, but the reasons are not well understood. In this study, taking a typical industrial city, ZiBo as a case study, we analyzed the trends, characteristics, and causes of the NOE and HNOV events in historical years by combining observations and model simulations. During the warm season (April-September) of 2017-2023, HNOV events are accompanied by low humidity, high temperature, large friction velocity, and a high boundary layer (52 days in total), whereas NOE events coincide with increases in humidity, wind speed, friction velocity, and boundary layer height (141 days in total). During the HNOV and NOE events, the nighttime average concentrations of O<sub>x</sub> were 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 and 12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> higher than the non-nocturnal O<sub>3</sub> period, indicating enhanced atmospheric oxidizing capacity during nighttime. The modeling results indicate that both the HNOV and NOE events were mainly driven by vertical mixing and regional transport. We selected a typical period with high O<sub>3</sub> pollution and frequent NOE and HNOV events to conduct the modeling study. Three typical nocturnal O<sub>3</sub> events are identified: Case I was mainly driven by horizontal transport; while in the two subsequent cases, the vertical transport contribution was 80\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> (20:00 LT on June 21, 2021) and 35\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> (02:00 LT on June 26, 2021), respectively. Our study reveals that the O<sub>3</sub> pollution in industrial cities has been extending to nighttime, primarily attributed to vertical mixing and horizontal transport within the boundary layer. This highlights the critical role of implementing regional joint control action to reduce primary emissions and eliminate residual ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
