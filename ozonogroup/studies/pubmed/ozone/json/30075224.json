The aim of this study was to initially elucidate whether ozone induces oxidative preconditioning by activating nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and secondly to determine whether ozone oxidative preconditioning (OzoneOP) protects the lung from IRI by attenuating nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammation, enhancing the antioxidant activity of Nrf2 and inhibiting apoptosis. Rats treated with or without OzoneOP (2\u202fml containing 100\u202f\u00b5g/kg/day) were subjected to 1\u202fh of lung ischemia followed by 2\u202fh of reperfusion for 10 days. Lung damage, antioxidant capacity, inflammation and apoptosis were evaluated and compared among different groups after reperfusion. OzoneOP significantly ameliorated changes in lung morphology and protected the lung from IRI by attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation-induced injury and lung apoptosis. Moreover, OzoneOP increased the expression of Nrf2 and decreased the levels of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC), un-cleavable cysteine-requiring aspartate protease-1 (procaspase-1), cysteine-requiring aspartate protease-1 (caspase-1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in the rat lungs. In summary, these results provide new insights into the molecular events modulated by ozone and suggest that ozone therapy may be an integrative support for patients with lung IRI."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
