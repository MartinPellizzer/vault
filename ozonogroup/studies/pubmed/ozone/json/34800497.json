Due to its chemical inertness and lack of UV absorption above 200\u00a0nm, this compound can easily come to the upper layers forming complexes with widely abundant atmospheric components, such as water. The radiation-induced degradation of this compound and its complexes may be significant for reliable prediction of its long-term evolution in the environment as well as for development of new ways for its removal. In this work we have studied the vibrational spectroscopic properties and mechanisms of the radiation-induced decay of the CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>\u22efH<sub>2</sub>O under the action of X-rays using matrix isolation FTIR spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The IR spectrum of the complex in an argon matrix was characterized for the first time and assigned to a hydrogen-bonded structure with a binding energy of 11.1\u00a0kJ/mol (2.65\u00a0kcal/mol) (CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory). Complexation with water leads to a certain suppression of the efficiency of the radiation-induced decomposition of difluoromethane. The obtained results provide evidence for the radiation-induced formation of previously unreported CF<sub>2</sub>\u22efH<sub>2</sub>O complex (in addition to other oxygen containing molecules, such as COF<sub>2</sub> and CO). As demonstrated by calculations, the new difluorocarbene complex reveals a hydrogen bond and it is characterized by a binding energy of 5.73\u00a0kJ/mol (1.37\u00a0kcal/mol) (CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
