The subjects were staff members working in these hospitals who provide direct medical or administrative services to patients and their families. The questionnaire inquired about the participants' basic attributes and workplace satisfaction, and included the sense of community scale and the Japanese version of the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale-II. We evaluated the scale's structural validity, internal consistency, and hypothesis testing for construct validity.", "Of 826 eligible staff members, 539 were included in the analysis. Mean age was 40.4\u2009years and 77.4% were female. Exploratory factor analysis showed that 24 of the 28 items in the sense of community scale could be categorized under 3 factors. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a goodness of fit index of 0.794, adjusted goodness of fit index of 0.752, comparative fit index of 0.885 and root mean square error of approximation of 0.092. Cronbach's \u03b1 for score in the sense of community scale was high (.96). Participants who reported high workplace satisfaction had significantly higher scores in the sense of community scale than those who indicated low workplace satisfaction (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.001).", "We verified the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the sense of community scale, which was originally developed for hospital wards, for the community in hospitals. With further verification, we hope the scale will be useful for evaluating the sense of community in hospitals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7315-2959"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Primary Care and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Goto", "ForeName": "Ryohei", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Education Center, School of Medicine, Keio University, Shinanomachi, Shinjuku ku, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Haruta", "ForeName": "Junji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Primary Care and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Sachiko", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Prim Care Community Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101518419", "ISSNLinking": "2150-1319"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Factor Analysis, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychometrics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "\nUnited Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division.
