Skin oil on the human surface acts as an ozone sink indoors, producing oxidation products that can cause skin and respiratory irritations. Concentrations of ozone and oxidation products near human surfaces, including the breathing zone, can be modulated by indoor ventilation modes and human surface conditions. The objective of this study is to examine concentrations and spatial heterogeneity of ozone and ozonolysis products under representative ranges of indoor ventilation, clothing, and breathing conditions. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in conjunction with a chemical kinetic model, details of ozone reactions with the human surface and subsequent chemical reactions are examined. The results show that primary ozonolysis products are concentrated near the soiled clothing, while the secondary products are relatively well distributed throughout the room. Increasing indoor air mixing enhances the ozone deposition to the human surface, thereby resulting in higher emission rates of oxidation products in the room. Soiled clothing consumes more ozone than clean clothing and accordingly produces\u00a0~\u00a065% more primary products and ~15% more secondary products. The results also reveal that unsaturated hydrocarbons from the human breath, such as isoprene, contribute to only ~0.5% of ozone removal compared to ozone deposition to the human surface."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S .
