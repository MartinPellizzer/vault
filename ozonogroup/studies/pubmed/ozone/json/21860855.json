TOBr can be measured using the adsorption-pyrolysis method according to Standard Method 5320B. This method involves that brominated organic DBPs are separated from inorganic halides and concentrated from aqueous solution by adsorption onto the activated carbon (AC). Previous studies have reported that some commonly known brominated DBPs can partially penetrate through the AC during this adsorption step. In this work, the penetration of polar brominated DBPs through AC and ozone-modified AC was explored with two simulated drinking water samples and one chlorinated wastewater effluent sample. Polar brominated DBPs were selectively detected with a novel precursor ion scan method using electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The results show that 3.4% and 10.4% of polar brominated DBPs (in terms of total ion intensity) in the chlorinated Suwannee River fulvic acid and humic acid samples, respectively, penetrated through the AC, and 19.6% of polar brominated DBPs in the chlorinated secondary wastewater effluent sample penetrated through the AC. The ozone-modification of AC minimized the penetration of polar brominated DBPs during the TOBr analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiangru", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krasner", "ForeName": "Stuart W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Chii", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Hongyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiaqi", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mengting", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21860855", "10.1039/c1em10397k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
