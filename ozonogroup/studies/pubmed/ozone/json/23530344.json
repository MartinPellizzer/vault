In both processes the medium pH affected the rate of ozone decomposition and the formation of hydroxyl radicals. The optimum values were achieved for the catalytic system under pH 7 with 93.0 and 47.7%, respectively, of total phenol content and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, after 120 minutes of reaction. For pH 3, the catalytic ozonation followed a free radical pathway perceived by the presence of radical scavengers. No significant structural differences were observed between the fresh and used solid catalyst in X-ray diffraction analysis. Aluminium leaching behaviour was also evaluated at the end of each experiment. Moreover, a sequence of feed-batch trials involving the catalyst reutilization exhibited almost constant activity during the operation time. Eco-toxicological tests were performed for both processes, revealing that the treated effluent still presents some ecological impact, although it is lower than that for the raw wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CIEPQPF- Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Engenharia dos Processos Qu\u00edmicos e Produtos da Floresta, GERSE- Group on Environment, Reaction and Separation Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fajardo", "ForeName": "Ana S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Rui C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quinta-Ferreira", "ForeName": "Rosa M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49DFR088MY", "NameOfSubstance": "Platinum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Olea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Platinum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23530344", "10.1080/09593330.2012.692720"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
