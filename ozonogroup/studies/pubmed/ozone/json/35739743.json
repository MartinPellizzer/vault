In this study, the oxidative combination of ozone with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) was for the first time used to remove 1,4-dioxane from water. Near complete abatement of 1,4-dioxane was achieved by ozone-PMS after reaction of only 15\u00a0min and the degradation kinetics was found to be positively correlated with doses of PMS and ozone. Ozone-PMS oxidation had the optimum performance at slight base pH values. Both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals were generated in ozone-PMS oxidation and these radicals resulted in the degradation of 1,4-dioxane. The effects of common water constituents and real water matrices were investigated. It was found that bicarbonate ions with a concentration up to 10\u00a0mM had a slight promoting effect, while either chloride ions or natural organic matter inhibited only slightly the degradation. Meanwhile, no obvious difference in the degradation of 1,4-dioxane was found among the real water matrices and deionized water, which demonstrates that ozone-PMS oxidation has high tolerance and stability. The results from this study demonstrate that ozone-PMS may be a promising technology for the removal of 1,4-dioxane from various water matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
