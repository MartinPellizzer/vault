In this work, O<sub>3</sub>/Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> was adopted to treat biologically-treated municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate in a microbubble gas-liquid reactor. The residual COD concentration is meeting the discharge standard after treatment. The effects of operating parameters such as Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> dosage, external reactor pressure, liquid temperature, inlet ozone concentration and ozone flow rate on COD removal and mineralization (TOC removal) were studied systematically. This process was able to remove 89.86% of COD, 65.35% of TOC and 92.12% of UV-254 under the optimal conditions. And the intensification mechanism of O<sub>3</sub>/Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> system was explored through analysing the change of UV-254, 3D-EEM and the organic matters present in the leachate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiaoxue", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3898-3324"], "LastName": "Quan", "ForeName": "Xuejun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Zhiliang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing College of Electronic Engineering, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Municipal Solid Waste Resource Utilization & Treatment Collaborative Innovation Center, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solid Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbubbles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31813333", "10.1080/09593330.2019.1703143"]}}]}
