In this study, we included 3487 urban adults from the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort. Individual inhalation exposure to air pollutants was estimated by combining participants' daily breath volume and ambient concentrations of six air pollutants (including fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), inhalable particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)). The cumulative impacts were assessed by applying lag structures of up to 7 days before the survey date. Associations of air pollutants with PLR and NLR were assessed using a linear mixed model and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) model. We found that PLR was negatively related to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (lag02-lag06), PM<sub>10</sub> (lag02-lag07), NO<sub>2</sub> (lag02-lag07), and SO<sub>2</sub> (lag03-lag05) and NLR was negatively related to PM<sub>10</sub> (lag05 and lag07). In the BKMR model, a negative joint association between the six-air-pollutant mixture and PLR and NLR was observed, whereas PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> appeared to be more important than the other pollutants in the mixture. The negative impact of air pollutants was stronger in males, participants with lower body mass index (< 24\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>), those cooking meals at home, drinkers, and non-exercisers. In conclusion, short-term exposure to air pollutants is significantly related to PLR and NLR in peripheral blood. PLR and NLR may provide new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the adverse health impact of air pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
