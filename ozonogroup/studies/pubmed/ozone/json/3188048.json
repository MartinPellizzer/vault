However, in polluted urban air, O3 and NO2 occur in combination. Therefore, this project was designed to investigate the pulmonary effects of combined O3 and NO2 exposures during intermittent exercise in adolescent subjects. Twelve healthy and twelve well-characterized asthmatic adolescent subjects were exposed randomly to clean air or 0.12 ppm O3 and 0.30 ppm NO2 alone or in combination during 60 minutes of intermittent moderate exercise (32.5 1/min). The inhalation exposures were carried out while the subjects breathed on a rubber mouthpiece with nose clips in place. The following pulmonary functional values were measured before and after exposure: peak flow, total respiratory resistance, maximal flow at 50 and 75 percent of expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity (FVC). Statistical significance of pulmonary function changes was tested by analysis of covariance for repeated measures. After exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 a significant decrease was seen in maximal flow at 50% of FVC in asthmatic subjects. After exposure to 0.30 ppm NO2 a significant decrease was seen in FVC also in the asthmatic subjects. One possible explanation for these changes is the multiple comparison effect. No significant changes in any parameters were seen in the asthmatic subjects after the combined O3-NO2 exposure or in the healthy subjects after any of the exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koenig", "ForeName": "J Q", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Covert", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Belle", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierson", "ForeName": "W E", "Initials": "WE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8602702", "ISSNLinking": "0748-2337"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3188048", "10.1177/074823378800400410"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
