In this study, however, O<sub>3</sub> is activated by S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, resulting in a superfast degradation of O<sub>3</sub>-refractory contaminants. Therefore, the focus of this study is the exploration into the enhancing role of S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the degradation of refractory organic contaminants by O<sub>3</sub>, which has been overlooked thus far. Results obtained from scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra verify that <sup>\u2022</sup>OH generated from the reaction of S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> with O<sub>3</sub> is mainly responsible for the superfast degradation of O<sub>3</sub>-refractory contaminants. The <sup>\u2022</sup>OH yield from the O<sub>3</sub>/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> process is determined to be 0.216. A plausible mechanism for the generation of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH from the O<sub>3</sub>/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> process is proposed with the implementation of density functional theory (DFT). Initially, ozone reacts with a sulfur of S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> to form OOOSSO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The adduct then rearranges to OO(O)SSO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> or HOO(O)SSO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the presence of H<sup>+</sup>, which cleaves to give a sulfoxide radical cation and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>/HO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022</sup>. O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>/HO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022</sup> is rapidly transformed into <sup>\u2022</sup>OH by O<sub>3</sub> through a series of steps. Degradation efficiency of O<sub>3</sub>-refractory contaminants of this process highly depends on the molar ratio of S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and O<sub>3</sub> ([S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]:[O<sub>3</sub>]). The optimal [S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]:[O<sub>3</sub>] is pH dependent in synthetic water (e.g. 0.3\u00a0at pH 7). The presence of bicarbonate inhibits the degradation of refractory contaminants by the O<sub>3</sub>/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> process. Humic acid exhibits a slight enhancing effect at low concentrations (0.1-0.2\u00a0mg-C/L), and an inhibiting effect at higher concentrations (\u22650.4\u00a0mg-C/L). In addition, the efficacy of the O<sub>3</sub>/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> process in real water matrices is also confirmed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
