This study examined four blending ratios of advanced treated reclaimed water from the F. Wayne Hill Water Resources Center (FWH WRC) in Gwinnett County, Georgia, combined with the existing drinking water treatment plant raw water supply, Lake Lanier, for potable water production. Baseline testing with 100 percent (%) Lake Lanier water was initially conducted; followed by testing blends of 15, 25, 50, and 100% reclaimed water from FWH WRC. Finished water quality from the DPR pilot was compared to drinking water standards, and emerging microbial and chemical contaminants were also evaluated. Results were benchmarked against a parallel indirect potable reuse (IPR) pilot receiving 100% of the raw water from Lake Lanier. Finished water quality from the DPR pilot at the 15% blend complied with the United States primary and secondary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs and SMCLs, respectively). However, exceedances of one or more MCLs or SMCLs were observed at higher blends. Importantly, reclaimed water from FWH WRC was of equal or better quality for all microbiological targets tested compared to Lake Lanier, indicating that a DPR scenario could lower acute risks from microbial pathogens compared to current practices. Finished water from the DPR pilot had no detections of microorganisms, even at the 100% FWH WRC effluent blend. Microbiological targets tested included heterotrophic plate counts, total and fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, somatic and male-specific coliphage, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococci, Legionella, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia. There were water quality challenges, primarily associated with nitrate originating from incomplete denitrification and bromate formation from ozonation at the FWH WRC. These challenges highlight the importance of upstream process monitoring and control at the advanced wastewater treatment facility if DPR is considered. This research demonstrated that ozone with biological filtration could achieve potable water quality criteria, without the use of RO, in cases where nitrate is below the MCL of 10\u202fmg nitrogen per liter and total dissolved solids are below the SMCL of 500\u202fmg per liter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
