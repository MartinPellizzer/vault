Ozonation effectively degrades naphthenic acids in OSPW, mitigating some of the toxicological effects of exposure. In this study we examined the effect of developmental exposure to raw and ozonated OSPW had on the breeding success, prey capture, and alarm cue response in fish months/years after exposure and the transgenerational effect exposure had on gene expression, global DNA methylation, and larval basal activity. Exposure to raw and ozonated OSPW had no effect on breeding success, and global DNA methylation. Exposure altered the expression of vtg and nkx2.5 in the unexposed F1 generation. Exposure to both raw and ozonated OSPW had a transgenerational impact on larval activity levels, anxiety behaviors, and maximum swim speed compared to the control population. Prey capture success was unaffected, however, the variability in the behavioral responses to the introduction of prey was decreased. Fish developmentally exposed to either treatment were less active before exposure and did not have an anxiety response to the alarm cue hypoxanthine-3-n-oxide. Though ozonation was able to mitigate some of the effects of OSPW exposure, further studies are needed to understand the transgenerational effects and the implications of exposure on complex fish behaviors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
