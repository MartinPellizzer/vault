The photochemical reaction products of propylene plus NO2 were produced by photochemical reaction of a propylene-NO2/dry air system in a photochemical smog chamber and then were exposed to cell cultures for 2 h. SCEs were induced at all concentrations of the photochemical reaction products employed in the present study, the frequency of SCEs being two or three times higher than that of the controls. The genetic effects of NO2 and ozone (O3) were also studied and compared with those of the photochemical reaction products of propylene plus NO2. NO2 and O3 both induced SCEs in V79 cells, but their effects were weaker than those induced by the photochemical reaction products of propylene plus NO2. It was ascertained that the photochemical reaction of the propylene-NO2/dry air system produced much stronger genotoxic factors than the reactants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shiraishi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bandow", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AUG1H506LY", "NameOfSubstance": "propylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sister Chromatid Exchange"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4032499", "10.1080/15287398509530680"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
