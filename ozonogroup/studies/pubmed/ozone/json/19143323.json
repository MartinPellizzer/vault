Reduced photonic efficiency of immobilized TiO2 is a major challenge in TiO2-assisted advanced oxidation processes (AOP). Mineralization of 2,4-dichllorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in low aqueous solution by O3/UV/TiO2 using the world's first high-strength TiO2 fiber was investigated and compared with O3, UV/TiO2, and O3/TiO2 in laboratory batch experiments. The 2,4-D degradation and total organic carbon (TOC) removal followed pseudo first-order reaction kinetic, while their rates in O3/UV/TiO2 were respectively about 1.5 and 2.4 times larger than the summation of the values in 03 and UV/TiO2. The O3/UV/TiO2 was characterized by few aromatics with very low abundance, fast disappearance of aliphatics and more than 95% dechlorination. The discrepancies in organic carbon mass balance among the intermediates and 2,4-D were attributed mainly to few apparently major unidentified intermediates. The significantly enhanced 2,4-D mineralization in O3/UV/TiO2 was attributed to increased ozone dissolution followed by its decomposition, and reduced electron-hole recombination in presence of dissolved ozone resulting in a large number of hydroxyl radical (*OH) generation from more than one parallel path. The removal efficiencies of the systems can further be enhanced by optimizing design parameters, and O3/UV/TiO2 with the TiO2 fiber is promising to mineralize recalcitrant organic contaminants in water at low concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Industrial R & D Center Osaka Sangyo University, 3-1-1 Nakagaito, Daito City, 574-8530 Osaka, Japan. rabindra@cnt.osaka-sandai.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giri", "ForeName": "Raj Rabindra", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozaki", "ForeName": "Hiroaki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takanami", "ForeName": "Ryohei", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taniguchi", "ForeName": "Shogo", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19143323", "10.1016/s1001-0742(08)62161-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
