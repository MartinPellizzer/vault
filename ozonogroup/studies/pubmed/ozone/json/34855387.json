Data analysis identified more than 70 odorants with concentrations ranging from not detected to thousands of ng/L. In raw water, Pearson correlation analysis determined that thioethers, non-oxygen benzene-containing compounds, and pyrazines were classes of chemicals that co-occurred, and geosmin and <i>p</i>(<i>m</i>)-cresol, as well as cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, also co-occurred, indicating similar natural or industrial sources. Based on classification and regression tree analysis, total dissolved organic carbon and geographical location were identified as major factors affecting the occurrence of thioethers. Indoles, phenols, and thioethers were well-removed through conventional and advanced treatment processes, while some aldehydes could be generated. For other odorants, higher removal was achieved by ozonation-biological activated carbon (39.3%) compared to the conventional treatment process (14.5%). To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically identify the major odorants in raw water and determine suitable treatment strategies to control their occurrence by applying data analytics and statistical methods to the complex dataset. These provide informative reference for odor control and water quality management in drinking water industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
