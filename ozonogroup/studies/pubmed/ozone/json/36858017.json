In this study, the degradation of ketamine, an environmentally persistent pharmaceutical, under sunlight irradiation in the presence of a low concentration of chlorine (1\u00a0mg/L as Cl<sub>2</sub>) was investigated to elucidate the evolution of reactive species and their contribution to ketamine removal. \u2022OH dominates the initial stage of sunlight/chlorine; however, after chlorine depletion, reactions still progress with an observed rate constant (k<sub>obs</sub>\u00a0=\u00a07.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) an order of magnitude higher than photolysis alone (k<sub>obs</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>). When chlorine is depleted, O<sub>3</sub> becomes the major reactant that degrades ketamine. High O<sub>3</sub> yields were found in both sunlight/HOCl (12.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5% at pH 5) and sunlight/ClO<sup>-</sup> (10 \u00b1 1% at pH 10) systems. At sub-\u00b5M levels, O<sub>3</sub> resulted in substantial removal of ketamine, and even faster rates were observed in the presence of sunlight. A kinetic model was also established, and evaluate time-dependent concentration levels during sunlight/chlorine. The model simulation showed that the cumulative O<sub>3</sub> concentration could reach 0.91\u00a0\u03bcM, and O<sub>3</sub> contributed 31% ketamine removal during the sunlight/chlorine process. Primary and secondary amine functional groups were demonstrated to be the reaction sites of O<sub>3</sub>; other pharmaceuticals, such as atenolol and metoprolol, underwent similar phenomena. In addition, the experimental and model results further indicated that sunlight/ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> or ClO<sub>2</sub> also participates in the degradation of ketamine with a minor role; trace amounts (below nM level) of ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and ClO<sub>2</sub> were estimated by the simulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
