An increase in the BOD(5)/COD ratio from 0.11 to 0.28 and 87% color abatement in terms of Pt-Co were achieved by catalytic ozonation, which had the best treatment performance. Biodegradability enhancement of the CEH effluent correlated well with a decrease in toxicity, high-molecular-weight-compound content, and AOX abatement. By the pre-treatment of the CEH bleaching effluent, the overall efficiencies of algal treatment of the combined pulp mill effluent in terms of the fractional removal of COD and color were increased from 76% and 53% to 86-90% and 96-99%, respectively. Effects of both the conventional and the catalytic ozonation pre-treatments on subsequent biological treatment were close to each other and they reduced the filling period of the Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) cycle from 8 to 5 days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Institute of Environmental Sciences, 34342 Bebek-Istanbul, Turkey. balciogl@boun.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balcio\u011flu", "ForeName": "I Akmehmet", "Initials": "IA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tarlan", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kivilcimdan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sa\u00e7an", "ForeName": "M T\u00fcrker", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Manage", "NlmUniqueID": "0401664", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyta"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17188420", "10.1016/j.jenvman.2006.10.020", "S0301-4797(06)00335-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
