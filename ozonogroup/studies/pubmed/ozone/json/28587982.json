It can cause neurologic deficits ranging from paresthesia to paralysis. This study evaluated the effect of ozone therapy on sciatic nerve crush injury in rats.", "Twenty-four male rats were divided into control sham surgery, sciatic nerve injury, and sciatic nerve injury with ozone groups (each n\u00a0= 8). The sciatic nerve injury was inflicted via De Koning's crush-force method. The sciatic nerve injury group received medical air and the sciatic nerve injury ozone group received 0.7 mg/kg ozone. Sciatic nerve samples were obtained 4 weeks after injury. Vascular congestion, vacuolization, edema formation, S100 expression, and the thicknesses of the perineurium and endoneurium and diameter of the injured sciatic nerves were evaluated.", "The diameter of the sciatic nerve and thicknesses of the perineurium and epineurium were significantly greater in the sciatic nerve injury group (P\u00a0< 0.05) and significantly less in the sciatic nerve injury with ozone group (P < 0.001). High S100 immunoreactivity was seen in the sciatic nerve injury group compared with the other 2 groups (P < 0.05). The distributions of vascular congestion and vacuolization were significantly less in the sciatic nerve injury with ozone group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "Ozone therapy improved sciatic nerve injury recovery without causing an increase in fibrotic tissue. Ozone reduced fibrosis, vascular congestion, vacuolization, and edema in rodents. Ozone treatment might be used to assist in sciatic nerve injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
