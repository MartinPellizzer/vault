The n-type transition metal oxides are known for their ion storage properties. However, the fabrication methods of their amorphous metal oxide thin films typically involve sputtering, thermal deposition, electrical deposition, or sol-gel deposition followed by high-temperature thermal annealing (>300 \u00b0C), thus making them incompatible for low-cost roll-to-roll manufacturing on flexible substrates. In this study, we report the synthesis of amorphous niobium oxide(a-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) thin films from sol-gel precursors through the combination of photoactivation and low-temperature thermal annealing (150 \u00b0C). Coupled with p-type electrochromic polymers (ECPs), solution-processed a-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> thin films were evaluated as a minimally color changing counter electrode (MCC-CE) material for electrochromic devices. We found that ultraviolet ozone (UVO) treated and 150 \u00b0C\u00a0thermally annealed (UVO-150 \u00b0C)\u00a0a-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> thin films\u00a0show excellent electrochemical properties and cycling stability. Notably, a-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/ECP-magenta ECD has a high optical contrast of \u223c70% and a fast switching time (bleaching and coloring time of 1.6 and 0.5 s for reaching 95% of optical contrast). In addition, the ECD demonstrates a high coloration efficiency of \u223c849.5 mC cm<sup>-2</sup> and a long cycling stability without a noticeable decay up to 3000 cycles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Purdue University , 560 Oval Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jiazhi", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Purdue University , 560 Oval Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Liyan", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Purdue University , 560 Oval Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tran", "ForeName": "Dung T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Purdue University , 560 Oval Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5743-2715"], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30608143", "10.1021/acsami.8b16154"]}}]}
