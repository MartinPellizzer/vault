An overwhelming host response may result in compromised respiration and acute lung injury, which is characterized by lung neutrophil recruitment as a result of the patho-logical host immune, coagulative and tissue remodeling response. Sensitive microscopic methods to visualize and quantify murine lung cellular adaptations, in response to low-dose (0.05 ppm) ozone, a potent environmental pollutant in combination with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a TLR4 agonist, are crucial in order to understand the host inflammatory and repair mechanisms. We describe a comprehensive fluorescent microscopic analysis of various lung and systemic body compartments, namely the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, lung vascular perfusate, left lung cryosections, and sternal bone marrow perfusate. We show damage of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, lung parenchymal tissue, as well as bone marrow cells in correlation with a delayed (up to 36-72 h) immune response that is marked by discrete chemokine gradients in the analyzed compartments. In addition, we present lung extracellular matrix and cellular cytoskeletal interactions (actin, tubulin), mitochondrial and reactive oxygen species, anti-coagulative plasminogen, its anti-angiogenic peptide fragment angiostatin, the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex V subunits, \u03b1 and \u03b2. These surrogate markers, when supplemented with adequate in vitro cell-based assays and in vivo animal imaging techniques such as intravital microscopy, can provide vital information towards understanding the lung response to novel immunomodulatory agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Small Animal Clinical Sciences, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan."}], "LastName": "Duda", "ForeName": "Jessica Andrea Brocos", "Initials": "JAB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Small Animal Clinical Sciences, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Manpreet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Small Animal Clinical Sciences, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan; gurpreet.aulakh@usask.ca."}], "LastName": "Aulakh", "ForeName": "Gurpreet K", "Initials": "GK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Lung Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophil Infiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "37"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33818567", "10.3791/62097"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
