The PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related global premature mortality is estimated to be 4.3 and 4.4 million by the non-linear and linear models, respectively. Ischemic heart diseases are found to be the leading cause of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related premature deaths, contributing by 35% globally. Both long-term and short-term O<sub>3</sub>-related premature deaths are estimated to be around 1 million, globally. Overall, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>-related premature mortality leads to 5.3-5.4 million premature deaths, globally. The global burden of premature deaths is mainly driven by the Asian region, which in 2015 contributes by 75% of the total global premature deaths. An increase from 6.2% to 8% in the PM<sub>2.5</sub> relative risk as recommended by the WHO leads to an increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related premature mortality by 28%, to 5.7 million. Finally, bias correcting the simulated PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in 2015 leads to an increase of up to 73% in the global PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related premature mortality, leading to a total number of global premature deaths of up to 7.7 million, implying the necessity of bias correction to get more robust health burden estimates. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>-related premature mortality in 2050 decreases by up to 57% and 18%, respectively, due to emission reductions alone. However, the projected increase and aging of the population leads to increases of premature mortality by up to a factor of 2, showing that the population exposed to air pollution is more important than the level of air pollutants, highlighting that the population dynamics should be considered when setting up health assessment systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
