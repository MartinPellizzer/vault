Cascading the life cycles of plastic losses with solid waste reclamation via re-manufacturing virgin polymers or producing fuels and energy may extend resource availability while minimizing waste generation and environmental exposure. Here, we systematically investigate this cascaded plastic waste processing over other waste end-of-life management pathways by analyzing the environmental consequences of plastic losses across the entire life cycle. Plastic losses can form volatile organic chemicals via photo-degradation and pose non-negligible global warming, ecotoxicity, and air pollution effects that worsen by at least 189% in the long run. These environmental burdens increase by above 9.96% under high ultraviolet radiation levels and participation rates, which facilitate plastic particulate compartment transport and degradation. Cascaded plastic waste processing aided by fast pyrolysis upcycling technologies can effectively cut environmental losses and outperform landfills and incineration in reducing 23.35% ozone formation and 19.91% air pollution by offsetting the external monomer manufacturing and fuels and energy production while saving at least 25.75% fossil fuels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Systems Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9609-4299"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Systems Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, United States."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Fengqi", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Cycle Stages"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37058399", "10.1021/acs.est.2c08686"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
