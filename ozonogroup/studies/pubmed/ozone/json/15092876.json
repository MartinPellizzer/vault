Cumulative O(3) exposure expressed as the sum of hourly mean concentrations above the canopy ranged between 100 and 150 microl l(-1) h, with the vertical O(3) profiles at the higher altitude site being enhanced by 30%. O(3) profiles at all sites were reduced by up to 20% with increasing depth within and beneath the canopy. The leaf discoloration that developed in the absence of premature leaf loss was similar in the sun foliage of mature and young trees (including plant grown in the phytotron). Injury became apparent at low O(3) exposures, expressed as accumulated hourly means over a threshold of 40 nl l(-1) (AOT40 <3.5 microl l(-1) h) at the lower site in both the mature trees and the young beech at the field site, but only occurred when AOT40 values reached 7 microl l(-1) h at the upper site, and 6 microl l(-1) h in the phytotrons. However, the association between injury and O(3) exposure was improved when cumulative ozone uptake to sun leaves was the ozone index, used with values of about 3 mmol m(-2) resulting in visible injury in both mature and young beech growing in phytotrons. Under high ozone exposure levels of inositol were lowered, whilst concentrations of lignin-like materials were enhanced in mature beech. Similar responses were observed in young beech grown in phytotrons. As the sun foliage was affected by only a small and variable extent each year, the seasonal O(3) impact at high altitude did not appear to pose an acute risk to mature beech trees."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forest Botany, University of Munich, Am Hochanger 13, D-85354 Freising, Germany. baumgarten@boku.forst.uni-muenchen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baumgarten", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Werner", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00e4berle", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emberson", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabian", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092876", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00046-4", "S0269-7491(00)00046-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
