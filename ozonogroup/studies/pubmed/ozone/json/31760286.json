This study aimed to investigate the potential association between fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and AAD onset. We collected new episodes of AAD between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 from the emergency department of a major hospital in Shanghai, China. The overdispersed generalized additive model was used to estimate the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and AAD emergency hospitalizations and was adjusted for time trends and weather conditions. During the study period, we identified a total of 1335 cases of AAD hospitalizations and recorded an average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration of 45\u202f\u00b1\u202f30\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. The association was statistically significant on the concurrent day of hospital admission, remained on the lag 1 day. For the average of the two lags, a 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with 3.38% (95% confidence interval: 1.02%, 5.79%) increase of AAD hospitalizations. The association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and AAD remained when adjusting for the concomitant exposures to coarse particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone. The concentration-response curves increased apparently when daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was beyond the China's National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). In stratified analyses, the significant association was only present among elders and males, and during cool season. This investigation demonstrated a significant and robust association between short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and increased AAD hospitalizations in Shanghai, China. Our findings have important implications for the prevention of AAD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
