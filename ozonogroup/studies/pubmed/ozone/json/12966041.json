Hydrogen peroxide accumulation only occurred in the apoplast and this temporally coincided with the fumigation period. The inhibitor experiments suggested that both the plasma membrane-bound NAD(P)H oxidase complex and cell-wall NAD(P)H PODs contributed to H2O2 generation. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for O3-induced H2O2 accumulation further, both production and scavenging of H2O2 were investigated in the extracellular matrix after subcellular fractionation. The results indicated that H2O2 accumulation is a complex and highly regulated event requiring the time-dependent stimulation and down-regulation of differently located enzymes, some of which are involved in H2O2 generation and degradation, not only during the fumigation period but also in the subsequent recovery period in non-polluted air. Owing to the possible interplay between H2O2 and ethylene, the time-course of ethylene emission was analysed too. Ethylene was rapidly emitted following O3 exposure, but it declined to control values as early as after 4 h of exposure. The early contemporaneous detection of increased ethylene and H2O2 levels after 30 min of exposure does not allow a clear temporal relationship between these two signalling molecules to be established."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Biotechnology, University of Pisa, Via del Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy. aranieri@agr.unipi.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ranieri", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castagna", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pacini", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baldan", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mensuali Sodi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soldatini", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADPH Oxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Helianthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NADPH Oxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12966041", "10.1093/jxb/erg270", "erg270"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
