AM increases the secretion of phosphatidylcholine by type II pneumocytes, which suggests a role as an autocrine modulator of surfactant secretion. In this study we show the expression of an AM-like protein in the lung of the pigeon, Columba livia. Using an antibody against its human ortholog, AM-like immunoreactivity was found to be associated with membranous structures of the multivesicular bodies of type II pneumocytes. We also studied the differential expression of AM-like peptide in the lung of pigeons exposed to polluted city air vs cleaner countryside conditions and found that AM-like expression was higher in city animals. Similar results were obtained in an experimental study in which pigeons were exposed to increasing concentrations of a single pollutant, ozone. Taken together, our findings support the implication of AM in the response of type II pneumocytes to air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. ncuesta@som.umaryland.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cuesta", "ForeName": "Natalia", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "Alfredo", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cuttitta", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zudaire", "ForeName": "Enrique", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Histochem Cytochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9815334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1554"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "148498-78-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenomedullin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adrenomedullin"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Columbidae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15928326", "10.1369/jhc.4A6498.2005", "53/6/773"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
