A stereoscopic measurement campaign (satellite remote sensing, hyperspectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing and MAX-DOAS observation) was performed in a typical inland city Hefei and its surrounding agricultural fields from June to October 2022. Average aerosol vertical profiles exhibited a Gaussian shape above 100\u00a0m with maximum values of 0.67\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> and 0.55\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> at 300-400\u00a0m layer at Anhui University (AHU) and Changfeng (CF), respectively. The distinct layered structure was mainly attributed to regional transport. Average H<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>2</sub> vertical profiles all showed a Gaussian shape and an exponential shape at AHU and CF, respectively. Moreover, the diurnal evolution of H<sub>2</sub>O profiles performed one peak and bi-peak patterns at AHU and CF, respectively, whereas the diurnal evolution of NO<sub>2</sub> at two stations all exhibited bi-peak patterns attributed to vehicle emissions. Average HONO vertical profiles showed an exponential shape and a Gaussian shape at AHU and CF, respectively. Higher HONO (> 0.05\u00a0ppb) above 1.0\u00a0km at 14:00-16:00 was observed at CF. The transport flux analysis showed that the northern transport flux always larger than southern transport flux for aerosol and H<sub>2</sub>O. The maximum northern transport fluxes appeared at 300\u00a0m and surface for aerosol and H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. It indicated that surrounding agricultural fields was an important source of atmospheric H<sub>2</sub>O of city. The southern transport flux was larger than northern transport flux for NO<sub>2</sub>, with a maximum net transport flux of 9.20\u00a0ppb\u00a0m\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> at 100\u00a0m. It demonstrated that NO<sub>2</sub> transported from urban areas was an important source of NO<sub>2</sub> in agricultural fields. For HONO, the southern transport flux was larger than northern transport flux under 100\u00a0m, whereas it was opposite above 100\u00a0m. It indicated that the HONO distributed at high altitudes at agricultural fields had potential to enhance the atmospheric oxidation capacity of urban area. The net horizontal transport fluxes of HONO of our defined cropland were 5.25\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and -3.65\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> during non-fertilization and fertilization periods, respectively. It indicated that the cropland could obviously export HONO to surrounding atmosphere during the fertilization period. Deducing the contribution of direct emission, heterogeneous process was a major source of HONO at urban and agricultural areas. The average surface conversion rate of NO<sub>2</sub>-to-HONO (C<sub>HONO</sub>) was 0.01467\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>, and this value decreased with the increase of height at urban station. While average surface C<sub>HONO</sub> was 0.0322\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> at agricultural fields, which was ~1.2-2.8 times higher than that at urban area. The C<sub>HONO</sub> at agricultural fields significantly increased with the increase of height. The average C<sub>HONO</sub> at 1.0\u00a0km was ~2.0-3.6 times higher than that at surface. That suggested that the heterogeneous process was the main HONO source at high altitudes at CF, and this process obviously correlated with aerosol and H<sub>2</sub>O. The higher OH production from HONO (P(OH)<sub>HONO</sub>) occurred at 0-200\u00a0m and 100-400\u00a0m with averaged values of 0.31\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.39\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> at AHU and CF, respectively. The high P(OH)<sub>HONO</sub> above 1.0\u00a0km at CF from September to October was strongly correlated with high O<sub>3</sub> (> 80\u00a0ppb). This study emphasized the importance of the stereoscopic of HONO on the analysis of its distribution, evolution, source and atmospheric oxidizing contribution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
