Several recent studies have suggested that in estimating exposure dose (O3 concentration [C] x exposure time [T] x ventilation [V]), O3 concentration needs to be weighted more heavily than either ventilation or duration of exposure in the estimates. In this study we tested the hypothesis that regardless of concentration pattern and exposure rate the same exposure dose of O3 will induce the same spirometric response. We exposed 23 healthy male volunteers (20 to 35 yr of age) for 8 h to air, 0.12 ppm O3 (steady-state), and a triangular exposure pattern (concentration increased steadily from zero to 0.24 ppm over the first 4 h and decreased back to zero by 8 h). During the first 30 min of each hour, subjects exercised for 30 min at minute ventilation (VE) approximately 40 L/min. The order of the exposures was randomized, and the exposures were separated by at least 7 days. The response patterns over the 8-h periods for spirometric variables in both O3 exposures were statistically different from air exposure changes and from each other. For FEV1 the p values were 0.017 between air and steady-state profile, 0.002 between air and triangular profile, and 0.037 between steady-state and triangular profiles. Although in the triangular pattern of exposure the maximal O3 concentration was reached at 4 h, the maximum FEV1 decrement (10.2%) was observed at 6 h of exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7310."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hazucha", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seal", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maximal Midexpiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1456565", "10.1164/ajrccm/146.6.1487"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
