The melting of snow covers of between 5- and 15-cm thickness, depending on age and heterogeneity, could increase B. subtilis spore inactivation by up to an order of magnitude, a relative increase twice that caused by a 50% ozone depletion. Within the snow-pack at depths of less than approximately 3 cm snow algae could receive two to three times the DNA-weighted irradiance they would receive on bare ground. At the edge of the snow-pack, warming of low albedo soils resulted in the formation of overhangs that provided transient UV protection to thawed and growing microbial communities on the soils underneath. In shallow aquatic habitats, thin layers of heterogeneous ice of a few millimetres thickness were found to reduce DNA-weighted irradiances by up to 55% compared to full-sky values with equivalent DNA-weighted diffuse attenuation coefficients (K(DNA)) of >200 m(-1). A 2-mm snow-encrusted ice cover on a pond was equivalent to 10 cm of ice on a perennially ice covered lake. Ice covers also had the effect of stabilizing the UV exposure, which was often subject to rapid variations of up to 33% of the mean value caused by wind-rippling of the water surface. These data show that changing ice and snow covers cause relative changes in microbial UV exposure at least as great as those caused by changing ozone column abundance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "British Antarctic Survey, High Cross, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0ET, UK. csco@bas.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cockell", "ForeName": "Charles S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rettberg", "ForeName": "Petra", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horneck", "ForeName": "Gerda", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wynn-Williams", "ForeName": "David D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scherer", "ForeName": "Kerstin", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gugg-Helminger", "ForeName": "Anton", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ice"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Snow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12208033", "10.1016/s1011-1344(02)00327-5", "S1011134402003275"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
