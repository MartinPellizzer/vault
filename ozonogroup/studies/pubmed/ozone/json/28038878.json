Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 estimate were used to assess yearly average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone at the household addresses of participants. Cox regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cause-specific mortality, controlling for demographic and other TB-related factors.", "There were 4444 eligible subjects, including 891 deaths, over a median follow-up of 2464days. Per an interquartile range increase (2.06\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), multivariable analysis indicated that exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> was significantly associated with overall mortality (aHR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.42), mortality from TB (aHR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.85), respiratory cancers (aHR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.36, 2.19), other respiratory diseases (aHR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.38), and other cancers (aHR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.32).", "Long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> increases the risk of death from TB and other diseases among TB patients.
