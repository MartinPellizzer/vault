The results indicated that the MLR model constructed using meteorological parameters from individual months in autumn better simulated the variation in MDA8-O<sub>3</sub> compared to that in the model built using meteorological parameters from the entire autumn season. The combined influence of total cloud cover, relative humidity, 2 m maximum temperature, and 850 hPa zonal wind led to a reduction of 34.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in MAD8-O<sub>3</sub> in 2020 compared to that in 2019, with contributions of 31.3%, 45.2%, 15.8%, and 6.7%, respectively. The observed trends of MDA8-O<sub>3</sub> in the PRD for September, October, November, and the autumn season during 2015-2022 were 7.3, 5.2, 4.8, and 5.8 \u03bcg\u00b7\uff08m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a\uff09<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Among these, the trends driven by meteorological factors were 3.6, 2.4, 2.4, and 3.1 \u03bcg\u00b7\uff08m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a\uff09<sup>-1</sup>.
