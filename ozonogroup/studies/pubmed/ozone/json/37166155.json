Organic hydroperoxides (ROOHs) are known to participate in the multiphase chemistry of outdoor aerosols and clouds, suggesting that reactive uptake in condensed grime on indoor surfaces is plausible, particularly in humid homes. Here, the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the deposition velocity (<i>v</i><sub>d</sub>) and reaction probability (<i>\u03b3</i>) of a model ROOH to naturally soiled indoor glass surfaces was investigated; specifically, by using authentic isoprene hydroxy hydroperoxide (1,2-ISOPOOH) as the model compound. Glass was soiled in 3 local homes for 1+ years and characterized. The removal of ISOPOOH by soiled and clean glass was measured under 5-6%, 56-58%, and 83-84% RH conditions using a novel flow reactor designed for indoor surfaces coupled to an iodide chemical ionization high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (I-HR-TOF-CIMS). The <i>v</i><sub>d</sub> and <i>\u03b3</i> increased with increasing RH, ranging from 0.001-0.059 cm s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.4-4.6 (\u00d710<sup>-6</sup>), respectively, on soiled glass surfaces. The <i>v</i><sub>d</sub> and <i>\u03b3</i> ranged from only 0.001-0.016 cm s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.1-0.8 (\u00d710<sup>-6</sup>), respectively, across RH conditions on clean glass, demonstrating a greater RH effect on soiled materials than clean. Loss rates calculated under humid conditions to soiled glass (\u223c1-6 h<sup>-1</sup>) were competitive in scale with ventilation rates in typical residences, indicating the importance of surface uptake for indoor ROOH concentrations. This work provides parameters for predictive modeling of indoor ROOHs. To our knowledge, these are the first direct measurements of the <i>v</i><sub>d</sub> of an ROOH to naturally soiled indoor surfaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1311-4325"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. bjturpin@email.unc.edu."}], "LastName": "Webb", "ForeName": "Marc", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. bjturpin@email.unc.edu."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Liyong", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. bjturpin@email.unc.edu."}], "LastName": "Morrison", "ForeName": "Glenn", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. bjturpin@email.unc.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Baumann", "ForeName": "Karsten", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6833-1450"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. bjturpin@email.unc.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Surratt", "ForeName": "Jason D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. bjturpin@email.unc.edu."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhenfa", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Atkin", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4513-4187"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. bjturpin@email.unc.edu."}], "LastName": "Turpin", "ForeName": "Barbara J", "Initials": "BJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37166155", "10.1039/d3em00041a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
