Nitrogen was supplied to the plants by adding (15)N-labelled tracer substances via the soil substrate. Enzyme activities (NADH nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase and NADH glutamate dehydrogenase) and the incorporation of (15)N were determined. The findings show that nitrogen metabolism was affected by O(3), however, there were distinct differences between the two species. In plants treated with O(3), NADH nitrate reductase activity in maize leaves was reduced, while NR activity in wheat leaves only slightly declined. Only minor changes were observed with respect to the activities of nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase and NADH glutamate dehydrogenase. Feeding experiments using (15)NO(3) (-) showed that the incorporation of nitrate nitrogen in wheat plants exposed to ozone remains virtually unchanged, whereas in maize plants reduced incorporation rates were observed for nitrate nitrogen. The incorporation of ammonium nitrogen was distinctly increased in wheat and maize by the impact of ozone. When investigating pigment contents, reduced levels of chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids were observed, whereas the pigment content of wheat leaves remained unchanged. These results indicate that young maize plants are more susceptible than wheat plants to short-term ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a    Institut f\u00fcr Biochemie der Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg   ,  Halle ,    Deutschland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00f6cker", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hofmann", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bender", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weigel", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Isotopes Environ Health Stud", "NlmUniqueID": "9602611", "ISSNLinking": "1025-6016"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22088109", "10.1080/10256019608036310"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
