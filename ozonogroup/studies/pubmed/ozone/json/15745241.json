The findings from the partial correlation analysis on the controlling of age suggested that with a prolonged duration of exposure to photochemical smog the values of VC, VE, SOD, and GPX, except for CAT, in the WOs were decreased gradually (P < 0.05-0.005), the value of LPO in the WOs was increased gradually (P < 0.001), and that with the ozone dose increased in the air in each worksite VC, VE, SOD, CAT and GPX decreased (P < 0.005-0.001), but LPO increased (P < 0.001). The findings from the reliability analysis for the VC, VE, SOD, CAT, GPX, and LPO values which were used to reflect oxidative stress and potential oxidative damage in the WOs showed that the reliability coefficients' alpha (6 items) was 0.8021, P < 0.0001, and that the standardized item alpha was 0.9577, P < 0.0001.", "Findings in the present study suggest that there exists an oxidative stress induced by long-term exposure to photochemical smog in the bodies of WOs, thereby causing potential oxidative and lipoperoxidative damages in their bodies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinhua Municipal People's Hospital, 228 Xinhua Street, Jinhua 321000, Zhejiang, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "You-Gen", "Initials": "YG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jun-Fu", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Wei-Ying", "Initials": "WY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Pei-Su", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Gui-Zhong", "Initials": "GZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Environ Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8909524", "ISSNLinking": "0895-3988"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15745241"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
