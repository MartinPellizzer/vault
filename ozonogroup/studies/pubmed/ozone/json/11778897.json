Because bioavailability of the contaminants is of great importance for a successful bioremediation, a chemical pre-oxidation step by ozone was tested to enhance the subsequent biodegradation steps. Oxidation of PAH by ozone should result in reaction products that have a better solubility in water and thus a better bioavailability. A major part of this work was done by examinations of the model substance phenanthrene as a typical compound of PAH. After initial ozonation of phenanthrene, analysis by GC-MS showed at least seven identified conversion-products of phenanthrene. In comparison with phenanthrene these conversion products were more efficiently biodegraded by Sphingomonas yanoikuyae or mixed cultures when the ozonation process resulted in monoaromatic compounds. Primary ozonation products with biphenylic structures were found not to be biodegradable. Investigations into the toxicity of contaminated and ozonated soils were carried out by well-established toxicity assays using Bacillus subtilis and garden cress. The ozonated soils surprisingly showed higher toxic or inhibitory effects towards different organisms than the phenanthrene or PAH itself. The microbial degradation of phenanthrene in slurry reactors by S. yanoikuyae was not enhanced significantly by preozonation of the contaminated soil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Technische Chemie, Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stehr", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Svensson", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamnerdpetch", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scheper", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "448J8E5BST", "NameOfSubstance": "phenanthrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sphingomonas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11778897", "10.1007/s00253-001-0840-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
