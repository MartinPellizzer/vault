This study assessed and compared the efficiencies of ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>) and ozone with hydrogen peroxide (O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 70 OMPs elimination, inactivation of three bacteria and three viruses, and formation of bromate and biodegradable organics during the bench-scale O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of municipal wastewater effluent. 39 OMPs were fully eliminated, and 22 OMPs were considerably eliminated (54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014%) at an ozone dosage of 0.5 gO<sub>3</sub>/gDOC for their high reactivity to ozone or <sup>\u2022</sup>OH. The chemical kinetics approach accurately predicted the OMP elimination levels based on the rate constants and exposures of ozone and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, where the quantum chemical calculation and group contribution method successfully predicted the ozone and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH rate constants, respectively. Microbial inactivation levels increased with increasing ozone dosage up to \u223c3.1 (bacteria) and \u223c2.6 (virus) log<sub>10</sub> reductions at 0.7 gO<sub>3</sub>/gDOC. O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> minimized bromate formation but significantly decreased bacteria/virus inactivation, whereas its impact on OMP elimination was insignificant. Ozonation produced biodegradable organics that were removed by a post-biodegradation treatment, achieving up to 24% DOM mineralization. These results can be useful for optimizing O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processes for enhanced wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
