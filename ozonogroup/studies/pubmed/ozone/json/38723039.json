Such low activities are normally caused by sparse reactive sites and insufficient capacity for molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) activation. Here, we present a dual-stimulation strategy to tackle these two issues. Specifically, we import highly dispersed nickel (Ni) atoms onto MnO<sub>2</sub> to enrich its oxygen vacancies (reactive sites). Then, we use molecular ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) with a lower activation energy as an oxidant instead of molecular O<sub>2</sub>. With such dual stimulations, the constructed O<sub>3</sub>-Ni/MnO<sub>2</sub> catalytic system shows boosted room-temperature activity for toluene oxidation with a toluene conversion of up to 98%, compared with the O<sub>3</sub>-MnO<sub>2</sub> (Ni-free) system with only 50% conversion and the inactive O<sub>2</sub>-Ni/MnO<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-free) system. This leap realizes efficient room-temperature catalytic oxidation of transition metal oxides, which is constantly pursued but has always been difficult to truly achieve."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Prevention and Control, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, P.
