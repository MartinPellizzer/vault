However, the impacts of short-term emission reductions on the air qualities in southern Chinese cities in spring has not been fully explored. We analyzed the changes in air quality in Shenzhen, Guangdong before, during, and after a city-wide lockdown associated with COVID-19 control during March 14 to 20, 2022. Stable weather conditions prevailed before and during the lockdown, such that local air pollution was strongly affected by local emissions. In-situ measurements and WRF-GC simulations over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) both showed that, due to reductions in traffic emissions during the lockdown, the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), respirable particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), and fine particulate matters (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in Shenzhen decreased by (-26\u00b19.5)%, (-28\u00b16.4)%, and (-20\u00b18.2)%, respectively. However, surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration did not change significantly[(-1.0\u00b16.5)%]. TROPOMI satellite observations of formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide column concentrations indicated that the ozone photochemistry in the PRD in spring 2022 was mainly controlled by the volatile organic compound (VOCs) concentrations and was not sensitive to the reduction in nitrogen oxide (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) concentrations. Reduction in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> may even have increased O<sub>3,</sub> because the titration of O<sub>3</sub> by NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> was weakened. Due to the small spatial-temporal extent of emission reductions, the air quality effects caused by this short-term urban-scale lockdown were weaker than the air quality effects across China during the widespread COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Future air quality management in South China cities should consider the impacts of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission reduction on ozone and focus on the co-reduction scenarios of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center of Guangdong Province, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chan-Fang", "Initials": "CF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ao-Xing", "Initials": "AX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center of Guangdong Province, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center of Guangdong Province, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yu-Jing", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen National Climate Observatory, Shenzhen 518040, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Hong-Long", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jiong-Kai", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wen-Lu", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Jia-Jia", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Tzung-May", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Disease Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37309931", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205313"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
