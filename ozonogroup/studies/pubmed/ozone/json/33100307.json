The nanocarbon film consisted of nanocrystallites with mixed sp<sup>2</sup> and sp<sup>3</sup> bonds formed by unbalanced magnetron sputtering. Ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>) irradiation and electrochemical pretreatment (ECP) were conducted to change the surface oxygen concentration of nanocarbon film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that nanocarbon films with different amounts of surface oxygen could be prepared. In addition, we observed no significant increase of the surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) at the angstrom level after treatments, owing to a stable structure containing 40% of sp<sup>3</sup> bonds. The electrode characteristics, including the potential window and electrochemical properties for some redox species, such as Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+/2+</sup>, were investigated. Some electrochemical measurements of zinc ions (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) showed that the electrochemical reaction was improved by suppressing the surface oxygen. These results clearly indicated that the low surface oxygen concentration plays an important role in these electrochemical reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nitto Denko Corporation."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materials and Chemical Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology."}], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "Mitsunobu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health and Medical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)."}], "LastName": "Kamata", "ForeName": "Tomoyuki", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nitto Denko Corporation."}], "LastName": "Haishi", "ForeName": "Motoki", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health and Medical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)."}], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "Dai", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materials and Chemical Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology."}], "LastName": "Hara", "ForeName": "Masahiko", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Anal Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8511078", "ISSNLinking": "0910-6340"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33100307", "10.2116/analsci.20P315"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
