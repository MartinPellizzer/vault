The structure and physicochemical properties of FMSACs and their catalytic ozonation performance on the removal of p-chlorobenzoic acid (p-CBA) were investigated. The saturation magnetization (Ms) of FMSACs was determined in the range of 0.3674-5.7992\u00a0emu\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>, and experiments confirmed that these FMSACs could be easily separated by magnetic fields. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that magnetite and maghemite were the main magnetic phases in FMSACs. Comparing with ozonation alone and SAC catalytic ozonation, the presence of 2.3\u00a0wt% - FMSAC improved the degradation of p-CBA during catalytic ozonation from 44 and 70 to 80%. The tertiary butanol inhibition experiment indicated that FMSACs catalytic ozonation process followed hydroxyl radical reaction mechanism. Furthermore, after six repetitive catalytic ozonation runs, 2.3\u00a0wt% - FMSAC still showed relatively high catalytic activity for the removal of p-CBA. Consequently, the novel FMSACs with magnetic separation ability and catalytic performance provide a practical pathway for the sludge utilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
