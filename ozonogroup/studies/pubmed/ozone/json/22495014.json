The current review summarizes the use of ultrasound with biochemical, electrochemical, ozonation, photolysis, photocatalysis and Fenton processes for the degradation of mostly textile dyes and dyebath. There is a few studies about ultrasonic degradation of textile effluents or wastewater due to highly variable contents. It was found that the most common use of ultrasonic irradiation for dye degradation is the combined with the heterogeneous catalysts/adsorbents. The reaction mechanism of the ultrasonic irradiation in heterogeneous media was well investigated and understood. However, there is still lack of information about the reaction mechanism of ultrasonic irradiation in the homogeneous solutions, especially containing ferrous ions. Fenton reaction is already fast itself and gives effective degradation during the oxidation. Therefore, addition of ultrasonic irradiation to Fenton oxidation was less effective compared to other auxiliary processes. It should also be noted that ultrasonic irradiation had a negative effect on dye degradation during combined with electro-oxidation process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
