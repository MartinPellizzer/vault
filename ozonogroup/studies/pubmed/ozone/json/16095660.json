Percentage removals of oxalic acid were 1.8%, 7% and 30% corresponding to the non-catalytic, homogeneous (Fe(III)) and heterogeneous (Fe2O3/Al2O3) catalytic ozonations, respectively. Catalytic oxalic acid ozonation leads in all cases to total mineralization. The mechanism of ozonation likely develops through formation of iron-oxalate complexes that further react with ozone without the participation of hydroxyl radicals. Because of the stringent acidic conditions, some metal leaching has been observed and quantified in the heterogeneous process. In the homogeneous catalysis, the kinetics was found to be first order with respect to ozone and oxalic acid while for the heterogeneous catalysis, the kinetic order depends on the concentration of ozone in the gas fed. Thus, at ozone concentrations lower than 30 mg L(-1), the heterogeneous ozonation is between first and zero order with respect to both ozone and oxalic acid while at higher ozone gas concentrations, the kinetics was found to be first and zero order with respect to oxalic acid and ozone, respectively. This kinetics is supported through an Eley-Rideal mechanism that involves a surface reaction between non-adsorbed ozone and adsorbed oxalic acid. Apparent activation energies of the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonations were found to be 18.2 and 13.6 kcal mol(-1), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Energ\u00e9tica.
