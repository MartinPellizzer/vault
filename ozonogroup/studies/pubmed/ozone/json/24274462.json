In this study, we present the first interannual comparison of SO2 emissions and the satellite SO2 observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for Indian coal-fired power plants during the OMI era of 2005-2012. A detailed unit-based inventory is developed for the Indian coal-fired power sector, and results show that its SO2 emissions increased dramatically by 71% during 2005-2012. Using the oversampling technique, yearly high-resolution OMI maps for the whole domain of India are created, and they reveal a continuous increase in SO2 columns over India. Power plant regions with annual SO2 emissions greater than 50 Gg year(-1) produce statistically significant OMI signals, and a high correlation (R = 0.93) is found between SO2 emissions and OMI-observed SO2 burdens. Contrary to the decreasing trend of national mean SO2 concentrations reported by the Indian Government, both the total OMI-observed SO2 and annual average SO2 concentrations in coal-fired power plant regions increased by >60% during 2005-2012, implying the air quality monitoring network needs to be optimized to reflect the true SO2 situation in India."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Decision and Information Sciences Division, Argonne National Laboratory , Argonne, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Zifeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Streets", "ForeName": "David G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Foy", "ForeName": "Benjamin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krotkov", "ForeName": "Nickolay A", "Initials": "NA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24274462", "10.1021/es4039648"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
