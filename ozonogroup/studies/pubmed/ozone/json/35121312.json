The results showed that the trichlorfon content in natural and waxed apples decreased by 85% and 64%, respectively, during storage. The morphology of the surface film was dense and regular, which resulted in a higher water vapor resistance and a lower respiration rate in the waxed apples. This indicates that waxing affected the dissipation of pesticide residues in the apple storage environment, increasing food safety risk. Ozone was used to remove the residual pesticides on the apple surface. The trichlorfon degradation rate reached 73%. The ozone treatment had no effect on the surface color of the apple, which means that the fruit can be pre-treated with ozone prior to waxing or storage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
