A conceptual model of O<sub>3</sub> air pollution is developed based on the analysis of data obtained at Tung Chung (TC) in Hong Kong. By comparing meteorological parameters between O<sub>3</sub> and non-O<sub>3</sub> episode days, it was found that high temperatures, strong solar radiation, low wind speeds and relative humidity, northeasterly and/or northwesterly prevailing winds were favorable for the O<sub>3</sub> formation, while tropical cyclones were most conducive to the occurrence of O<sub>3</sub> episodes. Backward trajectories simulation and graphical illustration of O<sub>3</sub> pollution suggested that super-regional (i.e. central and eastern China) and regional (i.e. Pearl River Delta, southern China) transport was another factor that contributed to high O<sub>3</sub> levels in Hong Kong. The photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation, generally VOC-limited in Hong Kong, was controlled by a small number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Furthermore, the positive matrix factorization (PMF) simulation suggested that solvent usage and vehicular emissions are the major contributors to ambient VOCs in Hong Kong. Finally, this paper presents recommendations for further O<sub>3</sub> research and implementation of O<sub>3</sub> control strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
