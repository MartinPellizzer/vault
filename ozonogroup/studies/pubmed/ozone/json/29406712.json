Recent studies have proposed several \"new\" reactive nitrogen chemical processes, including additional sources of nitrous acid, heterogeneous uptake of dinitrogen pentoxide, and production of nitryl chloride. These processes significantly affect the budgets of radicals and NO <sub>x</sub> and hence the formation of ozone. In present study, we aim to investigate to what extent these processes alter the relationships between ozone and its precursors. A revised Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry incorporating the \"new\" nitrogen chemistry was adopted to simulate the ozone sensitivity regime in China in summer. The results showed that nitrogen chemistry changed the ozone sensitivity regime for approximately 40% of the simulated area with human influence, mostly from VOC-sensitive or NO <sub>x</sub>-sensitive regimes to mixed-sensitive regime. The nitrogen chemistry changed the isopleth plots of the ozone peak values for major cities, suggesting a different strategy for controlling ozone pollution. This study underscores the need to consider unconventional nitrogen chemistry in air quality models used in the design of ozone control strategies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong 999077 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5146-5831"], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qinyi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong 999077 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong 999077 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong 999077 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong 999077 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2993-0522"], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Earth System Science , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29406712", "10.1021/acs.est.7b05771"]}}]}
