Nanocellulose is produced from biomass materials by bleaching pretreatment, followed by acid hydrolysis. This work demonstrated the production of NC from recycled paper sludge (RPS), a crystalline cellulose rich waste, by ozonation pretreatment, followed by maleic acid hydrolysis. Ozonation resulted in removal of lignin (as evident by TGA analysis), negative zeta potential of RPS and enhanced NC production, from 60\u2009mg/L to over 80\u2009mg/L after 60-120\u2009min of ozone treatment. Maleic acid was successfully recovered, although longer ozonation times reduced the amount of acid available for recovery. These results demonstrate that ozonation can be used as an effective pretreatment for NC production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
