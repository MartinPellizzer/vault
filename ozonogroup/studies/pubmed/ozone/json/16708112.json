The observed variability in the wavelength scale is two orders of magnitude larger than caused by temperature changes in the instrument. These wavelength variations are the result of rapid changes in time in the radiance levels during an individual observation in the presence of clouds or snow and ice. We have developed a data processing method to account and correct for these changes. In February 2005 this correction was implemented in the official data processing stream. We explain in detail how and how accurately this method works. Before correction, the error in the wavelength scale can be as much as a few tenths of a pixel; after correction it is mostly less than 1/100th of a pixel, which is the required preflight accuracy. This means that higher-level products such as the total column amounts of ozone, NO2, and SO2 are not significantly affected. It is expected that these wavelength variations will be observed in other hyperspectral Earth observation spectrometers and that the correction mechanism should apply equally well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KNMI/Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, AE De Bilt, The Netherlands. voors@knmi.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Voors", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobber", "ForeName": "Marcel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dirksen", "ForeName": "Ruud", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Levelt", "ForeName": "Pieternel", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16708112", "10.1364/ao.45.003652", "89865"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
