The most highly touted \"hyperoxygenating\" agents are hydrogen peroxide, germanium sesquioxide, and ozone. Although these compounds have been the subject of legitimate research, there is little or no evidence that they are effective for the treatment of any serious disease, and each has demonstrated potential for harm. Therefore, the American Cancer Society recommends that individuals with cancer not seek treatment from individuals promoting any form of hyperoxygenation therapy as an \"alternative\" to proven medical modalities."]}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "CA Cancer J Clin", "NlmUniqueID": "0370647", "ISSNLinking": "0007-9235"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00072J7XWS", "NameOfSubstance": "Germanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Germanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8422605", "10.3322/canjclin.43.1.47"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
