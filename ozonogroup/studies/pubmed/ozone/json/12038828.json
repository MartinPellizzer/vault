Samples of four carpets were exposed to 100 ppb ozone. Emission rates of aldehydes and other organic compounds were measured from exposed and unexposed samples. Surface interactions of ozone with carpets produced C1-C13 n-aldehydes and several unsaturated aldehydes. Total aldehyde emission rates increased markedly with ozone exposure, from 1 to 70 microg m(-2) h(-1) for unexposed samples, to 60-800 microg m(-2) h(-1) during exposure. One exposed sample emitted large amounts of 2-nonenal (180-230 microg m(-2) h(-1)), a compound with a low odor threshold. Material balance modeling of a residence with this high emitting carpet suggests (1) that the concentration of 2-nonenal would be well above its odor threshold even in areas with only moderate ambient ozone levels and (2) that odorous levels of 2-nonenal could persist for years. Reactions of ozone with gas-phase primary emissions from carpet significantly reduced the levels of 4-phenylcyclohexene and produced small amounts of branched ketones. Separately measured patterns of aldehyde emissions from ozone exposure of linseed and tung oils were similar but not identical to those observed from ozone-exposed carpets."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley 94720-1710, USA. gcm@umr.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morrison", "ForeName": "Glenn C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nazaroff", "ForeName": "William W", "Initials": "WW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Floors and Floorcoverings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12038828", "10.1021/es0113089"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
