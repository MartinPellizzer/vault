However, as with any implanted object, healthcare-associated infections are not completely avoidable. The material suffers from a lack of biocompatibility and is often subject to bacterial/microbial infections characterized by biofilm growth. Numerous strategies have been developed to either prevent, reduce, or fight bacterial adhesion by providing an antibacterial property. The present review summarizes the diverse approaches to deal with bacterial infections on silicone surfaces along with the different methods to activate/oxidize the surface before any surface modifications. It includes antibacterial coatings with antibiotics or nanoparticles, covalent attachment of active bacterial molecules like peptides or polymers. Regarding silicone surfaces, the activation step is essential to render the surface reactive for any further modifications using energy sources (plasma, UV, ozone) or chemicals (acid solutions, sol-gel strategies, chemical vapor deposition). Meanwhile, corresponding work on breast silicone prosthesis is discussed. The latter is currently in the line of sight for causing severe capsular contractures. Specifically, to that end, besides chemical modifications, the antibacterial effect can also be achieved by physical surface modifications by adjusting the surface roughness and topography for instance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
