This study aimed to evaluate for the first time the interactive effects of high (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> load and elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels on cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) under field conditions. Cauliflower seedlings were treated with 0 (AS0) or 50 (AS50)\u202fkg\u202fha<sup>-1</sup> (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and exposed to ambient (AOZ, \u224820\u202fppb) or elevated (EOZ, \u224855\u202fppb) O<sub>3</sub> for about one month, in a Free Air O<sub>3</sub> Concentration Enrichment (FACE) system. The oligophagous diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella Linnaeus, 1758) showed a clear preference towards the seedlings treated with AS50, which intensively grazed. Plant-herbivore interactions were driven by (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> availability, rather than O<sub>3</sub>, via increased nitrogen content in the leaves. Further laboratory bioassays were followed to confirm the validity of these observations using polyphagous Eri silkmoth larvae (Samia ricini) as a biological model in a standardized experimental setup. Choice assays, where larvae could select leaves among leaf samples from the different experimental conditions, and no-choice assays, where larvae could graze leaves from just one experimental condition, were conducted. In the choice assay, the larvae preferred AS50-treated leaves, in agreement with the field observations with diamondback moth. In the no-choice assay, larval body mass growth was inhibited when fed with leaves treated with EOZ and/or AS50. Larvae fed with AS50-treated leaves displayed increased mortality. These observations coincide with higher NO<sub>3</sub> and Zn content in AS50-treated leaves. This study shows that plant-herbivore interactions can be driven by (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> availability, independently of O<sub>3</sub>, and suggests that high N deposition may have severe health implications in animals consuming such plant tissues. Key message: Plant-herbivore interactions are driven by high (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> availability, independently of O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
