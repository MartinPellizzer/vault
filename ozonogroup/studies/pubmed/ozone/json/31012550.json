In the strive for the best kinetic parameters of biological organisms without a possibility of modifying physicochemical and biochemical reactions in the mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondria can be provided with a substrate that increases energy production efficiency and the amount of ATP. Physicochemical parameters of oleic MFA has become the standard of an oxidation substrate for in vivo energy production; this MFA was synthesized in organisms for millions of years. Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological, energy and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis. This abuse is the major cause of metabolic pandemias in human population. They are: insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, obesity and nonalcoholic liver disease. The most effective measures preventing metabolic pandemias, cardiac heart disease and myocardial infarction are extremely simple. People should remain herbivorous."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Medical Research Center for Cardiology Ministry of Health, 121552, Moscow, Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Titov", "ForeName": "V N", "Initials": "VN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics, 119334, Moscow, Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sazhina", "ForeName": "N N", "Initials": "NN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics, 119334, Moscow, Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evteeva", "ForeName": "N \u041c", "Initials": "N\u041c"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Klin Lab Diagn", "NlmUniqueID": "9432021", "ISSNLinking": "0869-2084"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2V16EO95H1", "NameOfSubstance": "Palmitic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, Vegetarian"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Palmitic Acid"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31012550", "10.18821/0869-2084-2019-64-3-132-139"]}}]}
