An ecological study compared the 41 days of the Olympic Games (8 August-17 September 2008) to a baseline period (1-30 June). Also, in order to emphasize the impact of weather conditions on air quality, a pollution linking meteorological index (Plam) was introduced to represent the air pollution meteorological condition. Our study showed that the average number of outpatient visits for asthma was 12.5 per day at baseline and 7.3 per day during the Olympics-a 41.6% overall decrease. Compared with the baseline, the Games were associated with a significant reduction in asthma visits (RR 0.58, 95%CI: 0.52-0.65). At 16.5 visits per day, asthma visits were also significantly higher, during the pre-Olympic period (RR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.15-1.52). The study also showed that the RR of asthma events on a given day, as well as the average daily peak ozone concentration during the preceding 48-72 h, increased at cumulative ozone concentrations of 70 to 100 ppb and 100 ppb or more compared with ozone concentrations of less than 70 ppb (P\u2009<\u20090.05). We concluded that along with \"good\" weather conditions, efforts to reduce traffic congestion in Beijing during the Olympic Games were associated with a prolonged reduction in air pollution and significantly lower rates of adult asthma events. These data provide support for efforts to reduce air pollution and improve health via reductions in motor vehicle traffic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmosphere Watch and Services, Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jizhi", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoling", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Weili", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuanqin", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biometeorol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374716", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "history", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "history", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Sports"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "JAMA. 2001 Feb 21;285(7):897-905", "ArticleIdList": ["11180733"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2005 Nov 1;350(1-3):225-37", "ArticleIdList": ["16227082"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 2006 Aug 26;368(9537):719-20", "ArticleIdList": ["16938905"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2009 Jun 15;407(13):4004-11", "ArticleIdList": ["19375151"]}, {"Citation": "J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2009 Mar;123(3):596-602, 602.e1-8", "ArticleIdList": ["19281908"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1999 Feb;80(2 Pt 1):110-21", "ArticleIdList": ["10092402"]}, {"Citation": "Eur Respir J. 1998 Oct;12(4):900-5", "ArticleIdList": ["9817166"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 2002 Feb 2;359(9304):386-91", "ArticleIdList": ["11844508"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Exp Allergy. 2007 Sep;37(9):1312-9", "ArticleIdList": ["17845411"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21076997", "10.1007/s00484-010-0373-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
