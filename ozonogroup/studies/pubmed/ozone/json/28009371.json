To assess the ability of spectroradiometers to accurately measure solar ultraviolet irradiance, and to compare the results between instruments of different monitoring networks, the second North American Intercomparison of Ultraviolet Monitoring Spectroradiometers was held June 12 to 23, 1995 at Table Mountain outside Boulder, Colorado, USA. This Intercomparison was coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Participating agencies were the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Science Foundation; the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; the Department of Agriculture; and the Atmospheric Environment Service, Canada. Instruments were characterized for wavelength uncertainty, bandwidth, stray-light rejection, and spectral irradiance responsivity, the latter with a NIST standard lamp operating in a specially designed field calibration unit. The spectral irradiance responsivity, determined once indoors and twice outdoors, demonstrated that while the responsivities changed upon moving the instruments, they were relatively stable when the instruments remained outdoors. Synchronized spectral scans of the solar irradiance were performed over several days. Using the spectral irradiance responsivities determined with the NIST standard lamp and three different convolution functions to account for the different bandwidths of the instruments, the measured solar irradiances generally agreed to within 3 %."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Early", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Ambler", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Carol", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, R/E/ARx1, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80303 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeLuisi", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, R/E/ARx1, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80303 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Disterhoft", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Environment Service, Environment Canada, 4905 Dufferin Street, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wardle", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Environment Service, Environment Canada, 4905 Dufferin Street, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Edmund", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mou", "ForeName": "Wanfeng", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yongchen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biospherical Instruments Inc., 5340 Riley Street, San Diego, CA 92110-2621 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lucas", "ForeName": "Timothy", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biospherical Instruments Inc., 5340 Riley Street, San Diego, CA 92110-2621 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mestechkina", "ForeName": "Tanya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, State University of New York Albany, 100 Fuller RD, Albany, NY 12205 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harrison", "ForeName": "Lee", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, State University of New York Albany, 100 Fuller RD, Albany, NY 12205 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berndt", "ForeName": "Jerry", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Smithsonian Environmental Research Center of the Smithsonian Institution, P.O.
