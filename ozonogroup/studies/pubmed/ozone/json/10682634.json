Mice were exposed to 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/m3 of O3, respectively for 8 h per day for 3 days. Cilia in brochia, Lipid peroxide (LPO) in lung tissue and phagocytic function of macrophage in mice were examined. The results showed that there were cilia damage in the 1.0 mg/m3 group and swelling of mitochondrias as well as endoplasmic reticulums in the 0.25 mg/m3 group. But no damage was found in the group of 0.1 mg/m3. Furthermore, phagocytic rates in the 0.25 and 1.0 mg/m3 groups were significantly lower than that of control group (P < 0.01). No differences in LPO leads were found."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Yan Jiu", "NlmUniqueID": "9426367", "ISSNLinking": "1000-8020"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cilia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10682634"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
