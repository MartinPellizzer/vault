A hexacopter uncrewed aerial vehicle equipped with miniature monitors was employed to measure the vertical distribution of atmospheric pollutants within a height of 1000 m at a rural site in Xi'an, China, in 2021. The concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) showed generally decreasing trends with increasing height. The ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration showed a general increasing trend with height followed by a gradual decreasing trend. Vertical decrements of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CO from 0 to 1000 m were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) lower on observation days during summer (14.0 \u00b1 8.1 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> and 8.7 \u00b1 6.6 ppb, respectively), compared with those in winter (78.3 \u00b1 14.1 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> and 34.8 \u00b1 17.3 ppb, respectively). The horizontal transport of PM and CO mostly occurred in the morning and at night during winter observations at an altitude of 400-500 m. During the winter haze, the PM and CO profile concentrations below 500 m increased substantially with the decrease in the height of the thermal inversion layer. Vertical O<sub>3</sub> transportation was observed in the afternoon and evening during summer, and a \u223c37.7% (11.6 ppb) increase in ground-level O<sub>3</sub> was observed in relation to vertical transport from the upper atmosphere. The results provide insights into the vertical distribution and transport of atmospheric pollutants in rural areas near cities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier":
