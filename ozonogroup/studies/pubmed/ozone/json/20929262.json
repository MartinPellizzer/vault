Yet, they are degraded upon ozonation to some extent, and this is due to (\u2022)OH radicals generated in the reaction of ozone with organic matter in wastewater (DOM, determined as DOC). The elimination of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and tris-2-chloroisopropyl phosphate (TCPP), added to wastewater in trace amounts, was studied as a function of the ozone dose and found to follow first-order kinetics. TnBP and TCPP concentrations are halved at ozone to DOC ratios of \u223c0.25 and \u223c1.0, respectively. The (\u2022)OH rate constant of TCPP was estimated at (7 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) by pulse radiolysis. Addition of 1 mg H(2)O(2)/L for increasing the (\u2022)OH yield had very little effect. This is due to the low rate of reaction of H(2)O(2) with ozone at wastewater conditions (pH 8) that competes unfavorably with the reaction of ozone with wastewater DOC. Simulations based on the reported (N\u00f6the et al., ES&T 2009, 43, 5990-5995) (\u2022)OH yield (13%) and (\u2022)OH scavenger capacity of wastewater (3.2 \u00d7 10(4) (mgC/L)(-1) s(-1)) confirm the experimental data. Based on a typically applied molar ratio of ozone and H(2)O(2) of 2, the contribution of H(2)O(2) addition on the (\u2022)OH yield is shown to become important only at high ozone doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University Duisburg-Essen, Universit\u00e4tsstr. 5, 45141 Essen, Germany. pablopocos@unex.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pocostales", "ForeName": "J Pablo", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sein", "ForeName": "Myint M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knolle", "ForeName": "Wolfgang", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Sonntag", "ForeName": "Clemens", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "Torsten C", "Initials": "TC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20929262", "10.1021/es1018288"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
