Due to the special design of most MIS instruments autoclaving (i.e. application of heat) may damage these delicate items. Therefore, low temperature sterilisation processes are essential. Gas sterilisation with ethylene oxide and formaldehyde may pose significant health hazards to workers exposed to these gases and to patients due to residues remaining on the surface of the instruments. Their general use in hospitals is more and more discouraged. However, with the advent of hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilisation there is a true alternative available for the sterilisation of MIS instruments. In contrast, the use of immersion sterilants such as liquid glutaraldehyde or peracetic acid cannot be considered as adequate because it is almost impossible to keep the processed instruments sterile until their intended use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Hygiene, University of Heidelberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geiss", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Endosc Surg Allied Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9412631", "ISSNLinking": "0942-6027"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JJH7GNN18P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endoscopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Instruments"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Procedures, Operative"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7866764"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
