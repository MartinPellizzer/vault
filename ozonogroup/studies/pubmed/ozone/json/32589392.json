The presence of vegetation itself modifies the physical boundary, or the biogeophysical aspects of the system, by controlling important climate drivers such as soil moisture, light environment, and temperature. The leaf surface area of the terrestrial biosphere provides additional surface area for emissions, and it can be up to 55% of the total Earth's surface area during the boreal summer. Vegetation also influences the biogeochemical aspects of the system by emitting a broad suite of reactive trace gases such as biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions and climate-relevant primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP). Many of these emissions are a function of meteorological and climatological conditions at the surface, including temperature, light environment, soil moisture, and winds. Once emitted, they can be processed in the troposphere through a suite of chemical reactions. BVOC can contribute to the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA), and PBAP can rupture to form smaller particles with climatic relevance. These emissions and subsequent aerosol products can influence atmospheric processes that affect the surface climate, such as the attenuation of radiation, the formation of greenhouse gases such as ozone that can feedback to surface air temperature, and the alteration of clouds and subsequent precipitation. These atmospheric changes can then feedback to the land surface and emissions themselves, creating positive or negative feedback loops that can dampen or amplify the emission response. For the dominant BVOC isoprene, the feedback response to temperature can be positive or negative depending on ambient temperatures that drive isoprene emissions. The feedback response to soil moisture and precipitation can be positive, negative, or uncoupled depending on the moisture content of the soil and the total atmospheric aerosol loading. For light, the isoprene response can be positive or negative depending on the role of diffuse light. Overall, these feedbacks highlight the dynamical response of the biosphere to changing atmospheric conditions across a range of time scales, from minutes for trace gases and aerosols, to months for phenological changes, to years for land cover and land use change. The dynamic aspect of this system requires us to understand, simulate, and predict the complex feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere and understand their role in the simulation and understanding of climate and global change. From the observational perspective, these feedbacks are challenging to identify in observations, and predictive modeling tools provide a crucial link for understanding how these feedbacks will change under warming climate scenarios."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3823-1512"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2143, United States."}], "LastName": "Steiner", "ForeName": "Allison L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acc Chem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0157313", "ISSNLinking": "0001-4842"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32589392", "10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00116"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
