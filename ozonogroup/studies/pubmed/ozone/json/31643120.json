The assessment of the treatment efficiency regarding the removal of organic matter was measured by the excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra. There was a superior efficiency in reducing the formation of DBPs and their precursors by different drinking water treatment processes. Though some DBPs such as THMs could be promoted by ozonation, these by-products from ozonation could be degraded by the following BAC filtration process. In addition, the organic matter from the aromaticity, fulvic acid-like, protein, and soluble microbial by-products-like regions could be further degraded by the O<sub>3</sub> -BAC treatment. PRACTITIONER POINTS: A wide variety of DBPs in different drinking water treatment processes was investigated. The treatment efficiency regarding the removal of organic matter was measured. Some DBPs such as THMs and HAAs could be increased by ozonation. The removal percentage of nitrogen precursors and organic carbon would be increased by BAC filtration."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Water Environment Federation."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Qiufeng", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Feilong", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Yunxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0020-4663"], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cong", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fei", "ForeName": "Weicheng", "Initials": "W"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "51578487", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "51778565", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017ZX07201003", "Agency": "National Major Projects for Water Pollution Control and Treatment", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ankarali, H., Demir, N., Kanik, A.
