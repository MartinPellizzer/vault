We studied the effect of low concentrations of ozone (200 micrograms per cubic meter during 3 days) and sulfur dioxide (53 micrograms per cubic meter during 28 days) on translocation of assimilates in 2 year old Douglas firs. The trees were exposed to the pollutants and afterward transferred to a growth chamber adapted to the use of (14)CO(2). Root/soil respiration was measured daily. The results showed a significant decrease of the (14)CO(2) root/soil respiration during the first 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to either ozone or sulfur dioxide. The ultimate level of (14)CO(2) root/soil respiration did not differ significantly, which suggests a recovery of the exposed trees during the first weeks after exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute Ital, P.
