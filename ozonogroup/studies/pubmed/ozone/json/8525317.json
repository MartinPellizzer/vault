In view of the challenge and as water is serving particularly as the choice for other industrial segments, the fast macrobial proliferation in it is of concern, as it is a potential source of endotoxins. Such a risk is inconsistent with the production of items designed for example, for use in surgical procedures in the cardio-vascular field. Thus research was undertaken for the purpose of investigating the possibility of using water as a cleansing agent for components for such products, providing that hydrogen peroxide is added. The work was carried out by inoculating water and peroxide at levels of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 e 1.0 UE/ml. The confirmation was obtained as to the active effectiveness at a 5% concentration of hydrogen peroxide by means of analytical determination using the \"in vitro\" method. The effectiveness of the use of peroxide was investigated on polycarbonate injected parts designed for the manufacture of oxigenators and blood reservoirs and contained with endotoxins. The findings permit one to draw a favorable conclusion regarding the adequacy of the proposed process both biologically as well as regards the removal of impurities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farm\u00e1cia da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Farmac\u00eauticas da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Per\u00f3xido di hidrog\u00eanio como agente despirogenizante de componentes para produlos midico-hospitalares."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Rev Saude Publica", "NlmUniqueID": "0135043", "ISSNLinking": "0034-8910"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment and Supplies, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Materials Management, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8525317", "10.1590/s0034-89101995000100011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
