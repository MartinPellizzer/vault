However, the effects of heat exposure on hypertension and years of life lost (YLL) due to heat remain largely unknown. We conducted a multicenter study in 13 cities in Jiangsu Province, China, to investigate 9727 individuals who died from hypertension during the summer months (May to September) between 2016 and 2017. Meteorological observation data (temperature and rainfall) and air pollutants (fine particulate matter and ozone) were obtained for each decedent by geocoding the residential addresses. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to quantify the association between heat and different types of hypertension and further explore the modification effect of individual and hospital characteristics. Meanwhile, the YLL associated with heat exposure was estimated. Our results show that summer heat exposure shortens the YLL of hypertensive patients by a total of 14,74 years per month. Of these, 77.9% of YLL was mainly due to hypertensive heart disease. YLL due to heat was pronounced for essential hypertension (5.1 years (95% empirical confidence intervals (eCI): 4.1-5.8)), hypertensive heart and renal disease with heart failure (4.4 years (95% eCI: 0.9-5.9)), and hypertensive heart and renal disease (unspecified, 3.5 years (95% eCI: 1.8-4.5)). Moderate heat was associated with a larger YLL than extreme heat. The distance between hospitals and patients and the number of local first-class hospitals can significantly mitigate the adverse effect of heat exposure on longevity. Besides, unmarried people and those under 65 years of age were potentially susceptible groups, with average reduced YLL of 3.5 and 3.9 years, respectively. Our study reveals that heat exposure increases the mortality risk from many types of hypertension and YLL. In the context of climate change, if effective measures are not taken, hot weather may bring a greater burden of disease to hypertension due to premature death."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
