This study investigated the relationship of air pollutant exposure and meteorological factors with depression. The Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort from 2002 to 2013 was analyzed. In total, 25,589 depression participants were 1:4 matched with 102,356 control participants for age, sex, income, and region of residence. Depression was defined based on a diagnosis (ICD-10: F31-33) by a psychiatric physician. Meteorological factors and air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) (ppm), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) (ppm), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) (ppm), carbon monoxide (CO) (ppm), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <10\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) (\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) during the 30\u00a0days and 365\u00a0days before the index date were analyzed for associations with depression using conditional logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age, sex, income, and region of residence. The odds ratios (ORs) for depression were 1.05 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02-1.08) at 365\u00a0days for 1\u00a0h less of sunshine. The ORs for depression were 1.02 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01-1.03) and 1.03 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.00-1.05) at 30\u00a0days and 365\u00a0days for PM<sub>10</sub> (10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), respectively. The ORs for depression were 1.18 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04-1.35) and 1.25 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.07-1.47) at 30\u00a0days and 365\u00a0days for CO (ppm), respectively. In the subgroup analyses, the overall results were consistent. However, statistical significance diminished in the younger, high-income, and urban resident subgroups. Both short- and long-term exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> and CO and a reduced duration of sunshine were related to an increased risk of depression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
