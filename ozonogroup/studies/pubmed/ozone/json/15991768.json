For three of the four cities (for the other the results were positive but not significant), fine particles (measured by nephelometry - bsp) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have a significant impact on cardiovascular admissions (for total cardiac admissions, RR = 1.0856 for a one-unit increase in bsp (10(-4) x m(-1)), RR = 1.0023 for a 1 ppb increase in NO2). For three of the four cities (for the other, the results were negative and significant), fine particles, NO2 and ozone have a significant impact on respiratory admissions (for total elderly respiratory admissions, RR = 1.0552 per 1 unit (10(-4) x m(-1)) increase in bsp, RR = 1.0027 per 1ppb increase in NO2, RR = 10014 per 1 ppb increase in ozone for elderly asthma and COPD admissions).
