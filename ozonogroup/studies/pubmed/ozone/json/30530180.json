In this study, we conducted a time-series study to investigate the acute adverse effect of six criteria ambient air pollutants (fine particulate matter [PM<sub>2.5</sub>], inhalable particulate matter [PM<sub>10</sub>], nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>], sulfur dioxide [SO<sub>2</sub>], ozone [O<sub>3</sub>], and carbon monoxide [CO]) on hospitalization of patients for hypertension in Shijiazhuang, China, from 2013 to 2016. An over-dispersed Poisson generalized addictive model adjusting for weather conditions, day of the week, and long-term and seasonal trends was used. In addition, we evaluated the effect of modification by season, sex, and age. A total of 650,550 hospitalization records were retrieved during the study period. A 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (lag06), PM<sub>10</sub> (lag06), NO<sub>2</sub> (lag03), O<sub>3</sub> (lag6), and CO (lag04) corresponded to 0.56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28-0.83%), 0.31% (95% CI: 0.12-0.50%), 1.18% (95% CI: 0.49-1.87%), 0.40% (95% CI: 0.09-0.71%), and 0.03% (95% CI: 0.01-0.05%) increments in hospitalization of patients for hypertension, respectively. We observed statistically significant associations with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and CO, while positive but insignificant associations with SO<sub>2</sub>. The effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and CO were robust when adjusted for co-pollutants. We found stronger associations in the cool season than in the warm season. Moreover, there were non-significant differences in the associations between air pollution and sex or age group. This study suggests that patients with hypertension had an increased risk of hospital admission when exposed to air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
