It was found that the vast majority of the PAHs was associated with particle diameters less than 1 and 3 microm. A profile comparison of the PAH mixture--using benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) relative abundance ratios (PAH/B[a]P)--for the cascade impactor filters indicated the formation of a sampling artifact. Overall, the PAH stability scale generated in this study agrees with those produced experimentally for ozone and nitrogen dioxides or developed using other in situ measurement techniques. Correlations of the four- to six-ring PAHs with other atmospheric variables suggested that smelter plume conditions and particle characteristics may play a potentially important role in the overall PAH reactivity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a sampling artifact for the four- to six-ring PAHs during in situ high volume sampling under real world conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, 1130 Pine Avenue West, Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada H3A 1A3. eric.sanderson@mail.mcgill.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanderson", "ForeName": "Eric G", "Initials": "EG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farant", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metallurgy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quebec"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selection Bias"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16245837", "10.1021/es0510111"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
