Here, ozone and its related meteorological factors were observed in summer in Shijiazhuang, a city with the most serious ozone pollution on the North China Plain. The forced and free convection boundary layers were classified using ground remote observations. After eliminating the forced convection condition, strong free convection conditions, exhibiting a high boundary layer height, high wind speed, strong turbulence and large-scale free convection velocity, were found to be beneficial for the aggravation of ozone pollution. Combined with the ozone profile detected by a tethered balloon, the ozone chemical budget was calculated using the differences in the column ozone concentrations between the morning and afternoon, and the results confirmed the impact of free convection intensity on ozone pollution. The change in ozone sensitivity from VOCs sensitivity to NOx sensitivity driven by strong free convection was the main reason for the deterioration of ozone pollution. This study clarified the impact of boundary layer meteorology on ozone and its sensitivity and has important practical significance for ozone pollution prevention and early warning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
