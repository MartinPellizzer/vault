The solution plasma technique was featured as an advanced oxidation technique with low secondary pollution and high efficiency. However, the solution plasma technique reported previously could only treat wastewater of less than 200 mL owing to the limited plasma generated by only one pair of electrodes. In this work, multiple pairs of electrodes were installed at the bottom of the reaction vessel to generate plasma for decomposing methylene blue trihydrate (MB) and methyl orange (MO) solutions with a batch amount of 18 L/batch. The solution plasma technique was compared with direct ozonation in decomposition of MB and MO wastewater. A surprising phenomenon is that MO was more readily decomposed than MB by using direct ozonation, whereas the removal of MO was too low, and MB was more readily decomposed than MO by using the solution plasma technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Hanshan Normal University, Guangdong Chaozhou 521041, China E-mail: yunyingwu@hstc.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Long-fei", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yun-ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yun-hai", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamauti", "ForeName": "Siro", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "Nagahiro", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23985525", "10.2166/wst.2013.321"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
