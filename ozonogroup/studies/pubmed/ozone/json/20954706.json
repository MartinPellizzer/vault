Here, we provide experimental evidence for photochemical formation of NO\u2022 in seawater. Photoproduction rates and overall scavenging rate constants were measured by irradiation of surface seawater samples collected from the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. Photoproduction rates of NO\u2022 ranged from 8.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 M s\u207b\u00b9 to 38.8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 M s\u207b\u00b9 and scavenging rate constants were 0.05-0.33 s\u207b\u00b9. The steady state concentrations of NO\u2022 in seawater, which were calculated from the photoproduction rates and scavenging rate constants were in the range 2.4-32 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9 M. Estimation from the scavenging rate constant showed that the NO\u2022 lifetime in seawater was a few seconds. Our results indicate that nitrite photolysis plays a crucial role in the formation of NO\u2022, even though we cannot exclude minor contributions from other sources. Analysis of filtered and unfiltered seawater samples showed no significant difference in NO\u2022 photoformation rates, which suggests a negligible contribution of NO\u2022 produced by photobiological processes. Using an estimated value of the Henry's law constant (kH \u2248 0.0019 M atm\u207b\u00b9), a supersaturation of surface seawater of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude was estimated. On the basis of the average values of the surface seawater concentration and the atmospheric NO\u2022 concentration, a sea-to-air NO\u2022 flux was estimated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Biosphere Science, Department of Environmental Dynamics and Management, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8521, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olasehinde", "ForeName": "Emmanuel F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takeda", "ForeName": "Kazuhiko", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakugawa", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20954706", "10.1021/es101426x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
