Proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) was used to measure VOCs in the Chengdu Plain, Southwestern China. The diurnal variations, photochemical reactivity, O<sub>3</sub> formation potential, and sources were also investigated. The mixing ratios of ten kinds of VOCs (acetaldehyde, acetone, isoprene, Methyl ethyl ketone, Methyl vinyl ketone and Methacrolein, benzene, toluene, styrene, C8 aromatics, and C9 aromatics) were (10.97\u00b14.69)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. The concentrations of OVOCs, aromatic hydrocarbons, and biogenic VOCs were (8.54\u00b13.44)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, (1.53\u00b10.93)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and (0.90\u00b10.32)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, respectively. Isoprene, acetaldehyde, and m-xylene were the top three photochemically active species with the greatest O<sub>3</sub> formation potentials. The dominant three OVOCs species (acetaldehyde, acetone, and MEK) were mainly derived from local biogenic sources and anthropogenic secondary sources, and acetone had a strong regional background level, indicating that pollution in this area is significantly affected by regional transmission. This study deepens the understanding of regional O<sub>3</sub> formation mechanisms in southwest China and provides a basis for the scientifically informed control of O<sub>3</sub> pollution."]},
