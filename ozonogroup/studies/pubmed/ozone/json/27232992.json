The removal of aromatics and naphthenic acids (NAs) was explored by synchronous fluorescence spectra (SFS), ion mobility spectra (IMS), proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H and (13)C NMR), and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC TOF-MS). UV/H2O2 oxidation occurred through radical reaction and photolysis, transforming one-ring, two-ring, and three-ring fluorescing aromatics simultaneously and achieving 42.4% of classical NAs removal at 2.0\u00a0mM H2O2 and 950\u00a0mJ/cm(2) UV dose provided with medium pressure mercury lamp. Ferrate(VI) oxidation exhibited high selectivity, preferentially removing two-ring and three-ring fluorescing aromatics, sulfur-containing NAs (NAs\u00a0+\u00a0S), and NAs with high carbon and high hydrogen deficiency. At 2.0\u00a0mM Fe(VI), 46.7% of classical NAs was removed. Ozonation achieved almost complete removal of fluorescing aromatics, NAs\u00a0+\u00a0S, and classical NAs (NAs with two oxygen atoms) at the dose of 2.0\u00a0mM O3. Both molecular ozone reaction and OH reaction were important pathways in transforming the organics in OSPW as supported by ozonation performance with and without TBA. (1)H NMR analyses further confirmed the removal of aromatics and NAs both qualitatively and quantitatively. All the three oxidation processes reduced the acute toxicity towards Vibrio fischeri and on goldfish primary kidney macrophages (PKMs), with ozonation being the most efficient."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
