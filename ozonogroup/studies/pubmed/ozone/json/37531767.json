However, these results have not been related to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. Thus, the apportioned contributions could not effectively support secondary pollution control development. Source apportionment of the VOCs consumed in forming O<sub>3</sub> and SOA is needed. A consumed VOC source apportionment approach was developed and applied to hourly speciated VOCs data from June to August 2022 measured in Laoshan, Qingdao. Biogenic emissions (56.3%), vehicle emissions (17.2%), and gasoline evaporation (9.37%) were the main sources of consumed VOCs. High consumed VOCs from biogenic emissions mainly occurred during transport from parks to the southwest and northwest of study site. During the O<sub>3</sub> pollution period, biogenic emissions (46.3%), vehicle emissions (24.2%), and gasoline evaporation (14.3%) provided the largest contributions to the consumed VOCs. However, biogenic emissions contribution increased to 57.1% during the non-O<sub>3</sub> pollution period, and vehicle emissions and gasoline evaporation decreased to 16.5% and 9.01%, respectively. Biogenic emissions and the mixed source of combustion sources and solvent use contributed the most to O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation potentials during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution period, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
