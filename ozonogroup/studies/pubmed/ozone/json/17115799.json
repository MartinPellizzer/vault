For this, daily operational TOC measurements from different instruments were applied covering the period from 1997 to 1999. Measurements were gained from space by Earth Probe Satellite, Earth Remote Sensing satellite/Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment and Operational Vertical Sounder and from the ground by Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers for the locations of Hradec Kralove (Czech Republic, 50 degrees N), Nairobi (Kenya, 1 degrees S) and Springbok (Republic of South Africa, 30 degrees S). The values were used as input parameter to model calculations of erythemally effective irradiance and daily radiant exposure. The differences due to the use of TOC from different sources were analyzed with respect to the Ultraviolet Index (UVI). The UVI was introduced as a tool for sun protection and health care. Therefore, it is of special importance to know the restriction of accuracy. As a tool of health care, the maximum uncertainties are of interest and are described in using the 95%-percentile and the maximum differences. This study shows that differences, i.e. uncertainties (95%-percentile) are in the order of 1 UVI. Independently on the location, however, extreme differences may overstep 3 UVI. For the daily dose the 95%-percentile is around 7.5 UVI hours (UVIh) but differences higher than 20 UVIh were also found."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Physics and Biostatistics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. alois.schmalwieser@vu-wien.ac.at"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmalwieser", "ForeName": "Alois W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schauberger", "ForeName": "G\u00fcnther", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erbertseder", "ForeName": "Thilo", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janouch", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coetzee", "ForeName": "Gerrie J R", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weihs", "ForeName": "Philipp", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Czech Republic"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kenya"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photobiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sunburn"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17115799", "10.1562/2006-06-16-RA-931", "2006-06-16-RA-931"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
