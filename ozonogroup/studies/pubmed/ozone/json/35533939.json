This study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of surface concentrations of ozone over entire China and analyzed the influencing factors based on the geographical detector technique. Moreover, the Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the influence of various meteorological factors on ozone concentrations. The results showed that, on the national scale, the daily average O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the cities of China in 2019 was 92.441\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and the nonattainment rate of daily average ozone was 7.98%. However, the ozone nonattainment rate was 33.33% in heavily polluted regions. The highest O<sub>3</sub> concentration was observed in summer, and the lowest was observed in spring. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in cities across the country showed significant spatial distribution characteristics. Among the five pollutants, the highest correlation was observed between O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the lowest was observed between O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. Among the metrological factors, wind speed and solar radiation are the most influencing factors, and showed positive correlation. Moreover, the annual precipitation is negatively correlated with O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentrations. The methods and findings of this paper can be used as an aid for air pollution control programs in different regions for diminishing the risk of exposure to various air pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
