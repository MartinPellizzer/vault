A therapy was performed in form of intravenous infusions of the ozonized physiologic solutions with ozone, concentration 1200 micrograms/l; a therapy course included 8-9 procedures. 68 patients with migraine attacks, followed by the pronounced autonomic changes, that developed in the frequency range from 5-6 times a year to 2-3 times a week were examined. 40 patients formed a study group and 28 individuals control one (in a control group the physiologic solution was used without ozone). The intensity of a headache, the expression of an anxiety, the state of the vessels of the brain and some biochemical indices were determined. Positive dynamics of the disease was 25% higher in the study group than made up a those in the controls (p < 0.05). In 58% of the patients the attacks were absent during 3-5 months after ozone therapy; less intensity of headache was observed after their relapse. Improvements in the patients coincides with changes in biochemical parameters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotov", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Ozonoterapia migreni."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova", "NlmUniqueID": "9712194", "ISSNLinking": "1997-7298"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Migraine Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11247184"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
