However, anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge is severely affected by antibiotics. This review summarizes the effects of different antibiotics on anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, including production of methane and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and discusses the impact of antibiotics on biotransformation processes (solubilization, hydrolysis, acidification, acetogenesis and methanogenesis). Moreover, the effects of different antibiotics on microbial community structure (bacteria and archaea) were determined. Most of the research results showed that antibiotics at environmentally relevant concentrations can reduce biogas production mainly by inhibiting methanogenic processes, that is, methanogenic archaea activity, while a few antibiotics can improve biogas production. Moreover, the combination of multiple environmental concentrations of antibiotics inhibited the efficiency of methane production from sludge anaerobic digestion. In addition, some lab-scale pretreatment methods (e.g., ozone, ultrasonic combined ozone, zero-valent iron, Fe<sup>3+</sup> and magnetite) can promote the performance of anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge inhibited by antibiotics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
