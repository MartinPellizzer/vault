River water was subjected to lab-scale ozonation experiments under different ozone doses (0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0\u00a0mgO<sub>3</sub>/mgC) and contact times (1, 3, 5, 8 and 10\u00a0min). Mixtures of river water with humic acids or wastewaters (sewage wastewater and secondary effluents) at different proportions were also ozonated. Dissolved organic carbon and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon concentrations as well as spectroscopic characteristics (UV absorbance and fluorescence intensities) of different types of dissolved organic matter and possible changes due to the ozonation treatment are presented. River water, humic substances and wastewater exhibited distinct spectroscopic characteristics that could serve for pollution source tracing. Wastewater impacted surface water results in higher formation of carbonyl compounds. However, the formation yield (\u03bcg/mgC) of wastewaters was lower than that of surface water possibly due to different composition of wastewater derived organic matter and the presence of scavengers, which may limit the oxidative efficiency of ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
