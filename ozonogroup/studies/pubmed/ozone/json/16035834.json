The surfaces are calculated using the complete active space self consistent field method followed by contracted multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations. A slightly reduced augmented correlation consistent valence triple-zeta orbital basis set is used. The ground and excited state energies of the molecule have been computed at 9282 separate nuclear geometries. Cuts through the potential energy surfaces, which pass through the geometry of the minimum of the ground electronic state, show several closely avoided crossings. Close examination, and higher level calculations, very strongly suggests that some of these seemingly avoided crossings are in fact associated with non-symmetry related conical intersections. Diabatic potential energy and transition dipole moment surfaces are created from the computed ab initio adiabatic MRCI energies and transition dipole moments. The transition dipole moment connecting the ground electronic state to the diabatic B state surface is by far the strongest. Vibrational-rotational wavefunctions and energies are computed using the ground electronic state. The energy level separations compare well with experimentally determined values. The ground vibrational state wavefunction is then used, together with the diabatic B<--X transition dipole moment surface, to form an initial wavepacket. The analysis of the time-dependent quantum dynamics of this wavepacket provides the total and partial photodissociation cross sections for the system. Both the total absorption cross section and the predicted product quantum state distributions compare well with experimental observations. A discussion is also given as to how the observed alternation in product diatom rotational state populations might be explained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Chemistry, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TS, United Kingdom. ezinvi_baloitcha@cipma.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balo\u00eftcha", "ForeName": "Ezinvi", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balint-Kurti", "ForeName": "Gabriel G", "Initials": "GG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Chem Phys. 2008 Feb 28;128(8):089901"}, {"RefSource": "J Chem Phys. 2007 Jun 28;126(24):247101; author reply 247102. doi: 10.1063/1.2745797", "PMID": "17614595"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16035834", "10.1063/1.1903947"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
