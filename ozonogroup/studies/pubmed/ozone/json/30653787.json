However, now we are faced with a downturn, which seems to be the result of environmental issues. This paradigm is paralleled with reduced human fertility, decreased sperm quality, increased premature ovarian failure, and diminished ovarian reserve syndromes. Endocrine disruptor chemicals\u00a0and other toxic chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, plasticizers, to mention a few, are a rising concern in today's environment. Some of these are commonly used in the domestic setting: cleaning material and cosmetics and they have a known impact on epigenesis and imprinting via perturbation of methylation processes. Pollution from polyaromatic hydrocarbons, particulate matter <10 and <2.5\u2009\u03bcm, and ozone released into the air, all affect fertility. Poor food processing management is a source of DNA adduct formation, which impairs the quality of gametes. An important concern is the nanoparticles that are present in food and are thought to induce oxidative stress. Now is the time to take a step backward. Global management of the environment and food production is required urgently to protect the fertility of future generations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scientific Consultant Assited Reproductive Technology, Laboratoire Clement, Paris, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scientific Consultant Assited Reproductive Technology, London Fertility Associates, London, UK."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6861-8905"], "LastName": "Menezo", "ForeName": "Yves", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Head of the ART and Genetic Program, Clinica Villa del Sole, Napoli, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dale", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scientific Consultant, Bourn Hall Clinic, Cambridge, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elder", "ForeName": "Kay", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Reprod Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "8903333", "ISSNLinking": "1040-452X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryonic Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epigenesis, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Germ Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30653787", "10.1002/mrd.23116"]}}]}
