Here, we investigated the characteristics and sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at three sampling sites in Zhanjiang. We analyzed 101 VOCs using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/hydrogen ion flame detector (GC-MS/FID) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Summa canister and DNPH adsorption tube. We calculated the ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs and used the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model for source apportionment. The results showed that the mean <i>\u03c6</i>(TVOCs) was 1.28\u00d710<sup>-7</sup>, and the dominant contributors were OVOCs (52%), followed by alkanes (36%), alkenes (7%), halogenated hydrocarbons (2.42%), aromatic hydrocarbons (1.61%), and alkynes (0.78%). The diurnal variation in VOCs was influenced by photochemical reactions; the ratio of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes was high in the morning and evening and low at noon, whereas OVOCs had a low ratio in the morning and noon and high in the evening, influenced by primary emissions and the upwind transport of pollutants. The OFP was 3.28\u00d710<sup>-7</sup>, and the dominant species were formaldehyde, butene, <i>n</i>-butane, butanone, and acetaldehyde.The analysis of X/E values (characterizing the aging degree of air masses) and backward trajectories of air masses showed that during the sampling, when influenced by air masses from the south or southwest, X/E was small, and the aging degree of air masses was high, indicating the influence of regional transport; when influenced by air masses from the east or southeast direction, X/E was large, and the air masses were fresh, and VOCs were mainly from local emissions. Six emission sources of VOCs, including industrial emissions, gasoline vehicle exhaust and gasoline evaporation, regional background and transport sources, biomass combustion, diesel vehicles and marine shipping emissions, and solvent use emission sources, were resolved using the PMF model, with contributions of 36.05%, 28.99%, 13.84%, 10.13%, 7.05%, and 3.95%, respectively.Zhanjiang should strengthen the supervision of formaldehyde, butene, n-butane and butanone, industry sources, and mobile sources as the focus of control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Die", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lai-Guo", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources, Environment and Materials, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Song-Jun", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37177921", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
