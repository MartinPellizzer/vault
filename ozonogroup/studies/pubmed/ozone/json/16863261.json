These isotropic undulations have a characteristic wavelength, lambda approximately 3H, where H is the film thickness. We present here technique of ordering, aligning, and modulating these micro-labyrinth structures by using a patterned stamp, by varying the stamp-film inter-surface distance, by a lateral confinement of the instability and even by a simple shear motion of a flat stamp. Many complex structures, such as an array of femto-liter beakers and doubly periodic channels, are generated from a simple stamp consisting of parallel channels. The elastic nature of the patterns allows an in-situ tuning, manipulation, and reconfiguration of the microstructures. Regardless of their precise morphology, the structures continue to have the elastic length scale, lambda approximately 3H. The structures can also be made permanent as required by UV-ozone-induced oxidation of the structures. The underlying principles of the elastic contact instability presented here have the potential to develop into a new soft lithography technique-elastic contact lithography (ECL), allowing a simple, rapid and large area patterning of soft solids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur-208016, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonuguntla", "ForeName": "Manoj", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ashutosh", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Rabibrata", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subramanian", "ForeName": "Subash A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16863261", "10.1021/la0600696"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
