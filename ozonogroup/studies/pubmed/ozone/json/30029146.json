Therefore, pilot-scale parallel performance comparisons of spent and regenerated GAC, along with a range of pre-oxidant ozone doses, were used to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the removal of various types of treatment byproduct precursors and trace organic compounds. It was confirmed from this pilot-study that ozone alone can effectively degrade chlorinated trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) precursors, chloramine-reactive N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors, and 29 PPCPs. In contrast, biodegradation by microbial population on spent or regenerated GAC can remove NDMA and 22 PPCPs, while the adsorption by regenerated GAC can remove chlorinated THM and HAA precursors, PFAS, flame retardants, and 27 PPCPs. The results of this pilot study are intended to provide those interested in potable reuse with an example of the simultaneous removal capabilities and mechanisms that can be anticipated for treating a complex mixture of organics present in real municipal wastewater effluent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
