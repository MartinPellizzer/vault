The oxidation of 4 with dimethyldioxirane gave a 7:1 isomeric mixture of 5,6-di-tert-butyl-2,3,7-trithiabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene 2-endo-7-endo-dioxide (5a) and 2-exo-7-endo-dioxide (5b) quantitatively. The thermally labile 5 was shown to undergo a retro-Diels-Alder reaction that produces S(2)O and 3 in a reversible way. The resulting S(2)O was trapped by Diels-Alder reactions with dienes to give 3,6-dihydro-1,2-dithiin 1-oxides in good yields. In the absence of the dienes, S(2)O disproportionates to SO(2) and S(3), and the resulting S(3) underwent a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with 3 on its syn-pi-face with respect to the S[double bond]O bond to give a trithiolane derivative, whereas in the presence of excess norbornene, it produced the 1,3-dipolar cycloadduct with norbornene in good yield. Thus, the retro-Diels-Alder reaction of 5 functions as an S(2)O and S(3) source. DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df,2p) level were carried out in order to explain why S(2)O disproportionates to SO(2) and S(3) and why S(2)O acts as a dienophile and not a 1,3-dipole, whereas O(3) and S(3) serve as 1,3-dipoles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Saitama University, Sakura-ku, Saitama, Saitama 338-8570, Japan. nakaj@post.saitama-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakayama", "ForeName": "Juzo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aoki", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takayama", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Akira", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sugihara", "ForeName": "Yoshiaki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "Akihiko", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15264842", "10.1021/ja047729i"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
