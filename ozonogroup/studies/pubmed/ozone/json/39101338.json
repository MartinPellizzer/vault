Therefore, this study aimed to assess the pattern of itching in adults with atopic dermatitis using questionnaires to assess for a circadian rhythm of itching in participating patients at a single institution (n\u2009=\u2009241). A self-report questionnaire was used to assess circadian rhythm and intensity of itching in patients. In addition, the patients' disease severity (Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI]) and quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]) were assessed. Itching occurred most frequently (74.69%) and with the greatest severity (62.66%) between 20:00 and 00:00, and the least number of patients (25.31%) experienced itching between 04:00 and 08:00. The DLQI and EASI scores both correlated with the average and maximum itch intensity (r\u2009=\u20090.582, r\u2009=\u20090.533, respectively; r\u2009=\u20090.539, r\u2009=\u20090.517, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The DLQI and EASI scores were associated with average itch intensity (B\u2009=\u20090.179, B\u2009=\u20090.204, respectively; 95% CI: 0.112 to 0.246, 95% CI: 0.096 to 0.313, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and the EASI score was associated with males and family history (B\u2009=\u20090.285, B\u2009=\u20090.287, respectively; 95% CI: 0.094 to 0.476, 95% CI: 0.096 to 0.478, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.003).
