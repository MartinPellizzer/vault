The whole ashing procedure, including sample transfer, carbonization and oxidation of the sample, dissolution of ash, constant volume control, and homogenization of the solution, was automatically controlled. Gold-plated infrared tubes were used to produce and focus infrared radiation to heat the sample. Ozone was used to accelerate the carbonization of samples at a lower temperature to avoid the production of large amounts of empyreumatic oil. In addition, the self-designed double-layer tube serves as a site for ashing and carbonization of the sample and as a container for dissolving ash, as well as for holding the solution. This is the only container in the entire system to reduce the risk of pollution. Eight biological certified reference materials were used as examples to evaluate the performance of the proposed device. A sample ashing pretreatment cycle, from solid sample to liquid solution, took only 40 min and simultaneously treated 12 samples. Except for individual results, the relative errors between the certified values and recorded values for 38 micro and trace elements, including Ca, Mg, Na, P, Li, Be, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Mo, Ag, Cs, Ba, Tl, Th, U, and rare earth elements, were typically less than 30%. The relative standard deviations for five determinations were typically less than 15%. Graphical abstract Automated dry ashing sample preparation system.
