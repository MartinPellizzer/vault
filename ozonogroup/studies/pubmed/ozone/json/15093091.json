Eleven sites located in the mixed conifer forest near ambient ozone monitoring sites were evaluated annually for 4 years. Four other sites in the San Bernardino Mountains were evaluated for 1 year. Analyses showed OII to be functionally equivalent (r2 = 0.96) to the FPM, and to depend only on fascicle retention and chlorotic mottle (R2 = 0.95) of the fourth whorl (or if four whorls are not present at the site, then the last whorl present for the majority of trees). Significant associations were found between OII and 4-year 24-h. summer SUM0, SUM06, W126 and HRS80 ozone indices. Three sites had higher levels of cumulative chlorotic mottle for individual whorls and larger numbers of trees with visible crown injury than other sites with similar cumulative ambient ozone levels. Including an indicator variable to discriminate between these two groups of sites increased R2 and decreased root mean square (RMSE) for all indices, especially SUM0 (R2 = 0.93, RMSE reduced by 46%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Riverside Fire Laboratory, Pacific Southwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 4955 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside CA, USA. marbaugh@deltanet.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arbaugh", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carroll", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Procter", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093091", "10.1016/s0269-7491(98)00027-x", "S0269-7491(98)00027-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
