Recently, liver-related illnesses have been reported from industries handling HCFC-123. However, information on worker exposure to the material is limited, and an acceptable sampling/analytical method is not available. The aim of this study was to develop a widely applicable sampling and analytical method to determine worker exposures to airborne HCFC-123 and to evaluate the performance of the method. A solid sorbent tube, containing two sections (400 mg in the front and 200 mg in the back) of activated coconut-shell charcoal was chosen for sampling airborne HCFC-123 vapor. The breakthrough volumes were 13.6 L at 3597 +/- 210.1 ppm (with a sampling airflow rate of 0.046 L/min) and 17.0 L at 1841 +/- 4.5 ppm (with sampling airflow rate of 0.046-0.050 L/min). Samples of HCFC-123 in the charcoal tube were stable for 7 days either at room temperature or in a refrigerator and a migration occurred within 14 days at room temperature. It is recommended that the HCFC-123 sample in activated charcoal tubes be stored either at room temperature or in a refrigerator and be analyzed within 7 days. The HCFC-123 in the charcoal tubes was desorbed into dichloromethane and analyzed using gas chromatography/ flame ionization detection. The limit of detection was 0.23 mg/sample, and the average desorption efficiency was 99.0%. The total coefficient of variation was 0.060, and the method accuracy was 16.6%. In conclusion, the performance of the sampling and analytical method developed for the determination of airborne HCFC-123 concentrations was acceptable to the NIOSH sampling and analytical criteria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Health and Safety, Inje University, 607 Obang-Dong, Gimhae 621-749, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Yong Chul", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Gwang Yong", "Initials": "GY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yangho", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paik", "ForeName": "Nam Won", "Initials": "NW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "AIHA J (Fairfax, Va)", "NlmUniqueID": "101146781", "ISSNLinking": "1542-8117"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "306-83-2", "NameOfSubstance": "2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sampling Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workplace"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12570079", "10.1080/15428110208984760"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
