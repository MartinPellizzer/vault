Considering the shortage of studies concerning the treatment of landfill leachates using ozone, as well as its combination with catalysts, the aim of this paper was to identify the organic compounds in this effluent treated with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) of ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>), and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation with TiO<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>) and with ZnO (O<sub>3</sub>/ZnO). In addition, this study sought to assess the efficiency of the removal of the organic matter present in the leachate. For the pre- and post-AOPs, the leachate was characterized through physicochemical parameters and identification of organic compounds using gas chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The three processes studied (O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>/ZnO) presented color removal, turbidity, BOD above 95%, and lower COD removals (19%, 24%, and 33%, respectively). All AOPs studied promoted a similar reduction of organic compounds from leachate, some of which with toxic and carcinogenic potential, such as p-cresol, bisphenol A, atrazine, and hexazinone. In addition, upon the removal of organic matter and organic compounds, the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation processes proved more efficient than the process carried out only with ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Chemical Engineering , Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1 , Maring\u00e1 , Paran\u00e1 , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scandelai", "ForeName": "Ana Paula Jambers", "Initials": "APJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Chemical Engineering , Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1 , Maring\u00e1 , Paran\u00e1 , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sloboda Rigobello", "ForeName": "Eliane", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Chemical Engineering , Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1 , Maring\u00e1 , Paran\u00e1 , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Beatriz Lopes Corso de", "Initials": "BLC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Chemical Engineering , Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1 , Maring\u00e1 , Paran\u00e1 , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tavares", "ForeName": "C\u00e9lia Regina Granhen", "Initials": "CRG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29160760", "10.1080/09593330.2017.1405079"]}}]}
