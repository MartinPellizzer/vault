For this reason, the disinfection process must be appropriated, eliminating pathogenic microorganisms. Ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>) and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments can be used for effluent disinfection, but few studies just address the Escherichia coli quantification. In this study, secondary effluents from two wastewater treatment plants with different characteristics were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> (5 and 10\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) or UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: 90\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) treatments and evaluated by BD Phoenix \u2122 100 (Becton Dickinson, USA) and MALDI-TOF for the characterization of the indigenous microorganisms in the effluents, before and after treatments. Additionally, all the samples were tested for phytotoxicity by Lactuca sativa bioassay. The results showed that the highest ozone dose and the UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment were effective in removing E. coli. UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was more efficient as it eliminated most of the microorganisms. Acinetobacter sp., Aeromonas and Pseudomonas were still found after O<sub>3</sub> treatment. Bacillus sp. was found after O<sub>3</sub> and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments. The results with L. sativa showed inhibition of root growth for all dry period (low rainfall) samples of one of the WWTP, due to the high concentration of the phytotoxicity compounds. For environmental and human health safety, treated effluents should be evaluated for their toxic and pathogenic potential before being released into the environment. Pathogens evaluation on treated effluents should cover a wider range of pathogenic microorganisms than those routinely required by legislation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
