The reactor is applied to determine ozone disinfection kinetics of poliovirus and to study whether EMA-qPCR can assess the viral infectivity after ozone disinfection.", "Ozone disinfection of poliovirus was conducted in the developed CQF, and the disinfection kinetics were tested in the range of 0\u00b77-5\u00b70\u00a0s at ozone concentration of 0\u00b708 and 0\u00b725\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> . Inactivation, damage on viral genome and damage on capsid integrity were determined by plaque assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and ethidium monoazide treatment coupled with RT-qPCR (EMA-qPCR), respectively.", "By using CQF, 2\u00b718 and 2\u00b776 log<sub>10</sub> reductions were observed at the reaction time of 0\u00b77\u00a0s and ozone concentration of 0\u00b708 and 0\u00b725\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> , respectively, followed by tailing. Ozone disinfection kinetics of poliovirus 1 were better fit by the efficiency factor Hom model than by the Chick-Watson model, or the modified Chick-Watson model. Kinetics observed were similar between RT-qPCR and EMA-qPCR assays at the reaction times of <2\u00b70\u00a0s and ozone concentrations of 0\u00b708 and 0\u00b725\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> . At reaction times >\u00a05\u00a0s, viral concentration evaluated by EMA-qPCR was reduced in comparison to stable RT-qPCR results. Both assays still underestimated the virus inactivation.", "The simple developed reactor can be used to investigate viral ozone disinfection kinetics and to elucidate inactivation characteristics or mechanisms at very short exposure times.", "The developed CQF reactor is beneficial for better understanding of virus inactivation by ozone, and the reactor can be used to better elucidate disinfection kinetics and mechanisms for future research. This work constitutes an important contribution to the existing knowledge of the application and limitation of the EMA/PMA-qPCR to assess virus infectivity after ozone disinfection."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7240-4416"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Sangsanont", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1567-4852"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Water Environment Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kurisu", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Water Environment Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Furumai", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Katayama", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "The Bureau of Waterworks Tokyo Metropolitan Government", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "H28-Kenki-Ippan-005", "Agency": "The Health Labor Sciences Research Grant", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Ministry of Health", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "69498-50-6", "NameOfSubstance": "8-azidoethidium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poliovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Plaque Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Inactivation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "American Public Health Association (1998) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (20th edn).
