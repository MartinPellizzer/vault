The electrical resistance of the hybrid lead mixed halide perovskite (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3-x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub>) sensing element, was immediately decreased when exposed to an ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) environment and manage to recover its pristine electrical conductivity values within few seconds after the complete removal of ozone gas. The sensing measurements showed different response times at different gas concentrations, good repeatability, ultrahigh sensitivity and fast recovery time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a lead halide perovskite semiconductor material is demonstrating its sensing properties in an ozone environment. This work shows the potential of hybrid lead halide based perovskites as reliable sensing elements, serving the objectives of environmental control, with important socioeconomic impact."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5395-7477"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Materials Technology and Photonics & Electrical Engineering Department, School of Applied Technology, Technological Educational Institute (TEI) of Crete Heraklion , 71004 Crete, Greece."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Technology, University of Crete , Heraklion, 71003 Crete, Greece."}], "LastName": "Kakavelakis", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Crete , Department of Physics, 71003 Heraklion, Crete, Greece."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Electronic Structure & Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology (FORTH) Hellas , P.O.
