The association of air pollutant levels with hemoglobin, platelets, red and white blood cells (RBC and WBC, respectively) was determined by multiple linear and logistic regression analyses, after adjustment for age, gender, anthropometric measures, meteorological factors, and dietary and physical activity habits.", "The study participants consisted of 134 students (48.5% boys) with a mean age of 13.10\u00b12.21 years. While the mean Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) was at moderate level, the mean particulate matter \u2264 10 \u00b5m (PM10) was more than twice the normal level. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that PSI and most air pollutants, notably PM10, had significant negative relationship with hemoglobin and RBC count, and positive significant relationship with WBC and platelet counts. The odds ratio of elevated WBC increased as the quartiles of PM10, ozone and PSI increased, however these associations reached significant level only in the highest quartile of PM10 and PSI. The corresponding figures for hemoglobin and RBC were in opposite direction.", "The association of air pollutants with hematologic parameters and a possible pro-inflammatory state is highlighted. The presence of these associations with PM10 in a moderate mean PSI level underscores the necessity to re-examine environmental health policies for the pediatric age group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poursafa", "ForeName": "Parinaz", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelishadi", "ForeName": "Roya", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amini", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amini", "ForeName": "Abasgholi", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amin", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mehdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lahijanzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Modaresi", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "J Pediatr (Rio J)", "NlmUniqueID": "2985188R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-7557"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemoglobins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hemoglobins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21842113", "10.2223/JPED.2115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
