Oxidative delignification is an effective way to increase the enzymatic digestibility of cellulose. In this work, the current research progress on conventional oxidative pretreatment including wet oxidation, alkaline hydrogen peroxide, organic peracids, Fenton oxidation, and ozone oxidation were reviewed. Some recently developed novel technologies for coupling pretreatment and direct biomass-to-electricity conversion with recyclable oxidants were also introduced. The primary mechanism of oxidative pretreatment to enhance cellulose digestibility is delignification, especially in alkaline medium, thus eliminating the physical blocking and non-productive adsorption of enzymes by lignin. However, the cost of oxidative delignification as a pretreatment is still too expensive to be applied at large scale at present. Efforts should be made particularly to reduce the cost of oxidants, or explore valuable products to obtain more revenue."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
