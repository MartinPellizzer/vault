However, little is known about the response of soil NO<sub>y</sub> (HONO + NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions and microbial functional genes to the interaction of climate warming and plant invasion. Here, we found that experimental warming (approximately 1.5 \u00b0C), but not Spartina alterniflora invasion, increased NO<sub>y</sub> emissions (0-140 ng N m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) of treated wetland soils by 4-10 fold. Warming also decreased soil archaeal and fungal richness and diversity, shifted their community structure (e.g., decreased the archaeal classes Thermoplasmata and Iainarchaeia, and increased the archaeal genus Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum, and the fungal classes Saccharomycetes and Tritirachiomycetes), and decreased the overall abundance of soil N cycling genes. Structural equation modeling revealed that warming-associated changes in edaphic factors and the microbial N cycling potential are responsible for the observed increase in soil NO<sub>y</sub> emissions. Collectively, the results showed that climate warming accelerates soil N cycling by stimulating large soil HONO and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, and influences air quality by contributing to atmospheric reactive N and ozone cycling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
