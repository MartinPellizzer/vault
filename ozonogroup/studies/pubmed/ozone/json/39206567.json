An imbalance between radical observations and simulations has been identified based on radical closure experiments, a valuable tool for accessing the state-of-the-art chemical mechanisms, demonstrating a deviation between the existing and actual tropospheric mechanisms. In the past decades, researchers have attempted to explain this deviation and proposed numerous radical generation mechanisms. However, these newly proposed unclassical radical generation mechanisms have not been systematically reviewed, and previous radical-related reviews dominantly focus on radical measurement instruments and radical observations in extensive field campaigns. Herein, we overview the unclassical generation mechanisms of radicals, mainly focusing on outlining the methodology and results of radical closure experiments worldwide and systematically introducing the mainstream mechanisms of unclassical radical generation, involving the bimolecular reaction of HO<sub>2</sub> and organic peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>), RO<sub>2</sub> isomerization, halogen chemistry, the reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O with O<sub>2</sub> over soot, epoxide formation mechanism, mechanism of electronically excited NO<sub>2</sub> and water, and prompt HO<sub>2</sub> formation in aromatic oxidation. Finally, we highlight the existing gaps in the current studies and suggest possible directions for future research. This review of unclassical radical generation mechanisms will help promote a comprehensive understanding of the latest radical mechanisms and the development of additional new mechanisms to further explain deviations between the existing and actual mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Vehicle Emission Control and Simulation, Vehicle Emission Control Center, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xinping", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xuefei", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3808-1964"], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Zhaofeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9425-9520"], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Keding", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuanhang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "50"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "50"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39206567", "10.1021/acs.est.4c00742"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
