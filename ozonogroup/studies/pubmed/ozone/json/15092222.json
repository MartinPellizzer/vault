Karst, by studies of the uptake of CO(2) by the crowns, the element content, on leaching of the youngest needles, and the longevity of the needles. All plants were exposed to 0.075 microl litre(-1) SO(2) from January to April 1986. The average ozone concentrations applied during the subsequent growing season (May-December) were 0, 0.027, 0.050 and 0.100 microl litre(-1). Half of the trees received liquid fertilizer applications from April to July 1986. CO(2) uptake by the crowns was significantly reduced in non-fertilized plants at ozone doses of 100-200 microl litre(-1) h, whereas similar reductions were recorded in fertilized plants only above an ozone dose of 300 microl litre(-1) h. Independent of the fertilization, however, the concentrations of calcium, magnesium and nitrogen in the needles increased in parallel with the ozone dose, whilst potassium, phosphorus and sulphur showed little response to ozone. In both nutrient regimes, the diffusive loss of elements from chloroform-washed needles was similar and tended to be reduced at the highest ozone concentration, when relating the leachate to the corresponding element content in the needles. Needles formed in the highest ozone treatment were significantly shed during the succeeding year, regardless of the nutrient supply. It appears that increased potassium supply has little compensating effect on ozone stress in spruce."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstr. 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Pollut. 1991;69(2-3):following 267"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092222", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90168-c", "0269-7491(90)90168-C"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
