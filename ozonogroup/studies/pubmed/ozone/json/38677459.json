Thus, understanding GLO pollution trends is crucial for developing effective control strategies, especially Kaohsiung industrial city, Taiwan. Based on the long-term monitoring data set of 2011-2022, temporal analysis reveals that monthly mean GLO peaks in autumn (40.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.10\u00a0ppb), carbon monoxide (CO) and major precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) reach their highest levels in winter. The distinct seasonal variation of air pollutants in Kaohsiung is primarily influenced by the unique blocking effect of the mountainous area under the northeasterly wind, as the city is situated downwind, causing high GLO levels during autumn due to the accumulation of stagnant air hindering the dispersion of pollutants. Over the 12 years (2011-2022), the deseasonalized trend analysis was conducted with p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, revealing a stabilization trend of GLO (+0.04\u00a0ppb/yr) from a previous sharp increase. The observed improvement is credited to a drastic decrease in total oxidants (O<sub>x</sub>) at -0.63\u00a0ppb/yr due to significantly reducing their precursors. Furthermore, the effectiveness of precursor reduction is also supported by GLO daily maximum profile changes. While high GLO events (>120\u00a0ppb) decrease, days within midrange (60-80\u00a0ppb) rise from 24.4% to 33.3%. A notable difference emerges when comparing daytime and nighttime GLO. While daytime GLO decreased at -0.22\u00a0ppb/yr, nighttime GLO increased at +0.34\u00a0ppb/yr. Weakened nocturnal titration effects accounted for the nighttime increase. The distinct spatial variations in GLO trends on a citywide scale underscore that areas with complicated industrial activities may not benefit from a continuing reduction of precursors compared to less-polluted areas. The findings of this study hold significant implications for improving GLO control strategies in heavily industrialized city and provide valuable information to the general public about the current state of GLO pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
