Elemental analysis (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis [ESCA]) of the IOL surfaces was performed to confirm surface modification. Changes produced by UV/O3 or argon plasma treatment were examined for fibronectin and lens epithelial cell (LEC) adhesion. To evaluate the PCO prevention by treated IOLs, 8-week-old albino rabbits were used. The rabbit eyes randomly had phacoemulcification and implantation of 3 different IOLs: the UV/O3-treated IOLs, argon plasma-treated IOLs, and the control IOLs. After 2 weeks, the rabbits were killed and their globes were dissected and fixed using formaldehyde 10%. The PCO was observed using light microscopy (DX51, ORIMPUS) after hematoxylin and eosin staining.", "Comparison of IOL surface composition by ESCA showed an increase in nitrogen content and hydroxyl substitute and carboxyl substitute groups on surfaces of treated IOLs. The fibronectin adhesion and the LEC adhesion on the UV/O3-treated and argon plasma-treated samples were increased. In the untreated group, there was statistically significant inhibition of PCO formation in the UV/O3-treated and argon plasma-treated groups.", "Active oxygen processing and argon plasma irradiation on the surface of IOLs was effective in preventing secondary PCO after cataract surgery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsushima", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwamoto", "ForeName": "Hidetoshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukai", "ForeName": "Kouichiro", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Obara", "ForeName": "Yoshitaka", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cataract Refract Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "8604171", "ISSNLinking": "0886-3350"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coated Materials, Biocompatible"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibronectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cataract"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coated Materials, Biocompatible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Probe Microanalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibronectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lens Capsule, Crystalline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lens Implantation, Intraocular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lenses, Intraocular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phacoemulsification"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Postoperative Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16814067", "10.1016/j.jcrs.2006.02.042", "S0886-3350(06)00232-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
