Exposure to six air pollutants (SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5,</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) at patients` residences and the clinic site were estimated using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method based on data obtained from monitor sites. The daily mean levels of pollutants were estimated in potential exposure windows (the period from three months before treatment to oocyte retrieval, the period of ovarian stimulation, the period of in vitro culture, the period from embryo transfer to hCG test, the period of entire pregnancy, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester) were calculated. Generalized additive models adjusted for confounders including maternal age, BMI, and parity were used to evaluate the association between exposures and birthweight. Interaction of exposures and ART-associated factors, such as supraphysiologic estradiol and frozen-thawed, were explored in an XGboost model.", "Birthweight and z-score of singletons.", "In fresh cycles, O<sub>3</sub> exposure during the period from three months before treatment to oocyte retrieval and SO<sub>2</sub> exposure during in vitro culture at the ART clinic showed a linear association with birthweight (7.24, 95% CI: 1.18-13.31\u00a0g per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O3; 25.92, 95% CI: 8.26-43.58\u00a0g per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in SO<sub>2</sub>, respectively). For patients receiving single blastocyst transfer with exposures below the China standard of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, an increase of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in SO<sub>2</sub> was associated with a 61.52 (95% CI: 1.13-121.91) g increase in birthweight. In FET cycles, no significant association was found between air pollution and birthweight. XGboost model did not reveal a strong interaction between the exposures and ART-related factors, except for the interactions between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and BMI.
