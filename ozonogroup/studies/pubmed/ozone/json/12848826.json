Heynh. mutant lcd1-1 exhibits a pale phenotype compared to the wild type. Confocal and multiphoton microscopy revealed that the paleness of lcd1-1 is because of a lower cell density in the leaf palisade parenchyma, resulting in decreased chlorophyll content. When exposed to ozone, lcd1-1 leaves become paler and contain an increased amount of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde compared to the wild type, suggesting that lcd1-1 suffers from elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the apoplast. Infection of leaves with virulent Pseudomonas syringae reveals higher bacterial growth as well as lower pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1) and PR-5 expression in lcd1-1 than in the wild type. When the wild type and lcd1-1 are exposed to short-term high-light stress, leaves do not bleach in lcd1-1 and potential activities of photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII) decrease to a similar extent in both the genotypes, indicating that the photosynthetic apparatus is not affected by lcd1-1 mutation. The LCD1 gene, found to contain a nonsense mutation in the mutant, has been identified. It is located at the bottom of chromosome 2 of the Arabidopsis genome. However, the function of the protein encoded by LCD1 is not yet known. We hypothesize that LCD1 plays a role in normal leaf development, and that the increased sensitivity to ozone and virulent P. syringae is a secondary effect that presumably results from the lower-cell-density phenotype in lcd1-1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barth", "ForeName": "Carina", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Conklin", "ForeName": "Patricia L", "Initials": "PL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pathogenesis-related proteins, plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Confocal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virulence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12848826", "10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01795.x", "1795"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
