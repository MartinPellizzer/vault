To determine whether adsorption may play a role, adsorption isotherms of N<sub>2</sub>O were constructed at 273\u202fK on outgassed samples of anoxically-prepared wood-derived chars (300-700\u202f\u00b0C) and on a subset briefly reheated in air at 400\u202f\u00b0C. Sorption by the chars was greater and more reversible than sorption by soils or soil mineral phases. Adsorption by chars increased with pyrolysis temperature and upon post-pyrolysis air oxidation. The Langmuir maximum capacity correlates well with the CO<sub>2</sub>-determined (but not N<sub>2</sub>-B.E.T.-determined) surface area. At environmentally realistic partial pressures in soil, N<sub>2</sub>O adsorption correlates with CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, and is found to predominate in the micropores (<1.5\u202fnm), especially ultramicropores (<0.7\u202fnm). Neither adsorption nor adsorption reversibility was affected by coating the char with soil organic matter extract. It is concluded that char added at levels above 1% in soil would act as a strong and reversible sink for N<sub>2</sub>O, and could be responsible for the temporary nature of N<sub>2</sub>O emission suppression observed in some cases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
