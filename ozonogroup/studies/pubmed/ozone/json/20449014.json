These oxygen-rich species were prepared by reactions of laser-evaporated copper atoms with dioxygen or ozone in solid argon. The CuO(5) complex was determined to be a superoxo copper ozonide complex, in which both the superoxo and ozonide ligands are side-on bonded to the copper center. It was predicted to have a (4)A(1) ground state with planar C(2v) symmetry. Besides CuO(5), the previously observed CuO(4) complex and a new CuO(4)(-) anion were also formed. The CuO(4) complex was characterized to be a side-on bonded copper disuperoxide complex, which has a (4)B(2u) ground state with planar D(2h) symmetry. The CuO(4)(-) anion was characterized to be a disuperoxide complex with both superoxide ligands coordinated to the Cu center in an end-on fashion having a (3)A(u) ground state with planar C(2h) symmetry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysts and Innovative Materials, Advanced Materials Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Mingfei", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67XQY1V3KH", "NameOfSubstance": "Argon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Argon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20449014", "10.1039/b909999a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
