Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI) is an important contributor to the viability of flaps after transferring. The goal of this research was for assess the probable useful impacts of ozone on flap survival in a rat muscle-flap design. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> We examined the effects of postconditioning ozone administration on viability of pedicled composite flaps. Twenty-eight Wistar rats were randomized into four groups: sham-operated (S), ischemia-reperfusion (IR), sham-operated\u2009+\u2009ozone (O), IR\u2009+\u2009ozone (IR\u2009+\u2009O), respectively. The animals were sacrificed on the eighth day. In a general histological evaluation, flap tissues were examined with a light microscope, and apoptotic cells were counted. The Apoptotic Index (AI) was then calculated. Flap-tissue samples were sent for analyses of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and protein carbonyl (PCO), and blood samples were sent for analyses of Total Oxidant Score (TOS), and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC). Data were evaluated statistically using the Kruskal-Wallis test. <i>Results:</i> The histomorphometric score was remarkably greater in <b>O</b> (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.002). The AI was greater in <b>IR</b> (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.002). The antioxidant parameters values as regards SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and TAC were found to be greater in <b>O</b> (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.005). The oxidant parameters values as regards MDA, PCO, TOS were found to be greater in <b>IR</b> (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.005). <i>Discussion</i>: The current research indicates that ozone application can attenuate the muscle-flap injury brought about by IR through triggering the increase of the antioxidant capacity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Selcuk University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elsurer", "ForeName": "Cagdas", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Selcuk University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onal", "ForeName": "Merih", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hand Microsurgery, Konya Educational and Training Hospital, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selimoglu", "ForeName": "Nebil", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Selcuk University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erdur", "ForeName": "Omer", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Selcuk University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yilmaz", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Selcuk University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erdogan", "ForeName": "Ender", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Baskent University Medical Faculty Konya Hospital, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kal", "ForeName": "Oznur", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Selcuk University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Celik", "ForeName": "Jale Bengi", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Selcuk University Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onal", "ForeName": "Ozkan", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "8809255", "ISSNLinking": "0894-1939"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Graft Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemic Postconditioning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "blood supply", "pathology", "transplantation"], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Flaps"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30339503", "10.1080/08941939.2018.1473901"]}}]}
