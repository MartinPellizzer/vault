While the influent was continuously ozonated at a normal dosage, preferable organic matter removal was achieved in subsequent MBR, and trans-membrane pressure increased at a much lower rate than that of the individual MBR. EEM fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to characterize the dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) samples and membrane foulants. Four main peaks could be identified from the EEM fluorescence spectra of the DOM samples in both MBRs. Two peaks were associated with the protein-like fluorophores, and the other ones were related to the humic-like fluorophores. The results indicated that pre-ozonation decreased fluorescence intensities of all peaks in the EEM spectra of influent DOM especially for protein-like substances and caused red shifts of all fluorescence peaks to different extents. The peak intensities of the protein-like substances represented by Peak T(1) and T(2) in EPS spectra were obviously decreased as a result of pre-ozonation. Both external and internal fouling could be effectively mitigated by the pre-ozonation. The most primary component of external foulants was humic acid-like substance (Peak C) in the MBR with pre-ozonation and protein-like substance (Peak T(1)) in the individual MBR, respectively. The content decrease of protein-like substances and structural change of humic-like substances were observed in external foulants from EEM fluorescence spectra due to pre-ozonation. However, it could be seen that ozonation resulted in significant reduction of intensities but little location shift of all peaks in EEM fluorescence spectra of internal foulants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
