The inlet NO with a concentration of 200-800 ppm in pure N<sub>2</sub> was mixed with ozone, produced from pure oxygen, and directed to a reactor with catalytic TiO<sub>2</sub> powder. The oxidation of NO by ozone allowed to prepare mixtures with variable concentrations of NO and NO<sub>2</sub> or NO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> which were adsorbed on the catalyst surface during the oxidation phase and were desorbed when only NO was flowing through the reactor. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy studies showed NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> as the main adsorbed nitrogen oxide specimen on the surface. The amount of adsorbed nitrogen oxide species increased with the increasing fraction of NO<sub>2</sub> in the gas phase and was inversely proportional with the gas-phase NO concentration. An important finding was the abrupt increase in the nitrogen oxide adsorption capacity of TiO<sub>2</sub> when the inlet concentration of ozone became sufficiently large to oxidize NO <sub>x</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. On the basis of the results, a model of the surface processes is proposed, involving the production of NO<sub>3</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> on the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physics , University of Tartu , W.
