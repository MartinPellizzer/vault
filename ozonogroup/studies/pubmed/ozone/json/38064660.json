Despite their importance, precise estimation of these emissions remains challenging, impeding the implementation of NMVOC controls. Here, we present the first comprehensive plant-level assessment of NMVOC emissions from the chemical industry in China, encompassing 3461 plants, 127 products, and 50 NMVOC compounds from 2010 to 2019. Our findings revealed that the chemical industry in China emitted a total of 3105 (interquartile range: 1179-8113) Gg of NMVOCs in 2019, with a few specific products accounting for the majority of the emissions. Generally, plants engaged in chemical fibers production or situated in eastern China pose a greater risk to public health due to their higher formation potentials of O<sub>3</sub> and SOA or their proximity to residential areas or both. We demonstrated that targeting these high-risk plants for emission reduction could enhance health benefits by 7-37% per unit of emission reduction on average compared to the current situation. Consequently, this study provides essential insights for developing effective plant-specific NMVOC control strategies within China's chemical industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
