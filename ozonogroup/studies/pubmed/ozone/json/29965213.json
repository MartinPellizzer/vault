The experimental results showed that ARB removal by ultraviolet (UV) disinfection from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was only 18.2%-40.9% and AMP was the highest in content. ERY could be selectively removed by different disinfection technologies; however, there was no distinguished selective removal performance for other four types of ARB (<i>P</i><0.05). For ARB, COD and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N removal, the optimal ozone, chlorination, and UV concentration or dosage were 5.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, 25.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, and 45.0 mJ\u00b7cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, and the corresponding ARB removal efficiencies were 45.5%-74.5%, 66.1%-85.5%, and 68.6%-85.5%. Furthermore, the combined UV and chlorine treatment could achieve better ARB removal performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ya-Lan", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Cen-Xin", "Initials": "CX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "He-Zhou", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Anaerobic Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu College of Water Treatment Technology and Material Collaborative Innovation Center, Suzhou 215009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Anaerobic Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu College of Water Treatment Technology and Material Collaborative Innovation Center, Suzhou 215009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965213", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201612141"]}}]}
