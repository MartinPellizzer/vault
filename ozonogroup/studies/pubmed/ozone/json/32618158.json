An electronic search of publications was established from two electronic databases: PubMed and Web of Science. The search strategy used a combination of controlled vocabulary and freetext words. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined by the authors before the start of the study. The inclusion criteria were: all studies published in English language; studies in vivo on humans; studies analyzing the correlation between PD and OT. The search resulted in 102 titles. Only 9 articles were included in the quantitative analysis. By the analyzed studies a strictly connection is still not evincible. More clinical trials are recommended to investigate the role of ozone, in its various types of topical administration, as a valid subgingival irrigant to achieve the goal of periodontal tissue health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\"-Department of Chemical Science and Technologies, PhD in Materials for Health, Environment and Energy-Dentistry, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Lio", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\"-Department of Clinical Science and Translational Medicine, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ottria", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\"-Department of Clinical Science and Translational Medicine, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mazzetti", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Oral Surgery Specialty School, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Leggeri", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\"-Department of Chemical Science and Technologies, PhD in Materials for Health, Environment and Energy-Dentistry, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Casella", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\"-Department of Chemical Science and Technologies, PhD in Materials for Health, Environment and Energy-Dentistry, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Arcuri", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32618158", "4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
