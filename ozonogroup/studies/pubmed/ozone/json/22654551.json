Patients were randomly allocated to 2 experimental groups consisting of 20 subjects. In the first group, ozone was applied once for 40 seconds to the assigned test teeth of each pair. In the second group, ozone was applied once for 40 seconds to the assigned test teeth of each pair with the use of re-mineralizing solution. Progression or improvement of the caries was assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment and at 1-,2-,3-, and 6 month follow-up by comparing the DIAGNOdent values, Clinical Severity Indexes, Oral Hygiene Scores. The results were analyzed statistically by using the Wilcoxon-Test for dependent samples in each group. When comparing different test groups (control and experimental groups) the Friedman S test followed by the Mann-Whitney U test was used.", "A statistically significant difference was found between all of the control and experimental test lesions in each group (P<.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the ozone treated groups and those using the additional re-mineralizing solution (P>.001).", "Ozone treatment either alone or combined with a re-mineralizing solution was found to be effective for remineralization of initial fissure caries lesions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gazi University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atabek", "ForeName": "Didem", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oztas", "ForeName": "Nurhan", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101303672"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "M\u00fcller P, Guggenheim B, Schmidlin PR.
