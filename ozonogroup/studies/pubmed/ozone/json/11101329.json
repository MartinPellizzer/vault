Lab-scale experiments of both single activated sludge and combined ozone-activated sludge processes were carried out to determine the kinetic coefficients of the biological stage. The results obtained indicated a clear improvement in the kinetic parameters of the aerobic oxidation when a pre-ozonation stage was applied. Particularly, COD removal and nitrification rates were highly increased. The biokinetic parameters were also used to simulate and optimize the continuous reaction system. From the model prediction it was concluded that the integrated process (i.e., ozone-ASP) may significantly increase the waste reduction capacity. The results presented here provide a useful basis for further scaling up and efficient operation of ozone-ASP units in wastewater treatment processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Energ\u00e9tica, Universidad de Extremadura, 06071 Badajoz, Spain. fbeltran@unex.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beltr\u00e1n", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Araya", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11101329", "10.1021/bp000068i", "bp000068i"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
