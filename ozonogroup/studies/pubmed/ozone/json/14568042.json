The objective of this study was to assess the ability of peracetic acid (PAA), UV, or ozone to inactivate the indicator organisms fecal coliforms, Enterococci, MS-2 coliphage, or Clostridium perfringens in the effluent from this plant. PAA doses to reach the target fecal coliform level of 9000 CFU/100mL exceeded 6 mg/L; similar results were obtained for enterococci, and no inactivation of Clostridium perfringens was observed. However a 1-log reduction of MS-2 occurred at PAA doses of 1.5 mg/L and higher. It was expected that this effluent would have a high ozone demand, and would require relatively high UV fluences, because of relatively high effluent COD, iron and suspended solids concentrations, and low UV transmittance. This was confirmed herein. For UV, the inactivation curve for fecal coliforms showed the typical two-stage shape, with the target of 1000 CFU/100 mL (to account for photoreactivation) occurring in the asymptote zone at fluences >20 mJ/cm(2). In contrast, inactivation curves for MS-2 and Clostridium perfringens were linear. Clostridium perfringens was the most resistant organism. For ozone, inactivation was already observed before any residuals could be measured. The transferred ozone doses to reach target fecal coliform levels ( approximately 2-log reduction) were 30-50 mg/L. MS-2 was less resistant, but Clostridium perfringens was more resistant than fecal coliforms. The different behaviour of the four indicator organisms studied, depending on the disinfectant, suggests that a single indicator organism might not be appropriate. The required dose of any of the disinfectants is unlikely to be economically viable, and upstream changes to the plant will be needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada H3A 2K6. ronald.gehr@mcgill.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gehr", "ForeName": "Ronald", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veerasubramanian", "ForeName": "Priya", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Payment", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I6KPI2E1HD", "NameOfSubstance": "Peracetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium perfringens"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Levivirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peracetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14568042", "10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00394-4", "S0043-1354(03)00394-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
