Among them, subjects who had been born (n = 1828) or lived (n = 1894) within 2 km of the nearest air quality monitoring sites were selected. The prevalence of allergic diseases was assessed by using questionnaires. Each subject was examined by pediatricians to determine the presence of eczema. Publicly available data were used regarding the daily ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter.", "For a 100 ppb increase in the mean daily CO level during the first year of life, the adjusted odds ratio for lifetime allergic rhinitis was 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.19). For a 1 ppm increase in the annual average CO level during the past 12 months, the adjusted odds ratio for the presence of atopic dermatitis on the day of the survey was 8.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-62.12).
