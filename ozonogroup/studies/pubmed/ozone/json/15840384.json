Potassium bromate (KBrO(3)) is a by-product from ozonation of high-bromide surface water for production of drinking water and is a rodent carcinogen that produces thyroid, mesothelial, and renal tumors. The proposed mechanism of KBrO(3) renal carcinogenesis involves the formation of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a promutagenic base lesion in DNA typically removed through base excision repair (BER). In this study, male Long-Evans rats were exposed via drinking water to carcinogenic concentrations of KBrO(3) (0.4 g/L), 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (0.07 g/L), chloroform (1.8 g/L), bromodichloromethane (0.7 g/L), or a mixture of all these chemicals at the same concentrations for 3 weeks. Half of one kidney was processed for microscopic examination, and the remaining kidney was frozen for isolation of genomic DNA. Levels of 8-oxoG were measured using HPLC with electrochemical detection in DNA samples incubated with formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase. Aldehydic lesions (e.g. abasic sites) in DNA samples were quantitated using an aldehyde-reactive probe slot-blot assay. Treatment with KBrO(3) produced a measurable increase of 8-oxoG in the kidney, and this effect was greater than that produced by treatment with the DBP mixture. No other single chemical treatment caused measurable increases of 8-oxoG. The mixture effect on the amount of 8-oxoG observed in this study suggests an interaction between chemicals that reduced the generation of oxidative DNA damage. No increases in abasic sites were observed with treatment, but a decrease was apparent in the rats treated with the DBP mixture. These data are consistent with previous studies where chronic exposure to this chemical mixture in drinking water resulted in a less than additive carcinogenic response in Tsc2 mutant Long-Evans rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Curriculum in Toxicology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDorman", "ForeName": "Kevin S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pachkowski", "ForeName": "Brian F", "Initials": "BF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "Douglas C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Swenberg", "ForeName": "James A", "Initials": "JA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES07126", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "0227276", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "04MB35W6ZA", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium bromate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5614-64-2", "NameOfSubstance": "8-hydroxyguanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5Z93L87A1R", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "77439-76-0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7LN464CH2O", "NameOfSubstance": "bromodichloromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V31YC746X", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloroform"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroform"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Guanine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Long-Evans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Mutant Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15840384", "10.1016/j.cbi.2005.02.003", "S0009-2797(05)00041-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
