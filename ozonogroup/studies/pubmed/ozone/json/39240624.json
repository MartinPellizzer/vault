In this context, the role of corticosteroids is well known, but there is still a gap of knowledge on the duty of oxygen-ozone therapy (O2-O3).", "To evaluate for effectiveness of ultrasound-guided O2-O3 injections compared with corticosteroid injections among patients diagnosed with knee OA.", "This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on participants with knee OA who were randomly sorted into two groups: group A, undergoing corticosteroid group (n= 47) and group B, undergoing O2-O3 (n= 49) were injected within the knee joint under ultrasound guidance. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) score between baseline and 12-weeks post-injection. Secondary outcome measures included visual analog scale scores, joint effusion and a knee flexion ROM. Assessments were recorded at baseline and 4-weeks and 12-weeks post-injection. For the examination of intra- and inter-group variations at various time points, a repeated-measure analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was employed.", "Ninety-six participants completed this study. Based on repeated measurement analysis of variance, a significant effect of time was found for all outcome measures in both groups. Both groups showed clinically significant improvements in knee pain, quality of life and, function. Baseline, 4-week post-injection and 12-week post-injection WOMAC scores (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) were 72.54 \u00b1 18.89, 45,95 \u00b1 13.30 and 37.10 \u00b1 19.87 (p= 0.00, p= 0.00, p= 0.00; respectively) in the corticosteroid group, respectively and 68.23 \u00b1 20.18, 42.99 \u00b1 18.67, and 33.43 \u00b1 18.24 (p= 0.00, p= 0.00, p= 0.00; respectively) in the ozone group, respectively.
