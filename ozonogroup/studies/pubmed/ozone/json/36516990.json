Herein, we present measurement results of OOMs using chemical ionization mass spectrometry with nitrate as the reagent ion in Shanghai. Compared to those in forests and laboratory studies, OOMs detected at this urban site were of relatively lower degree of oxygenation. This was attributed to the high NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> concentrations (\u223c44 ppb), which overall showed a suppression on the propagation reactions. As another result, a large fraction of nitrogenous OOMs (75%) was observed, and this fraction further increased to 84% under a high NO/VOC ratio. By applying a novel framework on OOM categorization and supported by VOC measurements, 50 and 32% OOMs were attributed to aromatic and aliphatic precursors, respectively. Furthermore, aromatic OOMs are more oxygenated (effective oxygen number, <i>n</i>O<sub>eff</sub> = 4-6) than aliphatic ones (<i>n</i>O<sub>eff</sub> = 3-4), which can be partly explained by the difference in initiation mechanisms and points to possible discrimination in termination reactions. This study highlights the roles of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> in OOM formation in urban areas, as well as the formation of nitrogenous products that might show discrimination between aromatic and aliphatic VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Centre for Regional Oceans, Faculty of Science
