Treatment of distillery spent-wash used in this research by anaerobic-aerobic biodegradation resulted in overall COD removal of 70.8%. Ozonation of the anaerobically treated distillery spent-wash was carried out as-is (phase I experiments) and after pH reduction and removal of inorganic carbon (phase II experiments). Introduction of the ozonation step resulted in an increase in overall chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, with the highest COD removals of greater than 95% obtained when an ozone dose of approximately 5.3 mg ozone absorbed/mg initial total organic carbon was used. The COD removal during phase II experiments was slightly superior compared with phase I experiments at similar ozone doses. Moreover, efficiency of ozone absorption from the gas phase into distillery spent-wash aliquots was considerably enhanced during phase II experiments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Arun", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saroj", "ForeName": "Devendra P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tare", "ForeName": "Vinod", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bose", "ForeName": "Purnendu", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17120459", "10.2175/106143005x78636"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
