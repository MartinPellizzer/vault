Catalysts with Ag supported on porous cube-like \u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ag/Mn-C) with high utilization of Ag were prepared by the impregnation method and showed excellent O<sub>3</sub> decomposition activity. Physicochemical characterizations demonstrated that metallic Ag nanoparticles (Ag<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>0</sup>) were mainly anchored on manganese vacancies, forming Ag-O-Mn bonds between Ag<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>0</sup> and \u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C. The abundant manganese vacancies of \u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C can lead to Ag<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>0</sup> with a smaller particle size and more uniform dispersion, thereby resulting in markedly enhanced O<sub>3</sub> decomposition performance compared to Ag<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>0</sup> with a large particle size and uneven distribution on rod-like \u03b1-Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ag/Mn-R). Under a relative humidity of 65% and a space velocity of 1,110,000 h<sup>-1</sup>, the conversion of 40 ppm O<sub>3</sub> over the 2%Ag/Mn-C catalyst within 6 h (98%) at 30 \u00b0C was more than twice as high as that of the 2%Ag/Mn-R catalyst (42%). The study provides guidance for the design of highly efficient Ag-based catalysts and the understanding of the microstructure of supported catalysts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3097-2658"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaotong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1770-3522"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Guangzhi", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-0669"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jinzhu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Xufei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yingfa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8476-8217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34751029", "10.1021/acs.est.1c05765"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
