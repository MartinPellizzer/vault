Clarifying the formation mechanisms of O<sub>3</sub> and the sources of its precursors is necessary for the effective prevention of O<sub>3</sub> pollution. In this study, a comparative analysis of O<sub>3</sub> formation mechanisms and VOCs apportionment for five O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes was carried out at two urban sites (CRAES and CGZ) in Beijing in 2019 and 2020 by applying an observation-based modeling approach in order to obtain insights into O<sub>3</sub> pollution control strategies. Results indicated that O<sub>3</sub> pollution levels were generally more severe in 2019 than in 2020 during the observation periods. O<sub>3</sub> formation at the two sites was both VOCs-limited on O<sub>3</sub> polluted days and non-O<sub>3</sub> polluted days. Stronger atmospheric oxidation capacity and ROx radicals cycling processes were found on O<sub>3</sub> polluted days which could accelerate the local production of O<sub>3</sub>, and local photochemical production dominated the observed O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at the two sites even on non-O<sub>3</sub> polluted days. Emission reduction of VOCs should be a priority for mitigating O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and alkenes and biogenic VOCs was the priority species at the CRAES and CGZ sites, respectively. Additionally, the reduction of oxygenated VOCs should also be important for the ozone control. Gasoline exhaust at the CRAES site, and solvent utilization and fuel evaporation at the CGZ site were main anthropogenic sources of VOCs. Therefore, local control measures should be further strengthened and differentiated control strategies of VOCs in the aspects of area, time, sources and species should be adopted in urban Beijing in the future. Overall, the findings of this study could provide a scientific understanding of the causes of O<sub>3</sub> pollution and significant guidelines for formulating O<sub>3</sub> control strategies from the perspective of different ozone pollution episodes in urban Beijing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
