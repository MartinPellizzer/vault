Results revealed the average 5.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>2</sup>\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> of VOCs with the top two groups being aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs, 55.93%) and halogenated hydrocarbons (HHs, 33.33%), contributing to 1.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup> and 3.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>4</sup>\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> of the O<sub>3</sub> and SOA (OFP and SOAFP) formation potential, respectively. Furthermore, 86.47% of OFP and 99.87% of SOAFP were ascribed to AHs, in which toluene ranked first (35.30% and 48.07%). The highest removal efficiency (76.92%) for VOCs by the integrated technique resulted in excellent prevention efficiencies of OFP (71.54%) and SOAFP (80.62%). Occupational cancer risk assessment found that HHs (62.63%) and AHs (36.93%) were the top two contributors. After the treatment by the integrated technique, 55.44% of the total risk index was reduced with the accumulation of few low-concentrated and more toxic AHs (e.g. 6.6\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> benzene on average). All results suggest that controlling AH and HH emissions from the e-waste dismantling source could efficiently prevent atmospheric secondary pollution and human exposure risk to industrial emission."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
