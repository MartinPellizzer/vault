Dye degradation by the combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone (HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>) has caused extensive interest. The degradation mechanism of the hybrid system needs further investigation. This study investigated the degradation of acid red 73 (AR73) by HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. Meanwhile, the degradation pathways and mechanisms were present. The optimal operation parameters were: inlet pressure of 0.15\u00a0MPa, O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 45\u00a0mg/min, initial dye concentration of 10\u00a0mg/L, and initial pH at 7.5. As a result, the decolorization rate, removal of UV<sub>254</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>-N were 100%, 71.28%, and 87.36% in 30\u00a0min, respectively. Humic acid and most of the co-existing anions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) played a positive role in the degradation of AR73, while NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> restrained. The reactive species of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) and super oxygen radicals (\u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) showed synergism in the hybrid system, and the decolorization was attributed to the fracture of azo bonds by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, aromatic amines were generated and further degraded into small molecule compounds. The research certificated that the HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> can be an effective technology for azo dye degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
