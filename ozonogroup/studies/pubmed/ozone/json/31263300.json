The time interval between coronary angiography (CAG) to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is proposed as modifiable risk factor for reduction of CSA-AKI. The aim of this study was to assess influence of time interval between CAG to off-pump CABG (OPCABG) on incidence of CSA-AKI.", "This was a retrospective observational study of 900 consecutive OPCABG patients who were classified into 2 groups based on time interval between CAG and OPCABG: \u22647 days or longer.", "The incidence of CSA-AKI was 24% (214/900) by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. The incidence of CSA-AKI was not significantly different in two groups (22% in >7 days groupvs. 28% in \u22647 days group, <i>P</i> = 0.31). The factors independently associated with CSA-AKI were: Age (OR 1.04; <i>P</i> = 0.002), baseline creatinine (OR 1.99,; <i>P</i> = 0.03), moderate LV dysfunction (OR 1.64,; <i>P</i> = 0.007) and blood transfusion (OR 3.3,; <i>P</i> < 0.001), but not the time interval between CAG and OPCABG. The incidence of CSA-AKI was highest in patients with creatinine clearance (CC) <50 mL/min when OPCABG was performed \u22647 days of CAG (16/38; 42%, OR 2.7, 1.4-5.4; <i>P</i> = 0.005) compared to lowest incidence of CSA-AKI in patients with CC >50 mL/min and OPCABG performed >7 days of CAG (114/543; 21%).", "This study demonstrated that there is no increased incidence of CSA-AKI if OPCABG is performed \u22647 days of CAG; but we recommend to postpone OPCABG for seven days if CC is <50 mL/min and there is no urgent indication for OPCABG in order to reduce incidence of CSA-AKI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borde", "ForeName": "Deepak Prakash", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asegaonkar", "ForeName": "Balaji", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Apsingekar", "ForeName": "Pramod", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khade", "ForeName": "Sujeet", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khodve", "ForeName": "Bapu", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Narayana Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Shreedhar", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Lissie Hospital, Kochi, Kerala, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "Antony", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Surgery, United CIIGMA Hospital, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pujari", "ForeName": "Amey", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Surgery, United CIIGMA Hospital, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deodhar", "ForeName": "Anand", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Anaesth", "NlmUniqueID": "0013243", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5049"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Birch M, Lupei MI, Wall M, Weinkauf J.
