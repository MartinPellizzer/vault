Notably, absorption was significantly facilitated with adding PEG into absorbent. Compared to absorption by sulfite solution alone, NO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiency with PEG addition increased from 58.75% to 89.17%. Furthermore, the favorable role of PEG was considered to be ascribed to the its improvement on the rate-determining step among absorption process \u2500\u2500 mass transfer of NO<sub>2</sub> into the liquid phase. A potential chemical transformation pathway between NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and PEG was proposed, and based on the hydrogen bonding between the various compounds. Additionally, a kinetic model was established based on various operating parameters that included adsorbent pH, ionic strength of S species, temperature, flow rate, and inlet SO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This model provides theoretical support for practical engineering."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
