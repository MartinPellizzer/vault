Here we use measurement-based modeling to show that, unexpectedly, both RIS and RBS can lead to enhanced O<sub>3</sub> formation in a polluted marine environment under volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited conditions associated with high nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>X</sub> = [NO] + [NO<sub>2</sub>]) concentrations. Under these conditions, the daily average O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratio increased to \u223c44 and \u223c28% for BrO and IO mixing ratios of up to \u223c6.8 and 4.7 ppt, respectively. The increase in the level of O<sub>3</sub> was partially induced by enhanced ClNO<sub>3</sub> formation for higher Br<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> emission flux. The increase in the level of O<sub>3</sub> was associated with an increased mixing ratio of hydroperoxyl radical to hydroxyl radical ([HO<sub>2</sub>]/[OH]) and increased [NO<sub>2</sub>]/[NO] with higher levels of RBS and/or RIS. NO<sub>X</sub>-rich conditions are typical of the polluted MBL, near coastlines and ship plumes. Considering that O<sub>3</sub> is toxic to humans, plants, and animals and is a greenhouse gas, our findings call for adequate updating of local and regional air-quality models with the effects of activities of RBS and RIS on O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratios in the polluted MBL."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Department of Soil and Water Sciences, The Robert H.
