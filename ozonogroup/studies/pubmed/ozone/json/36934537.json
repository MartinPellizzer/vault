In engineering applications, Fe shavings were compressed and modified to form Fe-based monolithic catalyst packing. Both of which exhibited excellent catalytic activity in catalytic ozonation industrial wastewater after biochemical treatment. Fe-based monolithic catalyst packing has irregular channels, large porosity, small pore diameter, and the effective specific surface area (SSA) up to 3500 m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>, these characteristics are conducive to mass transfer, and promote the effective utilisation of \u2022OH in the catalyst \"action zone\". A tower reactor (<3000 m<sup>3</sup>/d) and reinforced concrete construction reactor (>5000 m<sup>3</sup>/d) were designed according to the wastewater flow. Regression analysis showed that hydraulic residence time (HRT) and O<sub>3</sub>/COD<sub>in</sub> are important parameters in engineering design and operation. In addition, strategies for the application of Fe-based monolithic catalyst packing to wastewater with high salinity and high inorganic carbon concentration have been proposed. Fe-based monolithic catalyst packing catalytic ozonation is a relatively cost-effective and eco-friendly process with extremely broad application prospects in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
