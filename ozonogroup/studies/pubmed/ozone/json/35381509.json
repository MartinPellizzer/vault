Herein, we found that single-crystal WO<sub>3</sub> nanosheets (NSs)-based photocatalytic ozonation (PCO) can realize complete mineralization of phenols (phenol and 2-chlorophenol) under visible light irradiation. Almost 100% mineralization ratio of phenols was achieved through WO<sub>3</sub> NSs-based PCO system within short time. By comparing their performances with those of polycrystalline WO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, detecting and analyzing the intermediates, identifying the dominant radicals and conducting some electrochemical characterizations, the origin of superior catalytic activity of WO<sub>3</sub> NSs was uncovered, the mineralization pathways and the overall mechanism were proposed. The excellent PCO performance of WO<sub>3</sub> NSs was contributed to their nanosheet morphology with single-crystal microstructure and good dispersion, which can provide continuous interior channels for the photogenerated charge transport from the bulk to surface of WO<sub>3</sub> NSs and enough active sites for the surface reactions triggered by these charges. This work puts forwards new ideas to design highly active photocatalysts for PCO and helps deepen understanding of the catalytic mechanism of PCO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
