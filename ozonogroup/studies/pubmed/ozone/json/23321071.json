Three passenger cars were tested at the ECE and the EUDC drive cycles to represent both urban and suburban driving scenarios. Exhaust gas was collected in Summa canisters and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Common gaseous emissions (CH(4), NOx, CO, and CO(2)) were measured by an on-board monitoring system. The VOC emission factors of different cars ranged from 0.10 to 0.25 g km(-1) at the ECE cycle, and 0.01-0.02 g km(-1) at the EUDC cycle. A total of 57 individual VOC were detected in the exhaust gas, and the weight percentages were very consistent among the three cars. Ethylene (11.80 wt.%), toluene (11.27 wt.%), and benzene (8.83 wt.%) were the most abundant VOC in exhaust gas. Aromatics (38.32%) dominated the low speed conditions (ECE), while alkanes (37.34%) were the major compounds at the high speed condition (EUDC). The total amount of alkenes did not change much between those two cycles, while ethylene is abundant in the ECE and EUDC cycles. Ozone formation potential (OFP) was calculated to estimate the ozone yield from VOC emissions by gasoline cars and the results showed that OFP of VOC emission at the ECE cycle was about ten times higher than that at the EUDC cycle."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.
