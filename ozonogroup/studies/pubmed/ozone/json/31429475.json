This study evaluated the growth of Listeria monocytogenes during sprouting of alfalfa seeds and the effectiveness of daily chlorine dioxide & ozone rinsing in controlling the growth. Alfalfa seeds inoculated with L. monocytogenes were sprouted for 5\u00a0days (25\u00b0C) with a daily aqueous ClO<sub>2</sub> (3\u00a0ppm, 10\u00a0min) or ozone water (2\u00a0ppm, 5\u00a0min) rinse. Neither treatment significantly reduced the growth of L. monocytogenes on sprouting alfalfa seeds. The initial level of L. monocytogenes was 3\u00b744\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b727, which increased to c. 7\u00b70 log CFU per g following 3\u00a0days of sprouting. There was no significant difference in the bacterial population between the treatment schemes. Bacterial distribution in roots (7\u00b763\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b7511 log CFU per g), stems (7\u00b751\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b7511 log CFU per g) and leaves (7\u00b741\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b7511 log CFU per g) were similar after 5\u00a0days. Spent sanitizers had significantly lower levels of bacterial populations compared to the spent distilled water control. The results indicated that sprouting process provides a favourable condition for the growth of L. monocytogenes and the sanitizer treatment alone may not be able to reduce food safety risks. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Sprouts are high-risk foods. Consumption of raw sprouts is frequently associated with foodborne disease outbreaks. Optimum sprouting procedure involves soaking seeds in water followed by daily water rinsing to maintain a moist environment that is also favourable for the growth of pathogenic micro-organisms. The present study emphasized the potential food safety risks during sprouting and the effect of applying daily sanitizer rinsing in the place of water rinsing to reduce those risks. The finding of this study may be useful in the development of pre-harvest and post-harvest risk management strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3778-8754"], "LastName": "Adhikari", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chhetri", "ForeName": "V S", "Initials": "VS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cason", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luu", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suazo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1006167", "Agency": "USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8061YMS4RM", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorine dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Foodborne Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Medicago sativa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Adhikari, A., Syamaladevi, R.M., Killinger, K. and Sablani, S.S.
