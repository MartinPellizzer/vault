However, the isotopic accumulation rates measured in leaf tissue were much lower than the modelled stomatal flux of ozone. * Our new approach has considerable potential to elucidate the fate and reactions of ozone within both plants and soils, at scales ranging from plant communities to cellular defence mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Department, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toet", "ForeName": "Sylvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stockholm Environment Institute, Department of Biology, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subke", "ForeName": "Jens-Arne", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biology, Institute for Research on Environment and Sustainability (IRES), Devonshire Building, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D'Haese", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Department, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashmore", "ForeName": "Mike R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stockholm Environment Institute, Department of Biology, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emberson", "ForeName": "Lisa D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Organic Geochemistry Unit, Biogeochemistry Research Centre, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TS, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crossman", "ForeName": "Zoe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Organic Geochemistry Unit, Biogeochemistry Research Centre, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TS, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evershed", "ForeName": "Richard P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biology, Institute for Research on Environment and Sustainability (IRES), Devonshire Building, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "Jeremy D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ineson", "ForeName": "Phil", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Isotope Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trifolium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ashmore MR. 2005.
