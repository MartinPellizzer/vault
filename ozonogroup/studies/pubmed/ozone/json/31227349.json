To understand the origins of PAN, a field measurement was conducted at Tung Chung site (TC) in suburban Hong Kong from October to November 2016. The average level of PAN was 0.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05\u202fppbv, with a maximum of 7.30\u202fppbv. Higher PAN/O<sub>3</sub> ratio (0.043-0.058) was captured on episodes, i.e. when hourly maximum O<sub>3</sub> exceeded 80\u202fppbv, than on non-episodes (0.01), since O<sub>3</sub> production was less efficient than PAN when there was an elevation of precursors (i.e. volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>)). Model simulations revealed that oxidations of acetaldehyde (65.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.3%), methylglyoxal (MGLY, 12.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2%) and other oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) (8.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6%), and radical cycling (12.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%) were the major production pathways of peroxyacetyl (PA) radical, while local PAN formation was controlled by both VOCs and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). Among all VOC species, carbonyls made the highest contribution (59%) to PAN formation, followed by aromatics (26%) and biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) (10%) through direct oxidation/decomposition. Besides, active VOCs (i.e. carbonyls, aromatics, BVOCs and alkenes/alkynes) could stimulate hydroxyl (OH) production, thus indirectly facilitating the PAN formation. Apart from primary emissions, carbonyls were also generated from oxidation of first-generation precursors, i.e., hydrocarbons, of which xylenes contributed the most to PAN production. Furthermore, PAN formation suppressed local O<sub>3</sub> formation at a rate of 2.84\u202fppbv/ppbv, when NO<sub>2</sub>, OH and hydroperoxy (HO<sub>2</sub>) levels decreased and nitrogen monoxide (NO) value enhanced. Namely, O<sub>3</sub> was reduced by 2.84\u202fppbv per ppbv PAN formation. Net O<sub>3</sub> production rate was weakened (\u223c36%) due to PAN photochemistry, so as each individual production and loss pathway. The findings advanced our knowledge of atmospheric PAN and its impact on O<sub>3</sub> production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
