In this work, 55,428 hospital records with 847 doctor-diagnosed CA from July 2013 to December 2016 were collected in Hohhot, China. Maternal exposure to critical air pollutants (SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>) were estimated using an inverse distance weighted (IDW) method on the basis of the ambient air quality monitoring stations. Logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the association of CA (in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)) in three trimesters with heating/none heating season exposure. The results showed that CO exposure was found a significant association with ORs (95% CI) 1.58 (1.09, 2.27) changing from IQR2-3 and 1.40 (1.01, 1.93) changing from IQR3-IQR4 in 1st trimester and 1.51 (1.12, 2.04) changing from IQR2-3 in 2nd trimester, respectively. PM<sub>10</sub> also presented significant association with ORs (95% CI) 1.42(1.08, 1.86) changing from IQR3-4 in 2nd trimester. Exposure effects were found more obvious in heating season, i.e. CO exposure levels were associated with the risks of CA with IQR changing ORs (95% CI) of 5.21(2.02, 7.44), 2.24 (1.21, 4.15) and 1.84 (1.10, 3.11) in 1st trimester, respectively; PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure levels were associated with the risks of CA with IQR changing ORs (95% CI) of 3.76 (1.48, 6.55), 2.45 (1.10, 5.44) and 3.30 (1.63, 6.67) in 2nd trimester, respectively. Our findings suggested some positive associations of pregnancy and CA with maternal exposure to ambient CO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the 1st and 2nd trimester after controlling for maternal comorbidities general covariates and other pollutants. PM<sub>10</sub> was also found significantly associated with increased risk of CA in 2<sub>nd</sub> trimester besides seasons. There was no association found in 3rd trimester."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
