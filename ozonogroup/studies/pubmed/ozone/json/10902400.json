For many problems, mathematical optimization can be used to simplify the design process by identifying cost-effective solutions. Optimization applications for controlling nonlinearly reactive pollutants such as tropospheric ozone, however, have been lacking because of the difficulty in representing nonlinear chemistry in mathematical programming models. We discuss the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) as an alternative optimization approach for developing ozone control strategies. A GA formulation is described and demonstrated for an urban-scale ozone control problem in which controls are considered for thousands of pollutant sources simultaneously. A simple air quality model is integrated into the GA to represent ozone transport and chemistry. Variations of the GA formulation for multiobjective and chance-constrained optimization are also presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practically of using more sophisticated, regulatory-scale air quality models with the GA. We anticipate that such an approach will be practical in the near term for supporting regulatory decision-making."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA. dan_loughlin@ncsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loughlin", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ranjithan", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baugh", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brill", "ForeName": "E D", "Initials": "ED", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decision Making"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Policy Making"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10902400", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464133"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
