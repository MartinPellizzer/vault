While links between air pollutants and depression were explored, there was a notable scarcity of research focusing on the workforce.", "This nationwide longitudinal study analyzed 27,457 workers aged 15-64. We estimated monthly mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), its primary components, and Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at participants' residences using spatiotemporal models. To assess the relationship between short- (1 to 3\u00a0months) and long-term (1 to 2\u00a0years) exposure to various air pollutants and depressive levels and occurrences, we employed linear mixed-effects models and mixed-effects logistic regression. We considered potential occupational moderators, such as labor contracts, overtime compensation, and total annual income.", "We found significant increases in depression risks within the workforce linked to both short- and long-term air pollution exposure. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> rise in 2-year average PM<sub>2.5</sub>, black carbon (BC), and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations correlated with increments in depressive scores of 0.009, 0.173, and 0.010, and a higher likelihood of depression prevalence by 0.5\u00a0%, 12.6\u00a0%, and 0.7\u00a0%. The impacts of air pollutants and depression were more prominent in people without labor contracts, overtime compensation, and lower total incomes.", "Exposures to air pollutants could increase the risk of depression in the labor force population.
