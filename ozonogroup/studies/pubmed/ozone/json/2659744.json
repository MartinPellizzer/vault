The extent and significance of these effects, and the multibillion dollar costs of ambient O3 controls need to be considered in any future revisions of ambient standards and the Clean Air Act. The transient effects of O3 are more closely related to cumulative daily exposure than to one hour peak concentrations, and future revisions of the ambient standard for O3 should take this into account. The effects of long-term chronic exposure to O3 remain poorly defined, but recent epidemiologic and animal inhalation studies suggest that current ambient levels are sufficient to cause premature aging of the lungs. More research is needed to determine the need for a standard with a seasonal or annual average concentration limit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lippmann", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES 00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "JAPCA", "NlmUniqueID": "8802680", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0630"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "NumberOfReferences": "160"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2659744", "10.1080/08940630.1989.10466554"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
