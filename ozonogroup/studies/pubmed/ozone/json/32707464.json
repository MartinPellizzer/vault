It was higher than that of \u03b1-FeOOH with a COD removal of 50 %. The effects of Mg/Al atomic ratio, phosphate and pyrrole on the ozonation performance of Mg/Al HTs were also investigated. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiment and temperature programmed desorption of adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub> were used to characterize the surface properties of Mg/Al HT. The surface acidity and basity was proven to be responsible to the excellent ozonation activity of Mg/Al HT. The results of electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis and probe experiments confirmed that OH, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> were involved in the 2,4-D degradation process and their contributions are as followed: OH\u2009>\u2009O<sub>2</sub>- > <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. The synergistic effect of surface acid (ozone adsorption center) and base sites (catalytic center) determines Mg/Al HT in the enhanced catalytic ozone decomposition into reactive species. More important, the transition metal free based Mg/Al HTs is steady, non-toxic, naturally abundant and environment friendly, which provided a promising alternative in practical water treatment by catalytic ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
