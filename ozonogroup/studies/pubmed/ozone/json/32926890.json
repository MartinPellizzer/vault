Treating daily number of medical care visits for AD as a dependent variable, generalized additive models with Poisson distributions were constructed, which included air pollutant levels, ambient temperature, relative humidity, day of the week, national holiday, and season. Risks were expressed as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) per interquartile range increase of each air pollutant.", "Higher levels of particulate matter of diameter \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) (RR, 1.009; 95% CI, 1.007-1.012), ozone (1.028; 1.023-1.033), and sulfur dioxide (1.033; 1.030-1.037) were significantly associated with increased risk of medical care visits for AD on same days. In all age and sex groups, ozone was associated with a significantly higher risk of medical care visits, with the greatest risk among 13- to 18-year-old males (RR, 1.127; 95% CI, 1.095-1.159).", "This study suggests relationships of ambient PM<sub>10</sub>, ozone, and sulfur dioxide levels with medical care visits for AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
