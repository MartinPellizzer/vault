This study estimated the effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures on inflammatory biomarkers in women with normal early pregnancy (NEP) or clinically recognized early pregnancy loss (CREPL). Serum interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were measured in 228 early pregnant women recruited in Tianjin, China. Maternal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures at lag 0 through lag 30 before blood collection were estimated using temporally-adjusted land use regression models. Daily exposures to ambient PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO and 8-hours maximum ozone were estimated using city-level concentrations. Single-day lag effects at lag 0 through lag 7 were estimated using multivariable linear regression models. Distributed lag effects and cumulative effects over the preceding seven days and 30 days were estimated using distributed lag non-linear models. Serum IL-1\u03b2 (8.0% increase at lag 3), IL-6 (33.9% increase at lag 5) and TNF-\u03b1 (12.7% increase at lag 5) in early pregnant women were significantly increased with an interquartile range increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures adjusted for temporal confounders and demographic characteristics. These effects were robust in several two-pollutant models. Distributed lag effects over the preceding 30 days also showed that the three cytokines were significantly increased with PM<sub>2.5</sub> on some lag days. Among all cumulative effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on the three cytokines in all subjects or in the two groups, only IL-6 was significantly increased in CREPL women over the preceding seven days and 30 days. No significant cumulative effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> was observed in NEP women. In conclusion, exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> may induce systemic inflammation in women in the first trimester of pregnancy. Whether the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related cumulative increase in maternal IL-6 is involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of early pregnancy loss needs to be identified in future research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
