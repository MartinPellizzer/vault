We have examined the biomedical and physicochemical performance of this instrument. Prokariotic and gram-negative Escherichia coli and eukariotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed by silver electrolysis in 18 min and 1 min, respectively. Prokariotic and gram-positive Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus, which are most resistant to autoclave and gas sterilization, respectively, were killed by silver electrolysis within 20 min. Prokariotic and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also killed by silver electrolysis in 10 min. The intensity distribution of the ultrasonic levitation waves was homogeneous throughout the tank. The concentration of ozone gas was 2.57 mg/ kg. The concentration of dissolved silver ions was around 0.17 mg/L. The disulfide bond in proteins was confirmed to be destroyed by silver electrolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Meisei University 2-1-1, Hodokubo, Hino-shi, Tokyo 191-8506, Japan. uedatoyo@chem.meisei-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ueda", "ForeName": "Toyotoshi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hara", "ForeName": "Masanori", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Odagawa", "ForeName": "Ikumi", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shigihara", "ForeName": "Takanori", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biocontrol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9712121", "ISSNLinking": "1342-4815"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Equipment and Supplies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19344093", "10.4265/bio.14.1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
