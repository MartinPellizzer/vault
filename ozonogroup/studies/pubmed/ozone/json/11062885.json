The effects of ultrasound wave in hydrophilic chemical oxidations are mainly due to hydroxyl radical production during the cavitation-induced water decomposition. Currently, the sonochemical destruction of aromatic compounds in water solution is obtained with low rates. The aim of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of the sonochemical effect in conjunction with a photochemical irradiation. Taking phenol as an example, the combined action of sonochemistry and photochemistry has been considered in a 'sonuv' reactor. An important enhancement of the degradation rate of phenol has been observed. It may be the result of three different oxidative processes: direct photochemical action, high frequency sonochemistry and reaction with ozone (produced by UV irradiation of air). The process has been successfully tested to lower the chemical oxygen demand of a municipal wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Chimie Mol\u00e9culaire et Environnement, ESIGEC, Universit\u00e9 de Savoie, Le Bourget du Lac, France. emmanuel.naffrechoux@univ-savoie.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naffrechoux", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chanoux", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrier", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suptil", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ultrason Sonochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9433356", "ISSNLinking": "1350-4177"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11062885", "10.1016/s1350-4177(00)00054-7", "S1350417700000547"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
