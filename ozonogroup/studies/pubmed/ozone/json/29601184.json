In this work, aging of side-stream cigarette smoke was studied in an environmental chamber via exposure to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), hydroxyl radicals (OH) and indoor fluorescent lights. Aerosol mass concentrations increased by 13-18% upon exposure to 15 ppb O<sub>3</sub> and by 8-42% upon exposure to 0.45 ppt OH. Ultrafine particle (UFP) formation was observed during all ozone experiments, regardless of the primary smoke aerosol concentration (185-1950 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>). During OH oxidation, however, UFP formed only when the primary particle concentration was relatively low (<130 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>) and the OH concentration was high (\u223c1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>). Online aerosol composition measurements show that oxygen- and nitrogen- containing species were formed during oxidation. Gas phase oxidation of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> occurred during fluorescent light exposure, but neither primary particle growth nor UFP formation were observed. Overall, exposure of cigarette smoke to ozone will likely lead to UFP formation in indoor environments. On the other hand, UPF formation via OH oxidation will only occur when OH concentrations are high (\u223c10<sup>7</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>), and is therefore less likely to have an impact on indoor aerosol associated with cigarette smoke."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9565-8777"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street , M5S 3H6 , Toronto , Ontario Canada."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6248-9644"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street , M5S 3H6 , Toronto , Ontario Canada."}], "LastName": "Collins", "ForeName": "Douglas B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4990-1374"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street , M5S 3H6 , Toronto , Ontario Canada."}], "LastName": "Hems", "ForeName": "Rachel F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9302-368X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street , M5S 3H6 , Toronto , Ontario Canada."}], "LastName": "Borduas", "ForeName": "Nadine", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6769-0470"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street , M5S 3H6 , Toronto , Ontario Canada."}], "LastName": "Anti\u00f1olo", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3372-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street , M5S 3H6 , Toronto , Ontario Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29601184", "10.1021/acs.est.7b06608"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
