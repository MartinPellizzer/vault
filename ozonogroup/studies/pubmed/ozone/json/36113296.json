During textile processing, the consumption of dyes and complex chemicals at various stages makes textile industrial wastewater highly challenging. Therefore, conventional processes based on single-unit treatment may not be sufficient to comply with the environmental quality discharge standards and more stringent guidelines for zero discharge of hazardous chemicals (ZDHC). In this study, a novel approach was followed by recycling Poly aluminum chloride (PACl) and Alum as a catalyst for the first time in the catalytic ozonation treatment process leading to a nascent method after using them as a coagulant in Coagulation/Flocculation. In the current investigation, six different combinations were studied to remove turbidity, TSS, COD, BOD<sub>5</sub>, color, and biodegradability (BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD ratios) of wastewater. Moreover, Central Composite Design was implied using RSM in Minitab software. During the combination of treatment processes, it was found that the pre-coagulation/flocculation with coagulant PACl followed by post-catalytic ozonation with recycled PACl, a more effective treatment than others. The optimum R.E of turbidity, TSS, COD, and color were 84%, 86%, 89%, and 98%, respectively. Moreover, a decrease in toxicity and increase in biodegradability (BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD ratio from 0.29 to 0.54) was observed as well. The electrical energy demand and operational costs of treatment processes were estimated and compared with other treatment processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
