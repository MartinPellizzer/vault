Results show that the three PABs have a low ozone reactivity (k<sub>O3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.11\u20120.12 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), and therefore are mainly abated through the hydrogen abstraction mechanism by hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) during ozonation. During PAB degradation, the carboxamide moiety in the parent molecules can be cleaved off by <sup>\u2022</sup>OH attack and thus gives rise to DCAM. The formed DCAM can then be further oxidized by O<sub>3</sub> and/or <sup>\u2022</sup>OH to DCAA as a more stable transformation product (TP). When the three PABs were adequately abated (abatement efficiency of \u223c82\u00a0%\u201295\u00a0%), the molar yields of DCAM and DCAA were determined to be 2.79\u00a0%\u20124.71\u00a0% and 32.9\u00a0%\u201237.2\u00a0%, respectively. Furthermore, post-chloramination of the ozonation effluents increased the yields of DCAM and DCAA slightly to 4.20\u00a0%\u20126.45\u00a0% and 39.0\u00a0%\u201241.1\u00a0%, respectively. In comparison, post-chlorination eliminated DCAM in the solutions, but significantly increased DCAA yields to \u223c100\u00a0% due to the further conversion of DCAM and other ozonation TPs to DCAA by chlorine oxidation. The results of this study indicate that high yields of DCAM and DCAA can be generated from PAB degradation during ozonation, and post-chlorination and post-chloramination will result in very different fates of DCAM and DCAA in the disinfected effluent. The formation and transformation of DCAM and DCAA during PAB degradation need to be taken into account when selecting multi-barrier treatment processes for the treatment of PAB-containing water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
