In recent studies, medical ozone has shown promising results in alleviating inflammation and infection. Here, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of medical ozone in sepsis-induced ALI using a mouse model, measuring behavioral assessments, lung function, and blood flow. Western blot was used to quantify the levels of protein. In vitro, experiments on BMDM cells examine the impact of AMPK inhibitors and agonists on phagocytic activity. Results indicate that medical ozone can enhance the survival rate, ameliorate lung injury, and improve lung function and limb microcirculation in mice with ALI. Notably, it inhibits NETs formation, a crucial player in ALI development. Medical ozone also counteracts elevated TF, MMP-9, and IL-1\u03b2 levels. In ALI mice, the effects of ozone are nullified and BMDMs exhibit impaired engulfment of NETs following <i>Sr-a1</i> knockout. Under normal physiological conditions, the use of an AMPK antagonist produces similar effects to <i>Sr-a1</i> knockout, significantly inhibiting the phagocytosis of NETs by BMDMs. On the contrary, AMPK agonists enhance this phagocytic process. In conclusion, medical ozone can alleviate sepsis-induced lung injury via the AMPK/SR-A1 pathway, thereby enhancing phagocytosis of NETs by macrophages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
