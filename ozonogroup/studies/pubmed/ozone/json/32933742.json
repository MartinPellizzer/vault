Ag-doped catalysts prepared by sol-gel method were characterized, illustrating that Ag entirely entered the crystalline of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and changed the surface properties. The addition of catalyst enhanced the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometer, ultraviolet light absorbance at 254\u00a0nm and three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix suggested that aromatic compounds were efficiently degraded and toxic substances, such as dibutyl phthalate. In addition, the radical scavenging experiments confirmed the hydroxyl radicals acted as the main reactive oxygen species and the surface properties of catalysts played an important role in the reaction. Overall, this work validated potential applications of Ag-doped NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyzed ozonation process of biologically recalcitrant wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
