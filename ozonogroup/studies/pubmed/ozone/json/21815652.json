A micromanipulator is used to manipulate and deform the NWs under a high-magnification optical microscope in real time. The static friction force is measured based on \"the most-bent state\" of the NWs. The static friction and interface shear strength are found to depend on the ultraviolet/ozone (UVO) treatment of PDMS. The shear strength starts at 0.30 MPa without UVO treatment, increases rapidly up to 10.57 MPa at 60 min of treatment and decreases for longer treatment. Water contact angle measurements suggest that the UVO-induced hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic conversion of PDMS surface is responsible for the increase in the static friction, while the hydrophobic recovery effect contributes to the decrease. The static friction between NWs and PDMS is of critical relevance to many device applications of NWs including NW-based flexible/stretchable electronics, NW assembly and nanocomposites (e.g., supercapacitors). Our results will enable quantitative interface design and control for such applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, 911 Oval Drive, Campus Box 7910, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Qingquan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21815652", "10.1021/nn202343w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
