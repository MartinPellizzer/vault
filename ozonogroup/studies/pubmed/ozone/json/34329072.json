Here we assessed the intraday effect of air pollution on AMI risk and potential effect modification by pre-existing cardiac risk factors. Hourly data on emergency department visits (EDVs) for AMI and air pollutants in Brisbane, Australia during 2013-2015 were acquired from pertinent government departments. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was adopted to examine relationships of AMI risk with hourly changes in particulate matters (aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>)) and gaseous pollutants (ozone and nitrogen dioxide) after adjusting for potential confounders. We also conducted stratified analyses according to age, gender, disease history, season, and day/night time exposure. Excess risk of AMI per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in air pollutant concentration was reported at four time windows: within 1, 2-6, 7-12, and 13-24\u00a0h. Both single- and multi-pollutant models found an elevated risk of AMI within 2-6\u00a0h after exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (excessive risk: 12.34%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.44%-24.42% in single-pollutant model) and PM<sub>10</sub> within 1\u00a0h (excessive risk: 5.21%, 95% CI: 0.26%-10.40% in single-pollutant model). We did not find modification effect by age, gender, season or day/night time, except that PM<sub>2.5</sub> had a greater effect on EDVs for AMI during night-time than daytime. Our findings suggest that AMI risk could increase within hours after exposure to particulate matters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
