The discrepancy between the observation and the CAQRA reanalysis datasets (2013-2019) was investigated in terms of the concentration variation pattern, which determines the exposure metric change. A set of domestic short-term C-R coefficients for the all-age population were integrated using the meta-analysis respectively corresponding to the metrics of MDA1, MDA8, and Daily average. The dataset-based deviations of the short-term attributable factors (AFs) and their corresponding premature mortalities were respectively about 16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.3\u00a0% and <5\u00a0% based on MDA8, much smaller than other two metrics; and the MDA8-based evaluation results were the most sensitive to the deteriorative ozone pollution, with the maximum upward trends of 0.095-0.129\u00a0%/year. Accordingly, MDA8 was recognized as the most applicable short-term metric. For the long-term exposure, the domestic summer metric SMDA8 could not exactly represent the peak-season ozone maximum level in the GBA, with the deviation from 6MMDA8 as much as 30\u00a0%. By considering the ability of metric to represent the peak-season ozone, the relatively smaller dataset-based discrepancies of AFs (6MMDA8-WHO2021: 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.9\u00a0%, AMDA8-T2016: 20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.8\u00a0%) and the attributable premature mortalities (6MMDA8-WHO2021: 5\u00a0%, AMDA8-T2016: 8\u00a0%), and the higher sensitivity of the evaluation results to the deteriorative ozone pollution (6MMDA8-WHO2021: 0.13\u00a0%;year, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01; AMDA8-T2016: 0.15\u00a0%/year, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), the schemes of 6MMDA8-WHO2021 and AMDA8-T2016 were recognized relatively more preferable for the adult (\u226525-year) long-term evaluation. Based on the recognized metric/schemes, the central and the eastern PRE areas of higher NO<sub>2</sub> level in the GBA were experiencing the highest health burdens from 2013 to 2019."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
