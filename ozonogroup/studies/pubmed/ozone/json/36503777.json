For many cities, it is still under debate whether the trend of surface O<sub>3</sub> variation is driven by meteorology or the change in precursors emissions. In this work, a time series decomposition method (Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL)) and random forest (RF) algorithm were utilized to quantify the meteorological impacts on the recorded O<sub>3</sub> trend and identify the key meteorological factors affecting O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Tianjin, the biggest coastal port city in Northern China. After \"removing\" the meteorological fluctuations from the observed O<sub>3</sub> time series, we found that variation of O<sub>3</sub> in Tianjin was largely driven by the changes in precursors emissions. The meteorology was unfavorable for O<sub>3</sub> pollution in period of 2015-2016, and turned out to be favorable during 2017-2021. Specifically, meteorology contributed 9.3 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> O<sub>3</sub> (13%) in 2019, together with the increase in precursors emissions, making 2019 to be the worst year of O<sub>3</sub> pollution since 2015. Since then, the favorable effects of meteorology on O<sub>3</sub> pollution tended to be weaker. Temperature was the most important factor affecting O<sub>3</sub> level, followed by air humidity in O<sub>3</sub> pollution season. In the midday of summer days, O<sub>3</sub> pollution frequently exceeded the standard level (>160 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) at a combined condition with relative humidity in 40%-50% and temperature > 31\u00b0C. Both the temperature and the dryness of the atmosphere need to be subtly considered for summer O<sub>3</sub> forecasting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
