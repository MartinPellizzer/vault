Bromate (BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e) formation often occurred during the ozonation process in the presence of Br\u203e. BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e is classified as a potential human carcinogen, so both the Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e concentrations must be strictly controlled before and after an ozone-based treatment procedure, respectively. This work reports on distance-based paper analytical devices (dPADs) that have been modified with silver hexagonal nanoprisms (AgNPrs) for highly sensitive and selective determination of both Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e. The measurement of BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e is based upon its conversion to bromine vapor (Br<sub>2</sub>) when gauged with a paper-based headspace extractor (PAD-HS) that is coupled with dPADs (PAD-HS-dPADs). For Br\u203e analysis, O<sub>2</sub> plays an important role in the change from Br\u203e to Br<sub>2</sub> within an acid media. Br<sub>2</sub> changes rapidly in water to give us HBrO which is a strong oxidizing agent of AgNPrs. Then, the oxidative reaction of the AgNPrs (pink color) within the presence of Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e establishes both silver bromide (AgBr) and the silver nanosphere (AgNPs, yellow color), which can then be easily observed as a change of a pink color band to a yellow color band by the naked eye. Quantification of Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e is then achieved by measuring the length of the yellow color band. Under the optimal conditions, the calibration curve will be linear in the range of 25\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> to 2\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and from 0.5 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> for Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e, respectively. The naked-eye detection limits were found to be 10 and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> for Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e, respectively. The proposed dPADs for the Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e detection exhibited an exceptional sensor performance combined with a low detection limit. They also have the benefits of ease of use, an instrument-free convenience, coupled with portability and a low-cost efficiency. Consequently, our sensing device should be applied to the low-level detection of Br\u203e and BrO<sub>3</sub>\u203e in real samples, including drinking water, rice, and flour."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
