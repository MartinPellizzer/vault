Vehicular emissions can be measured inside road tunnels, and those measurements can provide information about emission factors of in-use vehicles. Emission factors are used to estimate vehicular emissions and are described as the amount of species emitted per vehicle distance driven or per volume of fuel consumed. This study presents emission factor data for fine particles, coarse particles, inhalable particulate matter and black carbon, as well as size distribution data for inhalable particulate matter, as measured in March and May of 2004, respectively, in the J\u00e2nio Quadros and Maria Maluf road tunnels, both located in S\u00e3o Paulo. The J\u00e2nio Quadros tunnel carries mainly light-duty vehicles, whereas the Maria Maluf tunnel carries light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. In the J\u00e2nio Quadros tunnel, the estimated light-duty vehicle emission factors for the trace elements copper and bromine were 261 and 220 microg km(-1), respectively, and 16, 197, 127 and 92 mg km(-1), respectively, for black carbon, inhalable particulate matter, coarse particles and fine particles. The mean contribution of heavy-duty vehicles to the emissions of black carbon, inhalable particulate matter, coarse particles and fine particles was, respectively 29, 4, 6 and 6 times higher than that of light-duty vehicles. The inhalable particulate matter emission factor for heavy-duty vehicles was 1.2 times higher than that found during dynamometer testing. In general, the particle emissions in S\u00e3o Paulo tunnels are higher than those found in other cities of the world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rua do Mat\u00e3o 1226, 05508-090 S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez-Ccoyllo", "ForeName": "Od\u00f3n R", "Initials": "OR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ynoue", "ForeName": "Rita Y", "Initials": "RY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Leila D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Astolfo", "ForeName": "Rosana", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miranda", "ForeName": "Regina M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freitas", "ForeName": "Edmilson D", "Initials": "ED"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borges", "ForeName": "Alessandro S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fornaro", "ForeName": "Adalgiza", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freitas", "ForeName": "Helber", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9a", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andrade", "ForeName": "Maria F", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2002;116(2):257-63", "ArticleIdList": ["11806453"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2006 Nov 1;40(21):6722-9", "ArticleIdList": ["17144302"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 1997 Dec;47(12):1297-300", "ArticleIdList": ["9448518"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18228152", "10.1007/s10661-008-0198-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
