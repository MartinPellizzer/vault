Antimicrobial radicals were generated from the UV-C degradation of hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorite and ozone gas. Response surface modeling was used to identify the interaction among the operating parameters for the hydroxyl radical process: UV-C254nm intensity, hydrogen peroxide concentration, and ozone delivered. There was an inverse relationship between hydrogen peroxide concentration and UV-C intensity in terms of the log reduction of L. monocytogenes. The independent parameters for the chlorine radical process were hypochlorite concentration, pH, and UV-C intensity. From predictive models, the optimal hydroxyl radical treatment was found to be 5% (v/v) H2O2, 2.86 mW/cm2 UV-C intensity (total UV-C dose 144 mJ/cm2), and 16.5 mg of ozone. The optimal parameters for the chlorine radical process were 10 ppm of hypochlorite (pH 3.0), 11.0 mg of ozone, and 4.60 mW/cm2 UV-C intensity. When inoculated mushrooms were treated with the optimal hydroxyl radical and chlorine radical processes, the reduction of L. monocytogenes was found to be 2.42 \u00b1 0.42 and 2.61 \u00b1 0.30 log CFU, respectively, without any negative effects on mushroom quality (weight loss and Browning index during 14 days of storage at 4\u00b0C). These reductions were significantly greater than those from application of the individual elements of the radical processes and those in the control process, which used a 90-s dip in 1% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. The study has demonstrated that hydroxyl radical and chlorine radical vapor-phase treatments are equally effective at inactivating L. monocytogenes on mushrooms and can be considered as a preventative control step."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9, International Association for Food Protection."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hongran", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9388-0729"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "LastName": "Hasani", "ForeName": "Mahdiyeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "LastName": "Alisha", "ForeName": "Alisha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6742-4815"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "LastName": "Warriner", "ForeName": "Keith", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Agaricus bisporus"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agaricus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "50"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34189580", "10.4315/JFP-21-217", "S0362-028X(22)05719-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
