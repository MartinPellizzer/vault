Along with standard therapy, all patients received systemic and local ozone therapy. Patients complaints were recorded before and after treatment. Questionnaires for total assessment of the symptoms of CAPIC and male sexual function were used for monitoring of clinical manifestations.", "Sexual disturbances before and after treatment were less pronounced in patients with normostenic somatotype in comparison to patients with asthenic and pyknic somatotypes. Pain syndrome was less common in normostenic patients (0.83+/-0.09 points). The most severe dysuric symptoms (<0.03) was noted in patients with pyknic somatotype, such as weak urine stream, interrupted stream and incomplete bladder emptying (1.33+/-0.14 points), increased frequency of urination (0.91+/-0.11 points), dribbling (1.22+/-0.14 points). In addition, they had a maximum influence of the symptoms of CAPIC on the professional activity (1.50+/-0.08 points; <0.02). After treatment, a clinical index (CI) of CAPIC in the severity of clinical manifestations in patients of the normostenic somatotype was insignificant (9.29+/-0.55 points), while in patients with asthenic and pyknic somatotype it was moderate, almost insignificant (11.71+/-0.62 and 13.62+/-0.61 points, respectively). Overall, CAPIC was the most severe in patients with a pyknic somatotype, which was objectively confirmed by the of CI of CAPIC. However, standard therapy with a using of regional and local ozone therapy in these patients were more efficient in comparison with patients with other somatotypes and was accompanied by an almost twice decrease in CI of CAPIC (from 24.32+/-0.73 to 13.62+/-0.61 points)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FGBOU VO Krasnoyarsk State Medical University named after professor V.F.
