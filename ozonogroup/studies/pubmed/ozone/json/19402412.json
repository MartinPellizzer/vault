The results showed that the higher the initial concentration of EMS, the more ozone was generated in the simulative reactions. It was found that the light intensity plays a very important role in the evaluation of ozone formation potential for EMS. The parameters of d(O3-NO) and IR (incremental reactivity) were used to quantify the potential of EMS on ozone formation. The obtained maximum IR values in this article for the five simulative reactions were 1.55 x 10(-2), 0.99 x 10(-2), 1.36 x 10(-2), 2.47 x 10(-2), and 1.65 x 10(-2), respectively. A comparison between the results we obtained here and the results we obtained previously for di-tert-butyl peroxide and acetylene showed that the potential reactivity of EMS on ozone formation was at a relatively low level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species, Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China. wangkun05@iccas.ac.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Maofa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylmethyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19402412", "10.1016/s1001-0742(08)62241-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
