The retrieval strategies were set as follows: TS= ( (\"Tropospheric Ozone\" OR \"Low Level Ozone\" OR \"Ground Level Ozone\") AND (\"Air pollution*\" OR \"Air quality\") ) . The survey included 2084 articles. By using bibliometric research and visual analysis tools, the research status of global ground-level ozone pollution was revealed from the aspects of time, discipline, journal, financing, institution, country and key words. <b>Results:</b> Cumulative publications increased in a cubic function of <i>y</i>=0.05<i>x</i>(3)+0.80<i>x</i>(2)+0.74<i>x</i>+4.55 (<i>R</i>(2)=0.999, <i>P</i><0.01) . The most studied subject was Environmental sciences ecology (1401 articles, 67.23%) . <i>Atmospheric Environment</i> was the journal with the most articles (332 articles, 15.93%) . The United States was the country with the most publications (44.67%, 931/2084) , while China ranked second (17.13%, 357/2084) . 80.39% (287/357) of Chinese papers had funding information. Among the top 10 research institutions, 7 and 2 were affiliated to the United States and China respectively. Source apportionment and human health were high frequency keywords that had appeared in the last 5 years. <b>Conclusion:</b> The research on ground-level ozone pollution is in a good period of development. The United States has a leading position in this area, and China has a good prospect in this field. Pollution source apportionment and human health effects are new research directions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "X A", "Initials": "XA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "L L", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Y F", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Z P", "Initials": "ZP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "81773386", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8410840", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9391"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bibliometrics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Publications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33691367", "10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20200114-00027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
