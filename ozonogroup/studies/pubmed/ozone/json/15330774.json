One-hundred and six flight segments were monitored for either the full duration and/or approximately 3 h during the middle portion of the flight for a total of 145 time-integrated measurements. Over all samples the mean (+/-SD) concentration was 80 p.p.b. (30.1). Twenty percent of the measurements exceeded 100 p.p.b., the FAA-recommended level. Eleven percent of the measurements exceeded 120 p.p.b., the US EPA's short-term National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone. Ozone concentrations measured on Pacific flights were substantially higher during mid-flight than over the full flight (95 p.p.b. vs. 56 p.p.b). Ozone concentrations on the northern Pacific routes were higher than concentrations for other Pacific flights. Season comparison showed that ozone levels were higher during the winter and spring than for the summer and fall. Our study shows that even in aircraft with catalytic ozone converters, passengers and flight crew may be exposed to elevated ozone levels on domestic and international flights. Given the frequency of ozone excess, it is recommended that (1) ozone converters should be required equipment on all commercial passenger aircraft for mid and high latitude routes (2) improved maintenance procedures should be required for catalytic converters (e.g., more frequent servicing/replacement), and (3) ozone should be routinely monitored on all mid and high latitude flights.", "The authors have demonstrated elevated ozone concentrations in passenger cabins. They give several practical recommendations to help solve the problem."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure, Epidemiology and Risk Program, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02215, USA. spengler@hsph.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spengler", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ludwig", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weker", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES000002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Indoor Air", "NlmUniqueID": "9423515", "ISSNLinking": "0905-6947"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pacific Ocean"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15330774", "10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00275.x", "INA275"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
