In January and February 2020, estimated ship emissions of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> over Southern China dropped by 19, 71, and 58%, respectively, relative to the same period in 2019. The decline of ship NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions was mostly over the coastal waters and inland waterways of Southern China due to reduced ship activities. The decline of ship SO<sub>2</sub> and primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions was most pronounced outside the Chinese Domestic Emission Control Area due to the switch to low-sulfur fuel oil there. Ship emission reductions in early 2020 drove 16 to 18% decreases in surface NO<sub>2</sub> levels but 3.8 to 4.9% increases in surface ozone over Southern China. We estimated that ship emissions contributed 40% of surface NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over Guangdong in winter. Our results indicated that future abatements of ship emissions should be implemented synergistically with reductions of land-borne anthropogenic emissions of nonmethane volatile organic compounds to effectively alleviate regional ozone pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8226-9403"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John A.
