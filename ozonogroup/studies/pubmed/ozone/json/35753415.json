This work presents evidence for formation of extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs) from styrene ozonolysis. The molecules of ELVOCs were analyzed using a high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer. The results show that ELVOCs were oligomers characterized by stabilized Criegee radicals (SCIs) as chain units. The addition of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHOO (SCI1) or CH<sub>2</sub>OO (SCI2) can dramatically decrease the oligomers' volatility. At low relative humidity (RH), ELVOCs are mainly formed from the reaction of RO<sub>2</sub> radical, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OO\u00b7, with SCI1 and SCI2; however, ELVOCs are primarily produced by the reaction between benzoic acid and SCI1 at high RH. Ambient particles were also collected to propose the probable oligomers from styrene-SCI. Our results suggest that styrene-SCI derived ELVOCs may act as nucleating agents, potentially providing an experimental basis for nucleation events that frequently occur in urban areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
