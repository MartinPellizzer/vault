Ozonation and adsorption on activated carbon are the most suitable processes for CECs removal in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). This study aims at evaluating the performance of ozonation and adsorption as in-series processes compared to those of the stand-alone processes, focusing on 18 compounds representative of various CECs families. No CECs spike was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these processes towards CECs at their environmental concentrations. Adsorption isotherms were performed on water samples collected before and after the full-scale ozonation in a DWTP, testing different combinations of ozone and activated carbon doses. Generally, the combination of the two processes was beneficial (83% average removal) compared to adsorption and ozonation alone (71% and 34% average removal respectively). The effect of ozonation on adsorption depends on CECs reactivity with ozone, since ozonation improves the adsorption performance of poorly-oxidizable CECs, but worsens that of well-oxidizable compounds. The removal of organic matter, investigated by absorbance at 254\u00a0nm and fluorescence, by ozonation reduces competition for the subsequent CECs removal by adsorption (up to 20% increase of total CECs adsorption). Finally, the removal of both absorbance and fluorescence seems to be a good proxy variables for total CECs adsorption, with different relationships depending on the presence of ozonation. Conversely, it is not effective for ozonation, since the relationship depends on the reactivity of the specific CEC with ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
