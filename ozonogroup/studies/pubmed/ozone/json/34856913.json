Although topical application of a pediculicide such as permethrin shampoo is the most common cure for head lice, the addition of alternative treatments is necessary due to permethrin resistance and some safety concerns, including irritation, burning sensation, tingling, and breathing problems. Recent studies have indicated that ozone, which is an allotropic form of oxygen, may have anti-pediculosis effects.", "This study focused on the evaluation of an ozonated olive oil topical lotion for the treatment of pediculosis and the comparison of its effects with permethrin shampoo.", "121 patients with proven head pediculosis were divided into two groups. They were treated with either topical ozonated olive oil lotion or permethrin shampoo for one week.", "It was shown that the ozonation process enormously improved the physico-chemical properties of olive oil. Specifically, acid and peroxide values increased 60 fold and 200 fold, respectively, while there was a sharp decline for the iodine index (81.8\u00b11.28 to 0 g iodine per 100 g). Additionally, all patients who received the ozonated olive oil lotion were entirely cured after one week of treatment, while those who were treated with permethrin, required to receive more. Statistical analysis of the data also proved this claim.", "The prepared lotion has shown significant effects in controlling head lice. Thus, it can be prescribed as an effective anti-pediculosis medicine which is biocompatible and has high potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Haghighizadeh", "ForeName": "Atoosa", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mortezanejad", "ForeName": "Seyedeh Azadeh Fallah", "Initials": "SAF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dadpour", "ForeName": "Saba", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Control, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rajabi", "ForeName": "Omid", "Initials": "O"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "IRCT", "AccessionNumberList": ["IRCT2017100936672N1"]}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "10032123994", "Agency": "Vice-chancellor for research, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Rev Recent Clin Trials", "NlmUniqueID": "101270873", "ISSNLinking": "1574-8871"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Olive Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "509F88P9SZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Permethrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lice Infestations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Olive Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pediculus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Permethrin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34856913", "10.2174/1574887116666211202122132", "RRCT-EPUB-119203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
