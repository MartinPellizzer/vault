One of the remarked examples is the potential contribution of BVOCs released by urban plants to the generation of ground-level ozone and SOA. The choice of urban plant species, therefore, is critical for air quality improvement in cities. Understanding the rates of BVOCs emitted from different urban plants and how they change in response to environmental stressors is a prerequisite to making the right decision on plant species selection. Here, we performed a meta-analysis on the selected 159 studies that include 357 species to address this need. We found: (1) 89% of deciduous trees emit the three major types of BVOCs, isoprene, monoterpene, and sesquiterpene, but only do 53% evergreen ones. (2) The main types of BVOCs emission by broad-leaved and coniferous plants differ. Seventy-eight percent of broad-leaved, but only 48% of coniferous trees emit isoprene, whereas 74% of broad-leaved, but 93% of coniferous plants emit monoterpene. (3) The emission rates of isoprene and monoterpene differ significantly among species. (4) The analysis on the 77 species collected in previous studies indicated that the effect of environmental stressors varies by different compounds, and the combined effect is not precisely the same as that of a single factor. Based on the meta-analysis, we further identified a few key knowledge gaps and research priorities. First, more studies on the BVOCs emission and carbon allocation at the tree species level are needed. Second, the combined effects of multiple environmental stresses, especially long-term ones, on BVOC emissions and the mechanisms warrant further research. Third, it is vital to evaluate BVOC-climate interactions on global change. Furthermore, there is little empirical work on the synergies and tradeoffs between BVOC emissions and ecosystem services provision of urban plants, which warrants future investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
