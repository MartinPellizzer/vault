The ozonation of TCP was found to follow a pseudo-first-order reaction. The degradation rates increased with the initial pH, and decreased with initial TCP concentration. 2,6-Dichlorohydroquinone was identified as the major intermediate, indicating that dechlorination and hydroxylation co-occurred during TCP ozonation. A model was proposed to quantitatively predict the pseudo-first-order rate constants under different initial TCP concentration and different initial pH levels. The proposed model can successfully describe the reaction; therefore another practical equation was proposed to predict the TCP removal rate at any detention time, which has high potential for practical applications and reactor design."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Research Centre for Urban Environmental Technology and Management, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hung Hom, Hong Kong. cewchu@polyu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MHS8C5BAUZ", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4,6-trichlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12604080", "10.1016/S0045-6535(02)00318-1", "S0045-6535(02)00318-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
