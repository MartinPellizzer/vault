They mainly include superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, ozone, and nitric oxide and are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. Bilirubin, a cardinal pigment in the bile, has been increasingly investigated to treat cancer, diabetes, ischemia-reperfusion injury, asthma, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Indeed, bilirubin has been shown to eliminate ROS production, so it is now considered as a promising therapeutic agent for ROS-mediated diseases and can be used for the development of antioxidative nanomedicines. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the physiological mechanisms of ROS production and its role in pathological changes and focuses on discussing the antioxidative effects of bilirubin and its application in the experimental studies of nanomedicines. Previous studies have shown that bilirubin was mainly used as a responsive molecule in the microenvironment of ROS overproduction in neoplastic tissues for the development of anticancer nanodrugs; however, it could also exert powerful ROS scavenging activity in chronic inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, bilirubin, as an inartificial ROS scavenger, is expected to be used for the development of nanomedicines against more diseases due to the universality of ROS involvement in human pathological conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macao 999087, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhejie", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macao 999087, China."}], "LastName": "Vong", "ForeName": "Chi Teng", "Initials": "CT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macao 999087, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Caifang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macao 999087, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shiyun", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4555-0076"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan 646000, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3575-9212"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macao 999087, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shengpeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macao 999087, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yitao", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "101197791", "ISSNLinking": "1543-8384"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RFM9X3LJ49", "NameOfSubstance": "Bilirubin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Bilirubin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Nanomedicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Microenvironment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32433886", "10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.0c00337"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
