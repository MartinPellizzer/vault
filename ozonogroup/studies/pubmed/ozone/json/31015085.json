CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SEP was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller adsorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SEP composite was stable and showed an excellent catalytic activity for ozonation. The efficiency of quinoline mineralization in the catalytic ozonation with CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SEP was 90.3%, and this value was 5.4 times higher than that of the uncatalyzed ozonation (16.8%). The quinoline mineralization followed a pseudo first-order kinetics with all the catalysts. The rate constant for the mineralization of quinoline by ozonation in the presence of CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SEP was 0.0885 min<sup>-1</sup>, which was 16.7 times higher than that in ozone alone (0.0053 min<sup>-1</sup>). Radical scavenging tests revealed that hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) were the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the quinoline degradation. In the presence of CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SEP, ozone and hydrogen peroxide were rapidly converted into the ROS. Although neutral and alkaline pH were more beneficial for the quinoline mineralization, CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SEP exhibited significant catalytic activity even under acidic conditions. Meanwhile, five-cycle successive tests suggested that CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SEP was recyclable and hence, stable. Furthermore, the feasibility of the catalytic ozonation for the treatment of biologically treated coking wastewater was evaluated. The catalytic ozonation resulted in 57.81% total organic carbon removal efficiency at 60\u202fmin, which was 2.9 times higher than that in the uncatalyzed ozonation (19.99%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
