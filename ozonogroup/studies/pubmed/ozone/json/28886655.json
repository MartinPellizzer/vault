Experimentally, spectroscopic studies of the highest lying recorded vibrational states combined with the observed negative temperature dependence of the kinetics of oxygen isotope exchange reactions confirm that the reaction is barrierless, consistent with the latest potential energy surfaces. Previously reported potentials based on Davidson-corrected internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) suffer from a spurious reef feature in the entrance channel even when extrapolated towards the complete basis set limit. Here, we report an analysis of comparisons between a variety of electronic structure methods including internally contracted and uncontracted MRCI (with and without Davidson corrections), as well as full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo, fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo, and density matrix renormalization group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri 65409, USA."}], "LastName": "Powell", "ForeName": "Andrew D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan."}], "LastName": "Dattani", "ForeName": "Nikesh S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000225777831"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidade Federal do Esp\u00edrito Santo, Vit\u00f3ria 29075-910, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Spada", "ForeName": "Rene F K", "Initials": "RFK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000220643463"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, 12.228-900 S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Machado", "ForeName": "Francisco B C", "Initials": "FBC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000256563975"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lischka", "ForeName": "Hans", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri 65409, USA."}], "LastName": "Dawes", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28886655", "10.1063/1.4990673"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
