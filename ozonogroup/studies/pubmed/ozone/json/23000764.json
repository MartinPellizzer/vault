The distribution of CTNNAL1 was observed by in situ hybridization; the expression of CTNNAL1 was detected by fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR; the airway resistance was detected in by Buxco pulmonary function analysis system; and the relevance of the expression of CTNNAL1 and the resistance of respiratory tract in rat with airway hyperresponsiveness were analyzed.", "CTNNAL1 was distributed in bronchial epithelial cells, goblet cells, endothelial cells, and the alveolar wall. With the increase of the ozone attack, the expression of CTNNAL1 mRNA gradually reduced, the airway hyperresponsiveness was aggravated, and the airway resistance was increased.", "During airway hyperresponse, the reduction of CTNNAL1 mRNA can increase the airway resistance. There is a negative correlation between the reduction of CTNNAL1 mRNA and the airway hyperresponsiveness.
