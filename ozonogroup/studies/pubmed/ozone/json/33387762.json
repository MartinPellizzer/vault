To better understand their roles in O<sub>3</sub> pollution, a field campaign was conducted at an urban site of Shantou, a coastal city in eastern China, during 7th-29th October 2019. Seven carbonyls were quantified (average\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation: 14.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.05\u00a0ppbv), among which formaldehyde (4.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.02\u00a0ppbv), acetaldehyde (1.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u00a0ppbv), acetone (7.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.10\u00a0ppbv), and methyl ethyl ketone (0.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28\u00a0ppbv) were the most abundant species. Relative incremental reactivity (RIR) analysis indicated that O<sub>3</sub> formation in Shantou was VOC-limited, specifically most sensitive to carbonyls, and formaldehyde showed the largest RIR values in terms of individual species. Budgets of O<sub>3</sub> and RO<sub>x</sub> (OH, HO<sub>2</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub>) radicals were elucidated with a chemical box model. Carbonyls played a vital role in both the primary formation and recycling of the RO<sub>x</sub>; more than 80% of the primary source of HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> came from photolysis of formaldehyde and other oxygenated VOCs. Zero-out sensitivity studies showed that the seven measured carbonyls accounted for 37% of the peak net O<sub>3</sub> production rate, mainly by affecting the concentrations of HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub>. These results highlight the significance of carbonyls, especially formaldehyde, to photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation, and carbonyls should be paid more attention to mitigate the worsening O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
