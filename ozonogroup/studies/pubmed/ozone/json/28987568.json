However, controversy remains regarding the relationship between ambient multiple daily ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) metrics and cardiopulmonary health outcomes, especially in the developing countries.", "To investigate and compare the short-term effects of various O<sub>3</sub> metrics on pulmonary function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and BP in a panel study of COPD patients.", "We measured pulmonary function, FeNO and BP repeatedly in a total of 43 patients with COPD for 215 home visits. Daily hourly ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were obtained from central-monitoring stations close to subject residences. We calculated various O<sub>3</sub> metrics [daily 1-h maximum (O<sub>3</sub>-1\u00a0h max), maximum 8-h average (O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h max) and 24-h average (O<sub>3</sub>-24\u00a0h avg)] based on the hourly data. Daily indoor O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were estimated based on estimated indoor/outdoor O<sub>3</sub> ratios. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate associations of various O<sub>3</sub> metrics with cardiopulmonary function variables.", "An interquartile range (IQR) increase in ambient O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h max (80.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 5-d) was associated with a 5.9% (95%CI:\u00a0-11.0%,\u00a0-0.7%) reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and a 6.2% (95%CI:\u00a0-10.9%,\u00a0-1.5%) reduction in peak expiratory flow (PEF). However, there were no significant negative associations between ambient O<sub>3</sub>-1\u00a0h max, O<sub>3</sub>-24\u00a0h avg and FEV<sub>1</sub>, PEF. An IQR increase in ambient O<sub>3</sub>-1\u00a0h max (85.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 6-d) was associated with a 6.7\u00a0mmHg (95%CI: 0.7, 12.7) increase in systolic BP.

No significant associations were found between various O<sub>3</sub> metrics and FeNO.", "Our results provide clues for the adverse cardiopulmonary effects associated with various O<sub>3</sub> metrics in COPD patients and highlight that O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h max was more closely associated with respiratory health variables."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
