X-ray diffraction (XRD), N<sub>2</sub> adsorption desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations revealed that Fe existed in the framework of MCM-48, and Fe-MCM-48 possessed a large surface area and a highly ordered cubic mesoporous structure, which could accelerate reactants and products diffusion. Regarding mineralization efficiency, the addition of Fe-MCM-48 significantly improved total organic carbon (TOC) removal, and approximately 49.9% TOC were removed through the Fe-MCM-48/O<sub>3</sub> process at 60\u202fmin, which was 2.0 times higher than that in single ozonation. Due to this catalyst's superior structure, Fe-MCM-48 showed the better catalytic activity compared with Fe-MCM-41 and Fe loaded MCM-48 (Fe/MCM-48, Fe existed on the surface of MCM-48). DCF removal in the Fe-MCM-48/O<sub>3</sub> process was primarily based on ozone direct oxidation. The improvement of mineralization efficiency was attributed to the function of generated hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), which indicated that the presence of Fe-MCM-48 accelerated ozone decomposition. Moreover, the negatively charged surface of Fe-MCM-48 and the proper pH value of the DCF solution played an essential role in OH generation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
