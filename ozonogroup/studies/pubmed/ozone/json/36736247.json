In this study, bench- and full-scale tests were conducted on a secondary treated effluent at the Eastern Treatment Plant (ETP) of Melbourne Water to probe the performance of ozonation in removing CoC in a wastewater discharge. From the secondary treated effluent as the feed to the ozone process, 58 organic chemicals were measured out of a possible 949 compounds by using the AIQS-DB analytical method. A chemical credit framework for the ozonation process has been established according to the bench-scale results. Chemical classifications based on the chemical structures (aromatics, aliphatic and halogenated aliphatic compounds) and reaction rate constants with O<sub>3</sub> (K<sub>O3</sub>) and the \u2219OH radical (K<sub>\u2219OH</sub>) and a combined O<sub>3</sub>/TOC ratio and O<sub>3</sub> CT value as operating parameters were confirmed to be useful and important in determining whether a chemical would be removed by ozone. It is shown that an O<sub>3</sub>/TOC ratio of >0.404 was shown to be necessary to overcome the instantaneous ozone demand (IOD) to guarantee enough ozone to oxidise CoC. For CoC with K<sub>O3</sub> >10<sup>5</sup>M\u00a0<sup>-</sup>\u00a0<sup>1</sup>s\u00a0<sup>-</sup>\u00a0<sup>1</sup> and K<sub>\u2219OH</sub> >10<sup>9</sup>M\u00a0<sup>-</sup>\u00a0<sup>1</sup>s\u00a0<sup>-</sup>\u00a0<sup>1</sup>, an O<sub>3</sub>/TOC ratio of \u22650.461 or a measurable O<sub>3</sub> CT of \u22650.063\u00a0mg min/L can achieve log reduction values (LRVs) of \u22651, these are chemicals with aromatic structures; For CoC with low K<sub>O3</sub> and high K<sub>OH</sub>, a combined O<sub>3</sub>/TOC ratio and O<sub>3</sub> CT value inclusive of a chemical structure classification is indicated as necessary criteria to evaluate the removal. UV<sub>254</sub> and TOC were demonstrated to be good online surrogates of ozone barrier performance in the absence of continuous O<sub>3</sub>/TOC ratio and O<sub>3</sub> CT value measurements. Full-scale operational results confirm the effective predictions of the chemical credit framework, which highlights the necessity and importance of monitoring both the O<sub>3</sub>/TOC ratio and O<sub>3</sub> CT values to predict the removal efficiency of a given chemical with a known response to O<sub>3</sub> or a known chemical structure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2023.
