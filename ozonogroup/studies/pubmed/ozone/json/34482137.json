Low remediation efficiencies have been reported as a consequence of the reversibility of the transport processes when no power is applied to the electrodes, due to the intermittent powering of renewable sources. However, it has been missed a deeper evaluation from the environmental point of view. This work goes further and seeks to quantify, using life cycle assessment tools, the environmental impacts related to the electro-kinetic treatments powered by different sources: grid (Spanish energy mix), photovoltaic and wind sources. The global warming potential and the ozone depletion showed higher environmental impacts in case of using green energies, associated with the manufacturing of the energy production devices. In contrast to that, results pointed out the lowest water consumption for the treatment powered with solar panels. The huge water requirements to produce energy, considering a Spanish energy mix, drop the sustainability of this powering strategy in terms of water footprint. Regarding toxicities, the pollutant toxicity was highly got rid of after 15\u00a0days of treatment, regardless the powering source used. Nevertheless, the manufacturing of energy and green energy production devices has a huge impact into the toxicity of the remediation treatments, increasing massively the total toxicity of the process, being this effect less prominent by the electro-kinetic treatment solar powered. In view of the overall environmental impact assessed, according to mid and endpoint impact categories, it can be claimed that, despite the high energy requirements and affectation to the global warming potential, the use of solar power is a more sustainable alternative to remediate polluted soils by electrochemical techniques."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
