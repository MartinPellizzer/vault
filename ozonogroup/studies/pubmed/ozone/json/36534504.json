In this work, the OH radical-initiated oxidation of a hydrofluoroolefin, HFO-1234zc, and subsequent reaction of favorable intermediates with other reactive species, such as O<sub>2</sub>, HO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> (<i>x</i> = 1-2) radicals, were studied, and the role of mineral dust in the form of silicate clusters on the reaction mechanism and rate constant was studied. In the gas phase, OH radical addition to HFO-1234zc is kinetically more favorable than the H-atom abstraction reaction. The calculated reaction energy barrier and thermochemical parameters show that both the initial reactions are more feasible on silicate clusters. Thus, silicates can act as chemical sinks for trapping of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). It is found that both gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions are responsible for the transformation of HFOs into fluorinated compounds in the atmosphere. Further, the results show that the ozone creation potential of HFO-1234zc is low, and few of the products are harmful to aquatic organisms. This study provides new insights on the formation of toxic pollutants from the oxidation of HFO-1234zc, which may have significant implications in the troposphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore641 046, India."}], "LastName": "Manonmani", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9055-096X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research, New Delhi110012, India."}], "LastName": "Sandhiya", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3420-8163"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore641 046, India."}], "LastName": "Senthilkumar", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36534504", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c03229"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
