The analysis of their shape permits the correction of our measurements for experimental biases. In particular, a negative correlation is found between the skew of the histograms and the intensity of the backscattered light. The skew comes from a tail at high sampled values, interpreted as due to a raise of the relative contribution to the signal of a signal-induced noise when this intensity diminishes. By fitting a Gaussian function to the histograms without considering their tails, we calculate average signals unbiased by the corresponding noise. This approach allows us to increase the range of our ozone profiles, up to as much as double it in some cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shot per Shot Lidar Group, Laboratory for Air and Soil Pollution, Ecole Polytechnique Federal Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fiorani", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calpini", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaquet", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van den Bergh", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Durieux", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18259556", "10.1364/ao.36.006857", "42729"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
