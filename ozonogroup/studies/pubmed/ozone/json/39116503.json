Despite its promising prospects, the commercialization of fusion faces several challenges, including high temperature, pressure, plasma stability, fuel supply, costs, etc. It is important to effectively analyze material behavior under plasma conditions, especially in environments where fusion reactions produce high-energy particles such as neutrons. This study investigates the angle-dependent neutron production mechanisms of proton-induced reactions involving the isotopes <sup>90</sup>Zr, <sup>91</sup>Zr and <sup>115</sup>In, which are widely used in fusion reactor materials. Using the Monte Carlo codes PHITS 3.32 and FLUKA, as well as the TALYS 1.96 code, double differential cross-section calculations for neutron emission were performed considering various angles. The research contributes to a broader understanding of fusion processes by providing insights into the behavior of these isotopes under proton-induced reactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
