However, sustainability problems usually have a broader scope than socio-technical systems and therefore, require additional considerations. This requires a fuller integration of complex systems understanding into the systems analysis toolset currently available to human factors and ergonomics. In this paper, we outline these complex systems requirements necessary to tackle global problems such as sustainability and then assess how three common systems analysis tools (i.e. Accimap, System Theoretic Accident Mapping and Processes, and Cognitive Work Analysis) stand up against these revised criteria. This assessment is then further explored through applying two of these tools (i.e. Accimap and System Theoretic Accident Mapping and Processes) to a transnational food integrity system problem. This case study shows that no single systems analysis method can be used in isolation to help identify key insights for intervention and that new methods may need to be developed or existing methods need to be adapted to understand these dynamic, adaptive systems. The implications for the further development of systems analysis tools are discussed. <b>Practitioner summary:</b> We assess the applicability of existing human factors and ergonomics systems-analysis tools for examining global problems and for identifying points to intervene in these systems. We comment on what extensions and further work will be required to enable human factors and ergonomics to intervene effectively. <b>Abbreviations:</b> HFE: human factors and ergonomics; CO2: carbon dioxide; CO: carbon monoxide; O3: ozone; SSoS: sustainable system-of-systems; BSE: bovine spongiform encephalopathy; STAMP: systems-theoretic accident model; CWA: cognitive work analysis; WDA: work domain analysis; ConTA: control task analysis; StrA: strategies analysis; SOCA: social and organisation cooperation analysis; SOCA-CAT: social and organisation cooperation analysis contextual analysis template; SOCA-DL: social and organisation cooperation analysis decision ladder; WOP: work organisation possibilities; FRAM: functional resonance analysis method; US FDA: United States Food and Drug Administration; UK: United Kingdom; NET-HARMS: networked hazard analysis and risk management system; PreMiSTS: predicting malfunctions in socio-technical systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychology Department, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5342-980X"], "LastName": "Thatcher", "ForeName": "Andrew", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, Oxford University, Oxford, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Rounaq", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Design School, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waterson", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ergonomics", "NlmUniqueID": "0373220", "ISSNLinking": "0014-0139"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ergonomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Systems Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31327300", "10.1080/00140139.2019.1646925"]}}]}
