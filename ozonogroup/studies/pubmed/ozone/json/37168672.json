Such top-down estimates, while important for oil and gas (O&G) emissions globally, are particularly relevant for Canadian oil sands (OS) operations, which represent the largest O&G contributor to national GHG emissions. We present a multifaceted top-down approach for estimating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that combines aircraft-measured CO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub>x</sub> emission ratios (ERs) with inventory and satellite-derived NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and apply it to the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) in Alberta, Canada. Historical CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were reconstructed for the surface mining region, and average top-down estimates were found to be >65% higher than facility-reported, bottom-up estimates from 2005 to 2020. Higher top-down vs. bottom-up emissions estimates were also consistently obtained for individual surface mining and in situ extraction facilities, which represent a growing category of energy-intensive OS operations. Although the magnitudes of the measured discrepancies vary between facilities, they combine such that the observed reporting gap for total AOSR emissions is \u2265(31 \u00b1 8)\u2005Mt for each of the last 3 years (2018-2020). This potential underestimation is large and broadly highlights the importance of continued review and refinement of bottom-up estimation methodologies and inventories. The ER method herein offers a powerful approach for upscaling measured facility-level or regional fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by taking advantage of satellite remote sensing observations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Crown copyright 2023."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7895-4814"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wren", "ForeName": "Sumi N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "McLinden", "ForeName": "Chris A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4849-9125"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Griffin", "ForeName": "Debora", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7628-6581"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shao-Meng", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Cober", "ForeName": "Stewart G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Darlington", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Hayden", "ForeName": "Katherine", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Mihele", "ForeName": "Cristian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Mittermeier", "ForeName": "Richard L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wheeler", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Flight Research Laboratory, National Research Council Canada Aerospace Research Centre, Ottawa, ON K1V 1J8, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wolde", "ForeName": "Mengistu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3683-4595"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Liggio", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "PNAS Nexus", "NlmUniqueID": "9918367777906676", "ISSNLinking": "2752-6542"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "IPCC Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis .
