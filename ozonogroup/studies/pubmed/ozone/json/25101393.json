The Navy asked the National Research Council (NRC) to review the toxicity data on HFC-134a and to recommend 1-hr and 24-hr emergency exposure guidance levels (EEGLs) and 90-day continuous exposure guidance levels (CEGLs). The Air Force requested the NRC to review the adequacy of the 1-min EEGL proposed by the Air Force for HCFC-123. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested the NRC to review the suitability of current methods for detecting and quantifying the risk of cardiac sensitization from exposure to CFCs and their substitutes. The NRC assigned these tasks to its Committee on Toxicology, which established the Subcommittee to Review Toxicity of Alternatives to Chlorofluorocarbons. The subcommittee reviewed the toxicity data on the two CFC substitutes and the assessment protocol for cardiac sensitization. This report is intended to aid the Navy, the Air Force, and EPA in using CFC substitutes safely."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1996 by the National Academy of Sciences.
