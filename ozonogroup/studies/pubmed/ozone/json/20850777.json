The animals were divided into four equal groups: sham operation, I/R, I/R+HBO and I/R+O(3). One session of 60 min, 3 ATA, 3-4 L/min, 100% oxygenation was defined as one dose of HBO. First dose of HBO was administrated 72 h before ischemia. Subsequent, one-dose of HBO administrated per 12 hours until ischemia time (total seven doses); 0.7 mg/kg ozone/oxygen mixture intraperitoneally was defined as one dose of ozone. First dose of O(3) was administered 72 h before ischemia (total four doses). I/R model was induced in anesthetized rats by unilateral (right) femoral artery clipping for 2 h followed by 22 h of reperfusion. The right tibia and were harvested. Tissue was assayed for levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px).", "MDA and PCO levels were increased in I/R group. SOD activity was increased; GSH-Px activity was decreased in I/R group. MDA and PCO levels were decreased, SOD and GSH-Px activities were increased in both HBO+I/R and O(3)+I/R groups.", "It has been shown that levels of MDA and PCO in bone were increased followed by 2 h of ischemia and 22 h of reperfusion period. Ozone-PC and HBO-PC has protective effect against skeletal bone I/R injury by decreasing levels of MDA and PCO, increasing activities of SOD and GSH-Px in rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.
