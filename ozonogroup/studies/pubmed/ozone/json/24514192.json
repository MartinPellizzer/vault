The results were obtained by analyzing ground measurements by multichannel moderate-bandwidth filter instruments for the period July 2008-September 2010, and radiative transfer modeling was used to aid the interpretation of the results. The highest UVI of 20.6 was measured in Tingri (28.7\u00b0N; 4335\u00a0m). For July, monthly mean UVI values were 14.5 and 12.9 in Tingri and Lhasa (29.7\u00b0N; 3683\u00a0m), respectively. Generally, the UVI levels in Tingri and Lhasa were higher than in Nagchu (31.5\u00b0N; 4510\u00a0m) and Linzhi (29.7\u00b0N; 2995\u00a0m), due to less cloud cover at the former two sites. In 2009, the annual mean UVI and RMF values were 6.8 and 0.7 for Linzhi, 8.8 and 0.92 for Lhasa, 10.5 and 0.92 for Tingri, and 6.7 and 0.7 for Nagchu. Radiative transfer simulations indicate that the latitude difference would correspond to an increase in the UVI of about 0.3 from Nagchu to Tingri; whereas, the altitude difference would correspond to a reduction of about 1.5%, implying that the observed difference is due to the difference in cloud cover. The annual mean TOC values were found to be 260-264 Dobson units (DU) in Lhasa, Linzhi, and Nagchu, and 252 DU in Tingri. TOC values in Lhasa were found to agree within 3% with those derived from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Norsang", "ForeName": "Gelsor", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pingcuo", "ForeName": "Nima", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dahlback", "ForeName": "Arne", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Frette", "ForeName": "\u00d8yvind", "Initials": "\u00d8"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kjeldstad", "ForeName": "Berit", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamre", "ForeName": "B\u00f8rge", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stamnes", "ForeName": "Knut", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stamnes", "ForeName": "Jakob J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24514192", "10.1364/AO.53.000736", "277932"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
