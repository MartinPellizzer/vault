Using only observed VOC mixing ratios to assess VOC pollution, is therefore problematic. The observed mixing ratios and initial mixing ratios taking chemical loss into consideration were performed using data for 90 VOCs in the atmosphere in a typical urban area in Beijing in winter 2013 to gain a more accurate view of VOC pollution. The VOC sources, ambient VOC mixing ratios and compositions, variability and influencing factors, contributions to near-ground-ozone and health risks posed were assessed. Source apportionment should be conducted using initial mixing ratios, but health risks should be assessed using observed mixing ratios. The daytime daily mean initial mixing ratio (72.62ppbv) was 7.72ppbv higher than the daytime daily mean observed mixing ratio (64.90ppbv). Alkenes contributed >70% of the consumed VOCs. The nighttime daily mean observed mixing ratio was 71.66ppbv, 6.76ppbv higher than the daytime mixing ratio. The observed mixing ratio for 66 VOCs was 40.31% higher in Beijing than New York. The OFPs of Ini-D (266.54ppbv) was underestimated 23.41% compared to the OFP of Obs-D (204.14ppbv), improving emission control of ethylene and propene would be an effective way of controlling O<sub>3</sub>. Health risk assessments performed for 28 hazardous VOCs show that benzene, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, and acetaldehyde pose carcinogenic risk and acrolein poses non-carcinogenic risks. Source apportionment results indicated that vehicle exhausts, solvent usage and industrial processes were the main VOC source during the study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
