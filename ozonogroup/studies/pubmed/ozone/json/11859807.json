Then the strain was added to the L\u00f6wenstein-Jesen solid medium containing different concentrations of antituberculous agents. Following 3 weeks, drug sensitivity was determined by the number of grown colonies. Then MBT were retreated with PO3 in the same fashion, by repeating the cycle three times. At week 3, a growth of over 100 colonies was recorded in all control cultures. After each PO3 treatment of the strain, there was a reduction in its resistance to I and R. After triple treatment, MBT sensitivity to I completely recovered. In the R-containing media, there was also decrease in drug resistance, but the latter remained high (640 mu/ml). S resistance substantially lowered after the second PO3 treatment, but it restored after the third one. A mechanism responsible for lower MBT resistance to I and R under the action of \"therapeutical\" concentrations of PO3 is analyzed. The paper discusses whether MBT resistance can be changes at the phenotypic level rather that at the genetic one."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belianin", "ForeName": "I I", "Initials": "II"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martynova", "ForeName": "L P", "Initials": "LP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shmelev", "ForeName": "E I", "Initials": "EI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Izmenenie usto\u012dchivosti k izoniazidu i rifampitsinu poliresistentnogo shtamma mikobakteri\u012d tuberkuleza posle obrabotki rastvorennym ozonom."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Probl Tuberk", "NlmUniqueID": "0414141", "ISSNLinking": "0032-9533"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V83O1VOZ8L", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoniazid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VJT6J7R4TR", "NameOfSubstance": "Rifampin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Isoniazid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Rifampin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11859807"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
