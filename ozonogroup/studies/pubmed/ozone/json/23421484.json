Symptoms and pulmonary function test (PFT) were measured before and immediately after exposure. Six hours after exposure, induced sputum was collected. Patients were evaluated according to their functional (FEV\u2081 responders) or neutrophilic (neutrophil responders) response to ozone. We considered, as possible predictors of response: age, baseline FEV\u2081, previous treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), baseline sputum neutrophils, baseline sputum eosinophils, methacholine responsiveness, atopy and smoking habit.", "FEV\u2081 responders had lower baseline FEV\u2081, and a lower percentage of these had received ICS treatment. Neutrophil responders were younger, with lower baseline sputum inflammation and greater methacholine responsiveness. These results were confirmed by multivariate logistic analysis.", "Patients not previously treated with ICS and patients with lower FEV\u2081 are more prone to functional response to ozone. Lower baseline airway inflammation and greater bronchial hyperresponsiveness may predict neutrophilic airway response to ozone in asthmatic patients. Thus, determinants of functional and inflammatory responses to ozone are different."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Department, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. m.bartoli@ao-pisa.toscana.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bartoli", "ForeName": "Maria Laura", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vagaggini", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malagrin\u00f2", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bacci", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cianchetti", "ForeName": "Silvana", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dente", "ForeName": "Federico L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Novelli", "ForeName": "Federica", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paggiaro", "ForeName": "Pierluigi", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Sputum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23421484", "10.3109/08958378.2013.763313"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
