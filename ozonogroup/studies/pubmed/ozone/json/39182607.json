As a major initial point of defense, airway lipids react to inhaled contaminants such as volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, or ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), creating lipokine signaling that is crucial for both the initiation and resolution of inflammation within the lung. Dietary modulation of eicosanoids has gained increased attention in recent years for improvements to cardiovascular health. The current study sought to examine how dietary supplementation with eicosanoid precursors (i.e., oils rich in saturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids) might alter the lung lipid composition and subsequently modify the inflammatory response to ozone inhalation. Our study demonstrated that mice fed a diet high in saturated fatty acids resulted in diet-specific changes to lung lipid profiles and increased cellular recruitment to the lung following ozone inhalation. Bioinformatic analysis revealed an ozone-dependent upregulation of several lipid species, including phosphoserine 37:5. Pathway analysis of lipid species revealed the process of lateral diffusion of lipids within membranes to be significantly altered due to ozone exposure. These results show promising data for influencing pulmonary lipidomic profiles via diet, which may provide a pragmatic therapeutic approach to protect against lung inflammation and damage following pulmonary insult."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
