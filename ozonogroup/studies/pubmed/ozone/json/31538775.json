The detection of GLY provides useful indicators of fast photochemistry occurring in the lower troposphere. The fast and sensitive detection of GLY is thus important, while traditional chemical ionization such as the proton-transfer reaction (PTR) is extremely limited by the poor detection limit and extensive fragmentation. To address these limitations, electron attachment reaction (EAR) ionization was applied to detect GLY. The generation of parent anions (GLY<sup>-</sup>) without fragmentation was observed, and cryogenic photoelectron imaging spectroscopy further characterized the structure of GLY<sup>-</sup>. The detection limit was estimated to be as low as (52 \u00b1 1) pptv (parts per trillion by volume) with 1 min measurements. Other components in ambient air, such as water, carbon dioxide, and trace gases (acetone, propanal, etc.) have no effect on the detection of GLY. The EAR ionization is more promising than PTR ionization in detecting GLY. The detection of GLY in ambient air by the EAR ionization has been demonstrated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species , Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190 , P.
