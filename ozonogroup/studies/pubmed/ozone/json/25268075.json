The effect of different parameters on the degradation efficiency of atrazine was investigated, and the degradation mechanism of atrazine was studied. The experimental results showed that when the discharge power was 50 W and the air flow rate was 140 L h(-1), 93.7% of atrazine was degraded after 18 min of discharge time. The concentrations of generated O3 and H2O2 increased with increasing discharge time. The pH decreased from 6.80 to 2.50, 12.7% of TOC was removed after 18 min. The concentrations of generated Cl(-) and NO3(-) increased significantly during the degradation process of atrazine, and the decreasing toxicity trend was observed for the treated atrazine solution. The degradation byproducts of atrazine were identified using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS), which might be formed mainly in dechlorination hydroxylation, alkyl oxidation, dechlorination hydroxylation combined with alkyl oxidation and demethylation oxidation reactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
