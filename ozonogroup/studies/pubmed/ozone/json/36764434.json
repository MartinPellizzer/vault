The incidence and prevalence of major autoimmune conditions are particularly high in the western world, at northern latitudes, and in industrialized countries. This study will mainly focus on five major autoimmune conditions, namely type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune thyroid disorders. Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests a protective role of sunlight exposure on the etiology of major autoimmune conditions mediated by the endogenous production of vitamin D and nitric oxide. A historical perspective shows how the rise of anthropogenic air pollutants is temporally associated with dramatic increases in incidence of these conditions. The scattering caused by ambient particulate matter and the presence of tropospheric ozone can reduce the endogenous production of vitamin D and nitric oxide, which are implicated in maintaining the immune homeostasis. Air pollutants have direct detrimental effects on the human body and are deemed responsible of an increasingly higher portion of the annual burden of human morbidity and mortality. Air pollution contributes in systemic inflammation, activates oxidative pathways, induces epigenetic alterations, and modulates the function and phenotype of dendritic cells, Tregs, and T-cells. In this review, we provide epidemiological and mechanistic insights regarding the role of UV-mediated effects in immunity and how anthropic-derived air pollution may affect major autoimmune conditions through direct and indirect mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
