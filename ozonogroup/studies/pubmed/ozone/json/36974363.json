We investigated associations between the use of GLP-1 RAs and other antidiabetic medications (non-GLP-1 RAs) and the risk of sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction (40% reduction compared with baseline for 4 months) for KTRs with type 2 diabetes. We calculated the propensity score of initiating GLP-1 RAs compared with that of initiating non-GLP-1 RAs as a function of baseline covariates using logistic regression. The inverse probability of the treatment-weighted odds ratio was estimated to control for baseline confounding variables. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use was a competing event. The primary outcome was sustained eGFR reduction of at least 40% from baseline for 4 months post-transplantation.", "Seventy-three patients were GLP-1 RA users and 73 were non-GLP-1 RA users. Six patients and 1 patient in the non-GLP-1 RA and GLP-1 RA groups had sustained eGFR reduction. GLP-1 RA use after KTX was associated with a lower risk of sustained eGFR reduction.", "GLP-1 RAs resulted in lower eGFR reduction compared with non-GLP-1 RAs and may contribute to better kidney graft survival after KTX."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
