High chemical oxygen demand, dye, heavy metals, toxic organic and non-biodegradable compounds present in petroleum industry wastewater. This study intends to optimize the photocatalytic proxone process, utilizing a synthesized ZnO-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocatalyst, for petroleum wastewater treatment. The synthesis of ZnO-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was done by air oxidation and layer-by-layer self-assembly method and XRD, SEM, EDAX, FT-IR, BET, DRS, and VSM techniques were used to characterize the catalyst. Central composite design (CCD) method applied to investigated the effect of pH (4-8), reaction time (30-60\u00a0min), ozone gas concentration (1-2\u00a0mg/L-min), hydrogen peroxide concentration (2-3\u00a0mL/L) and the amount of catalyst (1-0.5\u00a0g/L) on the process. In the optimal conditions, biological oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>) and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal, reaction kinetic, and synergistic effect mechanisms on the process were studied. Based on the ANOVA, a quadratic model with R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.99, P-Value\u2009=\u20090.0001, and F-Value\u2009=\u2009906.87 was proposed to model the process. Based on the model pH\u2009=\u20095.7, ozone concentration\u2009=\u20091.8\u00a0mg/L-min, hydrogen peroxide concentration\u2009=\u20092.5\u00a0mL/L, reaction time\u2009=\u200956 min, and the catalyst dose\u2009=\u20090.7\u00a0g/L were proposed as the optimum condition. According to the model prediction, an efficiency of 85.3% was predicted for the removal of COD. To evaluate the accuracy of the prediction, an experiment was carried out in optimal conditions, and experimentally, a 52% removal efficiency was obtained. Also, at the optimum condition, BOD<sub>5</sub> and TPH removal were 91.1% and 89.7% respectively. The reaction kinetic follows the pseudo-first-order kinetic model (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.98). Also, the results showed that there is a synergistic effect in this process. As an advanced hybrid oxidation process, the photocatalytic proxone process has the capacity to treat petroleum wastewater to an acceptable standard."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
