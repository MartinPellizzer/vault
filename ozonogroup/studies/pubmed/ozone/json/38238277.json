The patients were randomly placed into two groups with sample size estimated as <i>n</i> = 20 in each group. Group A: Control: patients received only saline irrigation and group B: patients receiving topical ozone gel. The surgical procedure was standardized for all groups, and local anesthesia was used during the procedure. After the removal of the mandibular third molar, the control group irrigated the socket with saline, whereas in the study group, the socket was filled with ozone gel. On the first, third, fifth, and seventh postoperative days, a single examiner evaluated each participant for postoperative mouth opening, discomfort, and patient satisfaction. The <i>t</i>-test was used to analyze quantitative data, whereas the Fisher exact test was employed to analyze qualitative data. Statistical significance was defined as a <i>p</i> value less than 0.05.", "On comparison of patient satisfaction, in the ozone gel group, 13 patients were very satisfied but in the control group, 8 patients were very satisfied. On comparison of pain intensity, on the 5th day, the complete absence of pain patients was more in the ozone gel group (12 patients) compared with the control group (4 patients). There was a statistically significant difference found between these two groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). On comparison of mouth opening, on the 3rd and 5th day, mouth opening was better in the ozone gel group (29.22 \u00b1 1.28 and 34.06 \u00b1 0.09) compared with the control group (27.38 \u00b1 1.03 and 31.14 \u00b1 0.82), respectively. And there was a statistically significant difference found between these two groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001) on both the days.", "The current study came to the conclusion that using ozone gel significantly improves postoperative pain, mouth opening range, and promotes faster wound healing.", "The primary goals of postoperative care for exodontia patients have always been pain management and infection control. The most frequent postoperative consequences are pain and edema. Hence, ozone therapy can be used as an effective topical agent to manage postextraction pain and swelling in healthy patients without the need for excess medications.
