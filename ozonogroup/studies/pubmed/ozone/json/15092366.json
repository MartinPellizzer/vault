This study examines the role of arginine decarboxylase (ADC), an important rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, in barley plants exposed to ozone (O(3)). The activity of ADC increased significantly in O(3)-treated leaves when visible injury was hardly apparent. The increase in ADC activity may be a mechanism to increase the PA levels in O(3)-treated leaves and so minimize the damaging effects of O(3). Supporting this, foliar applications of DL-alpha-difluoromethylarginine (DFMA), a specific inhibitor of ADC, prevented the rise in ADC activity and visible injury was considerable on exposure to O(3). This damage was not due to the foliar sprays, as little visible injury was seen in leaves in the O(3)-free controls. The results are discussed in terms of the roles of PA in conferring O(3) resistance in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, Lancashire LA1 4YQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rowland-Bamford", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borland", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lea", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansfield", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092366", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90030-4", "0269-7491(89)90030-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
