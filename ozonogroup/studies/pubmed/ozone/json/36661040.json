A generalized additive Poisson model was applied to examine the associations between the concentrations of air pollutants and daily outpatient visits for ILI when controlling meteorological factors and temporal trend.\u00a0A total of 171\u2009943 ILI patients were included. In the pre-coronavirus disease 2019\u00a0(COVID-19) stage, an increased risk of ILI outpatient visits was associated to a high air quality index (AQI) and the high concentrations of particulate matter less than 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub> ), particulate matter 10 (PM<sub>10</sub> ), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub> ), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ), and carbon monoxide (CO), and a low concentration of ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) on lag0 day and lag1 day, while a higher increased risk of ILI outpatient visits was observed by the air pollutants in the COVID-19 stage on lag0 day. Except for PM<sub>10</sub> , the concentrations of other air pollutants on lag1 day were not significantly associated with an increased risk of ILI outpatient visits during the COVID-19
