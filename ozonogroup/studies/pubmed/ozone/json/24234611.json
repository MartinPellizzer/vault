Recent spectroscopic measurements on industrial aluminium smelters found typical CO/COS ratios between 80 and 200. This results in specific COS emissions of between 1 and 7 kg/t(Al) if all COS is released into the atmosphere. In 1993 aluminium production would have been responsible for between 0.02 and 0.14 Tg of COS emissions. Currently, aluminium production does not seem to influence the total atmospheric COS budget to an extent beyond its natural variability. If recent growth rates of global aluminium production are sustained, however, COS emissions would quadruple until 2030. Together with increasing aircraft emissions into the stratosphere, an increase of the sulfate background aerosol is to be expected that could significantly enhance ozone depletion. The use of inert anodes is recommended to reduce aluminium production emissions of COS and CF4, C2F6, CO2, and CO at the same time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Aeronomie, Postfach 20, D-37189, Kaltenburg-Lindau, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harnisch", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borchers", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabian", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kourtidis", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24234611", "10.1007/BF02987529"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
