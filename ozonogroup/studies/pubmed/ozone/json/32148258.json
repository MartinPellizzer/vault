There are no published papers in the literature on the removal of this type of insecticides through these associated oxidation processes. Single oxidation processes did not achieve total pollutants removal in less than 3\u00a0h (only UV radiation treatment obtain a total removal of Thiamethoxan in 150\u00a0min, but with mineralization below 15% TOC). For double sequential processes, Electro-oxidation-Ozone treatment obtains a total removal of Imidacloprid in 120\u00a0min and an increase of mineralization to 50% TOC. Three or four sequential processes are recommended to improve degradation and mineralization rates in a significant way, Electro-oxidation-Ozone-UV treatment obtains a total removal of Thiamethoxan in 80\u00a0min with mineralization over 75% TOC. These results confirm important synergistic effects which were quantified. The global trend indicates that Thiamethoxam is the most oxidizable neonicotinoid, whereas Acetamiprid is the most recalcitrant compound. The degradation rate of each neonicotinoid followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and the different oxidation pathways were also quantified from a kinetic point of view."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
