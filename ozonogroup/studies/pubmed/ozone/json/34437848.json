We aimed to explore the associations of ambient sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) with MDs hospitalizations in 17 Chinese cities during 2015-2018, and estimate the attributable risk and economic costs of MDs hospitalizations associated with gaseous pollutants. City-specific relationships between gaseous pollutants and MDs hospitalizations were evaluated using over-dispersed generalized additive models, then combined to obtain the pooled effect. Concentration-response (C-R) curves of gaseous pollutants with MDs from each city were pooled to allow regional estimates to be derived. The morbidity and economic burdens of MDs hospitalizations attributable to gaseous pollutants were further assessed. A total of 171,939 MDs hospitalizations were included. We observed insignificant association of O<sub>3</sub> with MDs. An interquartile range increase in SO<sub>2</sub> at lag0 (9.1\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3), NO<sub>2</sub> at lag0 (16.7\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3) and CO at lag2 (0.4\u00a0mg/m\u00b3) corresponded to a 3.02% (95%CI: 0.72%, 5.38%), 5.03% (95%CI: 1.84%, 8.32%) and 2.18% (95%CI: 0.40%, 4.00%) increase in daily MDs hospitalizations, respectively. These effects were modified by sex, season and cause-specific MDs. The C-R curves of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> with MDs indicated nonlinearity and the slops were steeper at lower concentrations. Overall, using current standards as reference concentrations, 0.27% (95%CI: 0.07%, 0.48%) and 0.06% (95%CI: 0.02%, 0.10%) of MDs hospitalizations could be attributable to extra SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposures, and the corresponding economic costs accounted for 0.34% (95%CI: 0.08%, 0.60%) and 0.07% (95%CI: 0.03%, 0.11%) of hospitalization expenses, respectively. Moreover, using threshold values detected from C-R curves as reference concentrations, the above mentioned morbidity and economic burdens increased a lot. These findings suggest more strict emission control regulations are needed to protect mental health from gaseous pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
