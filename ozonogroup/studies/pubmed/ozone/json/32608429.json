The reaction mechanisms of the radical with NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>3</sub> were studied by quantum chemistry calculations at the CCSD(T)/CBS//M06-2X/def2-TZVP level of theory. The explicit potential energy curves were provided in order to reveal the atmospheric fate of the radical comprehensively. The main products of the reaction of with NO are predicted to be , CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. The reaction of with NO<sub>2</sub> is reversible, and its main product would be C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> which was predicted to be more stable than PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate) at room temperature. The decomposition of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> at different ambient temperatures would be a potential long-range transport source of NO<sub>x</sub> in the atmosphere. The predominant products of the reaction are predicted to be C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub>H, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>C(O)OH, O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, while HO\u02d9 is of minor importance. So, the reaction of with would be an important source of ozone and carboxylic acids in the local atmosphere, and has less contribution to the regeneration of HO\u02d9 radicals. The reaction of with NO<sub>3</sub> should mainly produce , CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, which might play an important role in atmospheric chemistry of peroxy radicals at night, but has less contribution to the night-time conversion of ( and RO\u02d9) to ( and HO\u02d9) in the local atmosphere. The results above are in good accordance with the reported experimental observations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Key Laboratory of Cluster Science of Ministry of Education, Beijing Institute of Technology, South Zhongguancun Street # 5, Haidian District, Beijing, 100081, P.
