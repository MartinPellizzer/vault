This research studied the feasibility of using MgO nanoparticles (MgO-NPs) as a catalyst in the ozonation process for removing 2,4-DCP from aqueous environments under laboratory conditions. This study was conducted using a laboratory-scale semi-continuous reactor. It studied the effects of critical variables such as solution pH, ozonation time, dose of MgO-NPs and initial 2,4-DCP concentration. A statistical model of response surface model (RSM) was designed and utilized to obtain the optimum experimental conditions. Analysis of the data showed that initial concentration of 2,4-DCP and dose of MgO-NPs had the maximum effect on the response variable (percentage degradation of 2,4-DCP). Moreover, based on analysis of variance on the model, the optimum removal conditions were reaction time of 50 min, pH > 7, initial 2,4-DCP concentration of less than 50 mg/L, and an MgO-NPs dose of 0.3 mg/L. Under these optimum conditions, a removal efficiency of 99.99% was achieved. In addition, results indicated that catalytic ozonation in the presence of MgO-NPs was very efficient at removing 2,4-DCP from aqueous environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Promotion Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran E-mail: ed_bazrafshan@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Leili", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Promotion Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran E-mail: ed_bazrafshan@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Bazrafshan", "ForeName": "Edris", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Noroozifar", "ForeName": "Meissam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Promotion Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran E-mail: ed_bazrafshan@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Ansari-Moghaddam", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Barahuie", "ForeName": "Farahnaz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Promotion Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran E-mail: ed_bazrafshan@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Balarak", "ForeName": "Davoud", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfonated 2,4-dichlorophenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3A3U0GI71G", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R669TG1950", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-dichlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29210691", "10.2166/wst.2017.479"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
