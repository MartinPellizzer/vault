The results demonstrate the potential of NBs application to O<sub>3</sub> - based AOP. It was observed that NBs suppress the negative influence of pH and operating temperatures on the efficiency of ozonation. In addition, the application of NBs tends to improve the solubility of O<sub>3</sub> and the rate of mass transfer under the influence of a broad range of temperature and pH conditions. The results of this research indicate that application of NBs minimized the reduction in concentration of dissolved O<sub>3</sub> with an increase in temperature. Furthermore, application of NBs highly improved the OH radical formation in acidic conditions. The results of this research depicted for first time that the application of NBs strongly encourages the initiation of reactions involving OH radicals. It was found by this research that NBs can boost the concentration of OH radicals up to 3.5 fold compared to equivalent MB-supported ozonation systems. This is assumed to improve the efficiency of currently existing conventional bubble supported O<sub>3</sub> - based AOP systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Adama Science and Technology university, P.O.Box 1888, Adama, Ethiopia E-mail: tatek.temesgen@astu.edu.et, tate95et@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Temesgen", "ForeName": "Tatek", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Seoul National University, 599 Gwanakro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-744, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Mooyoung", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34928837", "10.2166/wst.2021.475"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
