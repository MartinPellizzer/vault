At regular intervals were determined: gas exchange of the leaves, the internal air space (Vair) and apoplastic water volume (Vapo) and the reduced (ASA) and oxidized (DHA) ascorbate concentration in the apoplast and in the mesophyll cells. The apoplastic ASA-concentration was 0.2 mM at the start of the experiment for both cultivars, while the effective cell wall thickness, estimated from Vapo, varied from 0.3 to 0.6 micron. Model calculations revealed that only 30% of the O3 molecules entering the apoplast was intercepted at these values. The O3-treatment induced a decline in stomatal conductance, an increase in Vapo and in the apoplastic ASA-concentration. As a result the estimated O3-flux to the cell membrane strongly declined. However, these responses occurred after the O3-induced reduction in photosynthesis. Moreover, they did not prevent early senescence of the leaves at a prolonged exposure. Therefore, it is concluded that the increase in apoplastic ASA-concentration was rather a general stress reaction of the affected poplar leaf than a (specific) defence reaction induced by O3. Our results suggest that other factors than the scavenging efficiency of apoplastic ASA were responsible for the difference in O3 sensitivity between both poplar cultivars."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Meteorology and Air Quality Group, Wageningen University, Duivendaal 2, 6701 AP Wageningen, The Netherlands. bert.vanhove@pph.dpw.wag-ur.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Hove", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bossen", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "San Gabino", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sgreva", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Salicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water-Electrolyte Balance"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11584635", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00237-2", "S0269-7491(00)00237-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
