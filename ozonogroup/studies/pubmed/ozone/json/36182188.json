Carbonyl compounds can cause the formation of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and secondary organic aerosols, which can cause photochemical smog to form. In this study, 20 agricultural machines were tested using portable emission measurement system (PEMS) under real-world tillage processes. The exhaust gases were sampled using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridges, and 15 carbonyl compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Carbonyl compound emission factors for agricultural machines were 51.14-3315.62 mg/(kg-fuel), and were 2.58 \u00b1 2.05, 0.86 \u00b1 1.07 and 0.29 \u00b1 0.20 g/(kg-fuel) for China 0, China II and China III emission standards, respectively. Carbonyl compound emission factor for sowing seeds of China 0 agricultural machines was 3.32 \u00b1 1.73 g/(kg-fuel). Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein were the dominant carbonyl compounds emitted. Differences in emission standards and tillage processes impact ozone formation potential (OFP). The mean OFP was 20.15 \u00b1 16.15 g O<sub>3</sub>/(kg-fuel) for the China 0 emission standard. The OFP values decreased by 66.9% from China 0 to China II, and 67.4% from China II to China III. The mean OFP for sowing seeds of China 0 agricultural machines was 25.92 \u00b1 13.84 g O<sub>3</sub>/(kg-fuel). Between 1.75 and 24.22 times more ozone was found to be formed during sowing seeds than during other processes for China 0 and China II agricultural machines. Total carbonyl compound emissions from agricultural machines in China was 19.23 Gg in 2019. The results improve our understanding of carbonyl compound emissions from agricultural machines in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
