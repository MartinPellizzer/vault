Before each exposure, the subjects had been pretreated with either oxidants (fish oil) or antioxidants (multivitamins). The study design was double-blind crossover with randomized allocation to the exposure regime. Full and partial flow-volume curves were recorded in the morning and before and during a histamine provocation at the end of the day. Nasal cavity volume and inflammatory markers in nasal lavage fluid were also measured. Compared with air, ozone exposure decreased peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and forced vital capacity (FVC), with no significant effect from the pretreatment regimens. Ozone decreased the ratio of maximal to partial flow at 40% FVC by 0.08 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SE, analysis of variance: P = 0.018) and at 30% FVC by 0.10 +/- 0.05 (P = 0.070). Ozone exposure did not significantly increase bronchial responsiveness, but, after treatment with fish oil, partial flows decreased more than after vitamins during the histamine test, without changing the maximal-to-partial flow ratio. The decreased effect of a deep inhalation after ozone exposure can be explained by changes in airway hysteresis relative to parenchymal hysteresis, due either to ozone-induced airway inflammation or to less deep inspiration after ozone, not significantly influenced by multivitamins or fish oil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Univ. of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kjaergaard", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedersen", "ForeName": "O F", "Initials": "OF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rasmussen", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00f8lhave", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fish Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fish Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Flow Rates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14688031", "10.1152/japplphysiol.00507.2003", "00507.2003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
