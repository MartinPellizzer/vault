Through inducing oxidization to modify PU surface by ozone, peroxide groups are easily generated on the surface. Those peroxides are broken by redox-polymerization, and provide active species which initiate graft polymerization by reacting with amines in the collagen molecules. The ozone oxidation time and voltage could readily control the amount of peroxide production. The surface density of generated peroxides on PU surface was determined by iodide method. The maximum concentration of peroxide was about 10.20 x 10(-8)mol/cm(2) when ozone oxidation was performed at 60 V for 30 min. After the reaction of PU by ozone oxidation, type I atelocollagen was graft-copolymerized onto the PU film. All the physical measurements on the collagen-grafted surface indicated that the PU surface was effectively covered with type I atelocollagen. The interaction of the collagen-grafted PU surface with fibroblasts could be greatly enhanced by the surface graft polymerization with type I atelocollagen. Attachment and proliferation of fibroblasts on the grafted type I atelocollagen were significantly enhanced, and it is assumed that the atelocollagen matrix supported the initial attachment and growth of cells. In the early stage of proliferation, collagen synthesis in fibroblasts was not activated and remained at a relatively low level due to the grafted type I atelocollagen, increasing only with fibroblast differentiation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Engineering, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 134, Shinchon-dong, Seodaemun-ku, Seoul 120-752, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyon", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biomed Mater Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0112726", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9304"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coated Materials, Biocompatible"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyurethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "atelocollagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coated Materials, Biocompatible"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Elasticity"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Esophagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyurethanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wettability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11033549", "10.1002/1097-4636(20001215)52:4<669::aid-jbm11>3.0.co;2-u", "10.1002/1097-4636(20001215)52:4<669::AID-JBM11>3.0.CO;2-U"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
