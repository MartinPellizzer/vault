There are a number of potential causes for these declines, including those related to environmental changes such as increasing ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion. UV-B radiation can kill amphibian embryos or can cause sublethal effects that can harm amphibians in later life stages. However, amphibians have defenses against UV-B damage that can limit damage or repair it after exposure to UV-B radiation. These include behavioral, physiological, and molecular defenses. These defenses differ interspecifically, with some species more able to cope with exposure to UV-B than others. Unfortunately, the defense mechanisms of many species may not be effective against increasing persistent levels of UV-B radiation that have only been present for the past several decades due to human-induced environmental damage. Moreover, we predict that persistent UV-B-induced mortality and sublethal damage in species without adequate defenses could lead to changes in community structure. In this article we review the effects of UV-B radiation on amphibians and the defenses they use to avoid solar radiation and make some predictions regarding community structure in light of interspecific differences in UV-B tolerance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. blaustea@bcc.orst.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blaustein", "ForeName": "Andrew R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belden", "ForeName": "Lisa K", "Initials": "LK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Evol Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "100883432", "ISSNLinking": "1520-541X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.99.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amphibians"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Repair"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryo, Nonmammalian"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photobiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "75"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12492415", "10.1046/j.1525-142x.2003.03014.x", "ede03014"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
