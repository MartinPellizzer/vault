Treatment with ozone proved to be a suitable method for eliminating such MPs. This method was implemented at the WWTP Aachen-Soers by commissioning the largest full-scale ozonation plant in Europe at the moment. Recently, effect-based methods (EBMs) have been successfully proved for compliance monitoring, e.g. estrogenic compounds. Therefore, the impact of ozone treatment on endocrine potential (agonistic and antagonistic) of treated wastewater was investigated using the ER\u03b1- and AR CALUX assays. Additionally, the impact on the receiving stream and a potential preload of the water body was assessed. Therefore, the current study could deal as a case study for small rivers being highly impacted by WWTPs. The estrogenic potential was nearly fully eliminated after ozone treatment. Contrary, the antagonistic (anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic) potential did not show a clear elimination pattern after ozone treatment independent of the applied ozone dosage and control system. Therefore, further investigations are required regarding the antagonistic potential. Additionally, preloading of the receiving stream was found during the study period. One significant impact is a rain overflow basin (ROB) located upstream of the WWTP effluent. The highest endocrine potential was found after a ROB overflow (2.7\u00a0ng EEQ/L, 2.4\u00a0\u03bcg TMX-EQ/L, 104\u00a0\u03bcg FLU-EQ/L), suggesting that such runoff events after a heavy rainfall may act as a driver of endocrine loading to the water body. This manuscript contributes significantly to the basic understanding of the efficiency of eliminating the endocrine potential of ozone treatment by, e.g., showing that there is a further need for improving the removal efficiency of antagonistic potential. Moreover, it highlights the need to include other point sources, such as ROBs, to assess polluted surface waters comprehensively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
