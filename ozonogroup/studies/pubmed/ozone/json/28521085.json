For that purpose, elastic PDMS substrates were prestretched to a different extent and oxidized in particular areas using a mask. When the stretching was removed, the PDMS substrate exhibited out-of-plane deformations that largely depend on the applied prestretching. Prestretchings below 100% lead to affine deformations in which the treated areas are buckled. On the contrary, prestretchings above \u03b5 >100% prior to surface treatment induce the formation of folded wrinkles on those micrometer-size ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treated areas upon relaxation. As a result, dual periodic wrinkles were formed due to the alternation of highly deformed (folded) and low deformed (buckled) areas. Our strategy is based on the surface treatment at precise positions upon prestretching of the elastic substrate (PDMS). Additionally, this approach can be used to template the formation of wrinkled surfaces by alternating lines of folded wrinkles (valleys) and low-deformed areas (hills). This effect allowed us to precisely tune the shape and distribution of the UVO exposed areas by varying the prestretching direction. Moreover, the wrinkle characteristics, including period and amplitude, exhibit a direct relation to the dimensions of the patterns present in the mask."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Estructura de la Materia, IEM-CSIC , Serrano 121, 28006 Madrid, Spain."}], "LastName": "Nogales", "ForeName": "Aurora", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Cer\u00e1mica y Vidrio (ICV-CSIC) , C/Kelsen 5, 28049 Madrid, Spain."}], "LastName": "Del Campo", "ForeName": "Adolfo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Estructura de la Materia, IEM-CSIC , Serrano 121, 28006 Madrid, Spain."}], "LastName": "Ezquerra", "ForeName": "Tiberio A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2464-1040"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda de Pol\u00edmeros (ICTP-CSIC) , C/Juan de la Cierva 3, 28006 Madrid, Spain."}], "LastName": "Rodriguez-Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28521085", "10.1021/acsami.7b03161"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
