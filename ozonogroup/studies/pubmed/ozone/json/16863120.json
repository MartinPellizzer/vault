We use CBS-QB3 calculations and RRKM/master equation simulations to characterize all the pathways leading to the formation of this species, all the interconversions among its four possible conformers, and all of its irreversible isomerizations. Our calculations, like previous studies, predict (*)OH yields consistent with experiment if thermalized syn-methyl carbonyl oxides form (*)OH quantitatively. Natural bond order analysis reveals that the vinyl group weakens the C=O bond of the carbonyl oxide, making rotation about this bond accessible to this chemically activated intermediate. The vinyl group also allows one conformer of the carbonyl oxide to undergo electrocyclization to form a dioxole, a species not previously considered in the literature. Dioxole formation, which has a CBS-QB3 reaction barrier of 13.9 kcal/mol, is predicted to be favored over vinyl hydroperoxide formation, dioxirane formation, and collisional stabilization. Our calculations also predict that two dioxole derivatives, 1,2-epoxy-3-butanone and 3-oxobutanal, should be major products of isoprene ozonolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Macalester College, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55105-1899, USA. kuwata@macalester.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuwata", "ForeName": "Keith T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valin", "ForeName": "Lukas C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Converse", "ForeName": "Amber D", "Initials": "AD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16863120", "10.1021/jp054346d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
