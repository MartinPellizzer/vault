Six 1-day-old Cobb chickens and twenty-four embryonated chicken eggs were examined in the Laboratory of Avian Pathology and the Laboratory of Bacteriology of the National University of Costa Rica. Twelve dead-in-shell embryos showed maceration and were immersed in a putrid, turbid, slightly thick brown liquid. Additionally, the other 12 embryonated eggs had milky yellow-orange content. The livers of those embryos had congestion, haemorrhages and multifocal cream foci of necrosis. Granulocytic infiltration was observed in the bursa of Fabricius, myocardium, liver, lung and kidney. Livers and egg yolks from six embryonated chickens and all 1-day-old chickens were aseptically collected and cultured. In addition, tissues from six better conserved embryos and all 1-day-old chickens were fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Biochemical and molecular tests identified <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> as the cause of the early, middle and late embryo mortality. As all the eggshells from the sampled embryonated eggs were dirty with soiled a fecal matter, contamination after manipulating the eggs was considered the source of infection. <i>C. testosteroni</i> is an environmental microorganism that has rarely been reported to cause human disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>C. testosteroni</i> causing mortality in a hatchery. Cleaning and disinfection using ozone were implemented in the hatchery to eliminate the embryo mortality associated with <i>C. testosteroni</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2856-7418"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Patolog\u00eda Aviar, Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional, Heredia, Costa Rica."}], "LastName": "Chaves-Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Aida J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4428-3340"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Programa de Investigaci\u00f3n en Enfermedades Tropicales, Escuela Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional, Heredia, Costa Rica."}], "LastName": "Barquero-Calvo", "ForeName": "El\u00edas", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Patolog\u00eda Aviar, Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional, Heredia, Costa Rica."}], "LastName": "Quesada-Vasquez", "ForeName": "Dioney", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Enfermedades Tropicales, Facultad Microbiolog\u00eda, Universidad Costa Rica, San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica."}], "LastName": "Chac\u00f3n-D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "Carlos", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Avian Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8210638", "ISSNLinking": "0307-9457"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chick Embryo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comamonas testosteroni"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costa Rica"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "59"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38126360", "10.1080/03079457.2023.2289587"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
