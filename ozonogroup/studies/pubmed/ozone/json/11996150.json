Both oxidation processes were able to oxidize relatively high concentrations of DEG effectively. DEG reacted primarily through hydroxyl radical produced by decomposition of ozone, and about 3 mol of ozone were consumed per mole of DEG removed during the process. For modified Fenton oxidation, stepwise addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ferric salt (Fe(III)) resulted in much higher removal of DEG than one-time pulse addition of the chemicals. The extent of DEG removal increased with increasing concentrations of both H2O2 and Fe(III). Oxidant consumption per mole of DEG oxidized was one order of magnitude higher for hydrogen peroxide than those observed for ozone. Overall, ozonation produced higher concentrations of aldehydes, and modified Fenton treatment produced higher concentrations of carboxylic acids for the same levels of DEG oxidation. The major products of ozonation were glycolaldehyde, glyoxal, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetic, formic, pyruvic, oxalic and glyoxalic acids. The major products of modified Fenton oxidation were formaldehyde, and formic and acetic acids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, San Diego State University, CA 92182-1324, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turan-Ertas", "ForeName": "Tuba", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurol", "ForeName": "Mirat D", "Initials": "MD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenton's reagent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61BR964293", "NameOfSubstance": "diethylene glycol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11996150", "10.1016/s0045-6535(01)00312-5", "S0045-6535(01)00312-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
