However, this area faces increasing environmental problems. In this study, we use ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) network in Eastern China to retrieve variations of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and formaldehyde (HCHO) in the YRD area. Three cities of YRD (Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai) were selected for long-term observations. This paper presents technical performance and characteristics of instruments, their distribution in YRD, and results of vertical column densities (VCDs) and profiles of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and HCHO. Average diurnal variations of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> in different seasons over the three stations yielded minimum values at noon or in the early afternoon, whereas tropospheric HCHO reached the maximum during midday hours. Slight reduction of the pollutants in weekends occurred in all the three sites. In general trace gas concentrations gradually reduced from Shanghai to Hefei. Tropospheric VCDs of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and HCHO were compared with those from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite observations, resulting in R<sup>2</sup> of 0.606, 0.5432, and 0.5566, respectively. According to analysis of regional transports of pollutants, pollution process happened in YRD under the north wind with the pollution dissipating in the southeast wind. The feature is significant in exploring transport of tropospheric trace gas pollution in YRD, and provides basis for satellite and model validation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
