Using O\u2083 Free-Air Concentration Enrichment, the responses of the rhizospheric bacterial communities in the O\u2083-tolerant (YD6) and the O\u2083-sensitive (IIY084) rice cultivars to O\u2083 pollution and their differences were assessed by pyrosequencing at rice tillering and anthesis stages. Elevated ground-level O\u2083 negatively influenced the bacterial community in cultivar YD6 at both rice growth stages by decreasing the bacterial phylogenetic diversities and response ratios. In contrast, in cultivar IIY084, the bacterial community responded positively at the rice tillering stage under O\u2083 pollution. However, several keystone bacterial guilds were consistently negatively affected by O\u2083 pollution in two rice cultivars. These findings indicate that continuously O\u2083 pollution would negatively influence rice agroecosystem and the crop cultivar is important in determining the soil biota responses to elevated O\u2083."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
