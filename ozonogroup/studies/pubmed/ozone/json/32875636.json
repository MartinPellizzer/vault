The organophosphates gradually decreased with time and were completely removed after 10\u00a0min, and diazinon was degraded at a relatively fast rate compared to chlorpyrifos. The products formed during the process were identified and determined with accurate mass measurements and tandem mass spectrometry spectra, providing reliable structural determination. Chlorpyrifos oxon was formed through the oxidation of chlorpyrifos, followed by the formation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and diethyl phosphate by hydrolysis. Diazinon formed various products through more complicated degradation processes than those of chlorpyrifos. The major products of diazinon degradation were 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol and diethyl phosphate by hydrolysis after oxidation, exhibiting diazoxon as an intermediate at trace levels. Direct hydrolysis of diazinon also occurred, producing diethyl thiophosphate, which was observed at a low concentration for a transient time and exhibited a less favorable process than sequential oxidation and hydrolysis. The other products, hydroxy diazinons and hydroxy-2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinols, formed by hydroxylation, were also identified, but they were present in low amounts. Degradation mechanisms of chlorpyrifos and diazinon were proposed with the quantitatively evaluated products."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Western Seoul Center, Korea Basic Science Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yunhee", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consumer Safety Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Jeollabuk-Do, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yun-Ji", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consumer Safety Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Jeollabuk-Do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Muhammad Saiful Islam", "Initials": "MSI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8045-3784"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Western Seoul Center, Korea Basic Science Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Na", "ForeName": "Yun-Cheol", "Initials": "YC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "E0192103-01", "Agency": "Research Program", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Korea Food Research Institute", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "C030370", "Agency": "Korea Basic Science Institute", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sapbamrer R, Hongsibsong S.
