However, the observed O<sub>3</sub> decrease is slower than/opposite to expectations affecting the health of millions of people. For a better understanding of this failure and its connection with anthropogenic emissions, we quantify the summer O<sub>3</sub> trends that would have occurred had the weather stayed constant by applying a numerical tool that \"de-weathers\" observations across 31 urban regions (123 cities and 392 sites) over 8 years. O<sub>3</sub> trends are significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) over 234 sites after de-weathering, contrary to the directly observed trends (only 39 significant due to high meteorology-induced variability). The de-weathered data allow categorizing cities in China into four different groups regarding O<sub>3</sub> mitigation, with group 1 exhibiting steady O<sub>3</sub> reductions, while group 4 showing significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) O<sub>3</sub> increases. Analysis of the relationships between de-weathered odd oxygen and nitrogen oxides illustrates how the changes in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, in anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and reductions in fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) affect the O<sub>3</sub> trends differently in these groups. While this analysis suggests that VOC reductions are the main driver of O<sub>3</sub> decreases in group 1, groups 3 and 4 are primarily affected by decreasing PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which results in enhanced O<sub>3</sub> formation. Our analysis demonstrates both the importance of and possibility for isolating emission-driven changes from climate and weather for interpreting short-term air quality observations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8992-7026"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2173-4014"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Qindan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6895-8464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Xiaomeng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6617-7691"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Cohen", "ForeName": "Ronald C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36083302", "10.1021/acs.est.2c03315"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
