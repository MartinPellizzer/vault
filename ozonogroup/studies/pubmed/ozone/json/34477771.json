The B-site cation is regulated by metal doping, and the resulting LaFe<sub>0.26</sub>Mn<sub>0.74</sub>O<sub>3-\u03b4</sub> with a rhombohedral structure showed excellent catalytic performance and structural stability owing to the abundant oxygen vacancies and the higher Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>4+</sup> ratios. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the oxygen vacancy has a strong affinity for ozone adsorption, and thus facilitated ozone decomposition by extending the O-O bond. Combined with low-valence Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup> cations, the electron transfer in the catalytic ozonation reaction has been enhanced, which has promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, the degradation pathway of m-cresol was proposed. Additionally, the LaFe<sub>0.26</sub>Mn<sub>0.74</sub>O<sub>3-\u03b4</sub> catalyst remained stable during a 60 h reaction. This study has not only revealed the adsorption/decomposition pathways of ozone using LaFe<sub>0.26</sub>Mn<sub>0.74</sub>O<sub>3-\u03b4</sub> perovskite nanocatalysts but also provided indepth insight into the electron transfer pathway on the surface of nanocatalysts during the process of catalytic ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, P.R.
