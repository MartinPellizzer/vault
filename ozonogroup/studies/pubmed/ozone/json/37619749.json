Cross-sectional associations were assessed by generalized linear mixed models incorporating survey-specific sampling weights.", "The joint effect of an interquartile range (IQR) increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) was positively and significantly associated with all measures of liver injury adjusting for age, sex, education, income, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, and physical activity. The ranking of effect sizes from largest to smallest percent increases were 8.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.56, 9.88) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 5.54% (95%CI 3.31, 7.77) for gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 4.81% (95%CI 3.87, 5.74) for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 2.46% (95%CI 0.26, 4.65) for total bilirubin (TBIL) and 1.18% (95%CI 0.62, 1.75) for alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Findings were not significantly different when stratified by age (\u226416, >16\u00a0yr), sex, smoking (current, other), cholesterol (\u22646.18, >6.18\u00a0mmol/l) and BMI (<30, \u226530\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>).", "These findings suggest that ambient air pollution may have a relatively small impact on the liver, but these changes may have significant impact from a population health perspective, considering the ubiquitous nature of air pollution, or for individuals exposed to very high levels of air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2023.
