The potential for harm is closely linked to the concentrations of pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), as well as their collective oxidative potential (O<sub>X</sub>). Yet, due to the challenges of directly monitoring O<sub>X</sub> as an independent factor and the influences of different substances' varying ability to contain or convey O<sub>X</sub>, uncertainties persist regarding its actual impact. To provide further evidence to the association between short-term exposures to NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>X</sub> and mortality, this study conducted multi-county time-series analyses with over-dispersed generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the mortality data from 2014 to 2020 in Jiangsu, China. The findings reveal that short-term exposures to these pollutants are linked to increased risks of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, where NO<sub>2</sub> demonstrates 2.11% (95% confidence interval: 1.79%, 2.42%), 2.28% (1.91%, 2.66%), and 2.91% (2.13%, 3.69%) respectively per every 10\u00a0ppb increase in concentration, and the effect of O<sub>3</sub> is 1.11% (0.98%, 1.24%), 1.39% (1.19%, 1.59%), and 1.82% (1.39%, 2.26%), and O<sub>X</sub> is 1.77% (1.58%, 1.97%), 2.19% (1.90%, 2.48%), and 2.90% (2.29%, 3.52%). Notably, women and individuals aged over 75 years exhibit higher susceptibility to these pollutants, with NO<sub>2</sub> showing a greater impact, especially during the warm seasons. The elevated mortality rates associated with NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>X</sub> underscore the significance of addressing air pollution as a pressing public health issue, especially in controlling NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> together. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and possible influential factors of these effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
