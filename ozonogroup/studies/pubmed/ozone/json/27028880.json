Here, we assess the effect of long-term changes in ambient [O<sub>3</sub> ] using 20\u00a0years of observations at Harvard forest. Using artificial neural networks, we found that the effect of the inclusion of [O<sub>3</sub> ] as a predictor was slight, and independent of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, which suggests limited high-frequency O<sub>3</sub> inhibition of GPP at this site. Simulations with a terrestrial biosphere model, however, suggest an average long-term O<sub>3</sub> inhibition of 10.4% for 1992-2011. A decline of [O<sub>3</sub> ] over the measurement period resulted in moderate predicted GPP trends of 0.02-0.04\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0C\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> \u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> \u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> , which is negligible relative to the total observed GPP trend of 0.41\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0C\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> \u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> \u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> . A similar conclusion is achieved with the widely used AOT40 metric. Combined, our results suggest that ozone reductions at Harvard forest are unlikely to have had a large impact on the photosynthesis trend over the past 20\u00a0years. Such limited effects are mainly related to the slow responses of photosynthesis to changes in [O<sub>3</sub> ]. Furthermore, we estimate that 40% of photosynthesis happens in the shade, where stomatal conductance and thus [O<sub>3</sub> ] deposition is lower than for sunlit leaves. This portion of GPP remains unaffected by [O<sub>3</sub> ], thus helping to buffer the changes of total photosynthesis due to varied [O<sub>3</sub> ]. Our analyses suggest that current ozone reductions, although significant, cannot substantially alleviate the damages to forest ecosystems."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University, 195 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. xu.yue@yale.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Climate Change Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100029, China. xu.yue@yale.edu."}], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7579-7494"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, 2109, Australia."}], "LastName": "Keenan", "ForeName": "Trevor F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1042-8452"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "Munger", "ForeName": "William", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University, 195 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA."}], "LastName": "Unger", "ForeName": "Nadine", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Glob Chang Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9888746", "ISSNLinking": "1354-1013"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27028880", "10.1111/gcb.13300"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
