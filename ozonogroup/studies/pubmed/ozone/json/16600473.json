This paper examines the process followed to develop this strategy. As a first step it was necessary to look at how far the implicit policy of \"business as usual\" could be stretched without jeopardizing Chile's compliance obligations. A second step included quantifying compliance costs and their impact on different policy instruments and so policy choice. Finally, the attitudes of decision-makers or participants were identified, by interviews with officials of the different public agents involved, in order to weigh their views about policy. A strategy was proposed, based on this information, which the Chilean regulator has used, although not in its entirety. The methodology developed could well be useful for developing-country Protocol signatories building their own appropriate compliance strategy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Economics and Environmental Economics and Management Program, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile. roryan@dii.uchile.cl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Ryan", "ForeName": "Ra\u00fal", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ulloa", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9s", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asencio", "ForeName": "Gonzalo", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Manage", "NlmUniqueID": "0401664", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Policy Making"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16600473", "10.1016/j.jenvman.2005.09.021", "S0301-4797(05)00321-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
