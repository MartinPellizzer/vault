From January 2018 to April 2018, data from 16,528 take out shops in Wuhan were crawled by using Python. The data included store name, average delivery time, delivery price, region, and store type. With the use of Baidu map's API batch reverse address resolution, the map locations of the take out shops were identified. Network service area was utilized to obtain the activity space of delivery men along the Wuhan traffic road network. Combined with the data on sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), PM2.5, PM10, and noise provided by the Wuhan Environmental Protection Bureau, the spatial interpolation, regional analysis, superposition analysis, and other geographic information system spatial analysis methods were used to study the air and noise pollution within the activity space of delivery men in various take out shops. Results revealed the unbalanced environment faced by Wuhan delivery men. The exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and PM2.5 was mainly concentrated in the central city, whereas the exposure to SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM10 was mainly noted far from the city. Noise pollution was mainly observed in the districts of Hannan, Caidian, and Dongxihu; and the most serious pollution was recorded in Shamao Street. The weighted comprehensive pollution index model was used to calculate the contribution weight of each evaluation factor to obtain the results of environmental exposure to air pollution. The influence of noise was further considered to obtain the consequences of comprehensive environmental exposure to pollution. The highly polluted regions were those in the central part of the city. Pollution was mainly concentrated in the third loop, whereas Zhucheng Street in the Xinzhou District provided the best environment. The results of this study can serve as a reference for the physical health risk assessment of delivery men."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5306-1163"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Nai", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Zhixing Hongtu Technology Co.Ltd, Wuhan, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hongbo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geosciences, Yangtze University, Wuhan, Hubei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiaoya", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Occup Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101282564", "ISSNLinking": "1933-8244"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motorcycles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Noise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32228223", "10.1080/19338244.2020.1743959"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
