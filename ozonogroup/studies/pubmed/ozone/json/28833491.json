The principal defenses against these reactive molecules and free radicals in plants include detoxifying enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, etc.) and also lower molecular weight secondary products with antioxidant activity. These latter compounds include a great variety of phenolic compounds, carotenoids, nitrogenous, and sulfur-containing materials. Some of the more important mechanisms of action of the secondary compounds will be discussed, with emphasis on the use of structural and kinetic data to identify the most effective antioxidants against peroxy radical-induced damage, which is perhaps the most important of the oxidative stresses present in the usual environment of plants. \u00a9 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Studies, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larson", "ForeName": "Richard A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Insect Biochem Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501752", "ISSNLinking": "0739-4462"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28833491", "10.1002/arch.940290207"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
