Whereas, the synergistic behavior and effect of microplastics and Hg(II) were rarely reported. In this context, the adsorptive behavior of Hg(II) by pristine/aged microplastics involving polystyrene, polyethylene, polylactic acid, and tire microplastics were investigated via kinetic (pseudo-first and second-order dynamics, the internal diffusion model), Langmuir, and Freundlich isothermal models; the adsorption and desorption behavior was also explored under different conditions. Microplastics aged by ozone exhibited a rougher surface attached with abundant oxygen-containing groups to enhance hydrophilicity and negative surface charge, those promoted adsorption capacity of 4-20 times increment compared with the pristine microplastics. The process (except for aged tire microplastics) was dominated by a monolayer chemical reaction, which was significantly impacted by pH, salinity, fulvic acid, and co-existing ions. Furthermore, the adsorbed Hg(II) could be effectively eluted in 0.04% HCl, simulated gastric liquids, and seawater with a maximum desorption amount of 23.26\u00a0mg/g. An artificial neural network model was used to predict the performance of microplastics in complex media and accurately capture the main influencing factors and their contributions. This finding revealed that aged microplastics had the affinity to trap Hg(II) from freshwater, whereafter it released the Hg(II) once transported into the acidic medium, the organism's gastrointestinal system, or the estuary area. These indicated that aged microplastics could be the sink or the source of Hg(II) depending on the surrounding environment, meaning that aged microplastics could be the vital carrier to Hg(II)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
