To effectively control the tropospheric ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution, this study performed measurements of 102 VOCs species from Sep.19-25 (autumn) and Nov.27-Dec. 8, 2017 (winter) at Weinan in the central Guanzhong Plain. The total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) concentrations were 95.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030.6\u00a0ppbv in autumn and 74.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037.1\u00a0ppbv in winter. Alkanes were the most abundant group in both of autumn and winter, accounting for 33.5% and 39.6% of TVOCs concentrations, respectively. The levels of aromatics and oxygenated VOCs were higher in autumn than in winter, mainly due to changes in industrial activities and combustion strength. Photochemical reactivities and ozone formation potentials (OFPs) of VOCs were calculated by applying the OH radical loss rate (L<sub>OH</sub>) and maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) method, respectively. Results showed that Alkenes and aromatics were the key VOCs in term ozone formation in Weinan, which together contributed 59.6% \u0336 65.3% to the total L<sub>OH</sub> and OFP. Secondary organic aerosol formation potentials (SOAFP) of the measured VOCs were investigated by employing the fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC) method. Aromatics contributed 94.9% and 96.2% to the total SOAFP in autumn and winter, respectively. The regional transport effects on VOCs and ozone formation were investigated by using trajectory analysis and potential source contribution function (PSCF). Results showed that regional anthropogenic sources from industrial cities (Tongchuan, Xi'an city) and biogenic sources from Qinling Mountain influenced VOCs levels and OFP at Weinan. Future studies need to emphasize on meteorological factors and sources that impact on VOCs concentrations in Weinan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
