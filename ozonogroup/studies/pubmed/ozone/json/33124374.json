The results showed that the total VOCs emission in Zhengzhou in 2016 was 96215.3 t. The highest emission source was on-road mobile source (29.7%) followed by solvent use sources (28.1%). The species that contributed the highest emission was alkanes (29.8%) followed by aromatics (29.0%). The OFP in Zhengzhou in 2016 was 341291.0 t with the highest contributing source as on-road mobile (30.5%) followed by solvent use source (28.8%). Moreover, the light duty gasoline vehicle, use of interior wall coatings, vehicle surface coating, gas station loading and unloading, and manufacture of non-metallic mineral were the major secondary emission sources of OFP, which needed to be controlled for reducing ozone pollution in Zhengzhou. For VOCs species group, the higher contribution groups were aromatics (42.8%) and alkenes (38.9%). The sources that produced <i>m/p</i>-xylene, propylene, ethylene, and other species should be paid more attention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Broadcasting System 102, Zhengzhou 450002, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Luo-Kai", "Initials": "LK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33124374", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201912192"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
