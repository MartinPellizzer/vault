The average mixing ratio of VOCs was (59.4\u00b123.6)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> and the oxygenated VOCs (OVOC) were the largest component. There was no clear \"weekend effect\" in urban Hangzhou, while the concentration of VOCs had a sharp decrease during long holidays. The concentration of VOCs had a positive correlation with air quality index (AQI) and reached the highest level when the primary pollutant was PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The assessment results of atmospheric chemical reactivity with\u00b7OH radical loss rate (<i>L</i><sup>\u00b7OH</sup>) and ozone formation potential (OFP) showed the average value of <i>L</i><sup>\u00b7OH</sup> was 7.5 s<sup>-1</sup> and that of OFP was 152.1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, among which carbonyl compounds, aromatics, and alkenes were the most abundant components. The overall chemical reactivity level of VOCs in Hangzhou was equivalent to 2-methylpentane. The average value of toluene/benzene (T/B) was 1.95, which implied the ambient VOCs in Hangzhou were influenced by vehicle exhaust. Secondary formation (17.6%), combustion (11.8%), industrial processing (12.3%), solvent use (18.1%), biogenic source (4.5%), and vehicle exhaust (35.7%) were identified as six major sources of VOCs in Hangzhou through the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Sheng-Ao", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ya-Qin", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Environmental Monitoring Central Station, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jian-Dong", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ya-Rong", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Li", "Initials": "HL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33374046", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202004021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
