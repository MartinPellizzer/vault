The climate sensitivity of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions is poorly known, which makes it difficult to project how changing fertilizer use and climate will impact radiative forcing and the ozone layer. Analysis of 6 y of hourly N<sub>2</sub>O mixing ratios from a very tall tower within the US Corn Belt-one of the most intensive agricultural regions of the world-combined with inverse modeling, shows large interannual variability in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (316 Gg N<sub>2</sub>O-N\u22c5y<sup>-1</sup> to 585 Gg N<sub>2</sub>O-N\u22c5y<sup>-1</sup>). This implies that the regional emission factor is highly sensitive to climate. In the warmest year and spring (2012) of the observational period, the emission factor was 7.5%, nearly double that of previous reports. Indirect emissions associated with runoff and leaching dominated the interannual variability of total emissions. Under current trends in climate and anthropogenic N use, we project a strong positive feedback to warmer and wetter conditions and unabated growth of regional N<sub>2</sub>O emissions that will exceed 600 Gg N<sub>2</sub>O-N\u22c5y<sup>-1</sup>, on average, by 2050. This increasing emission trend in the US Corn Belt may represent a harbinger of intensifying N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from other agricultural regions. Such feedbacks will pose a major challenge to the Paris Agreement, which requires large N<sub>2</sub>O emission mitigation efforts to achieve its goals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published under the PNAS license."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil, Water, and Climate, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN 55108; timgriffis@umn.edu."}], "LastName": "Griffis", "ForeName": "Timothy J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil, Water, and Climate, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN 55108."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zichong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil, Water, and Climate, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN 55108."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Research Service, US Department of Agriculture, St. Paul, MN 55108."}], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil, Water, and Climate, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN 55108."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211."}], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "Jeffrey D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil, Water, and Climate, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN 55108."}], "LastName": "Millet", "ForeName": "Dylan B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yale-NUIST Center on Atmospheric Environment, Nanjing University of Information, Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Xuhui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil, Water, and Climate, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN 55108."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Research Service, US Department of Agriculture, St. Paul, MN 55108."}], "LastName": "Venterea", "ForeName": "Rodney T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil, Water, and Climate, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN 55108."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305."}], "LastName": "Turner", "ForeName": "Peter A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations  2015 World Fertilizer Trends and Outlook to 2018.
