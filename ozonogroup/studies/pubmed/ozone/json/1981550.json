Hepatic microsomes, supplemented with NADPH, catalyzed the release of F- from R-134a; metabolite production was positively correlated with both duration of incubation and gas phase [R-134a]. Defluorination of R-134a was inhibited by CO, lack of NADPH, or heat denaturation of microsomes. Release of F- from R- 134a biotransformation as shown by the near-total lack of dehalogenation during anaerobic incubations. R-134a did not produce a difference spectrum (360 to 500 nm) with either oxidized or dithionite-reduced microsomes. Microsomes from phenobarbital- or Aroclor 1254-treated rats produced greater amounts of F- per mg protein from high concentrations of R-134a than did microsomes from untreated rats, but when normalized for microsomal cytochrome P-450 content both phenobarbital and Aroclor treatment decreased the specific activity (nmol F-/nmol cytochrome P-450) of R-134a metabolism. Furthermore, while defluorination of R-134a by microsomes from livers of untreated rats was substrate-saturable (Vmax, 11 nmol of F-/nmol cytochrome P-450/15 min; KM, 8% R-134a), R-134a dehalogenation by microsomes from Aroclor-treated rats was nonsaturable with [R-134a] as high as 69%. Microsomes from phenobarbital-treated rats retained the saturable, low KM activity, but also exhibited the apparently nonsaturable kinetic component when [R-134a] was greater than 24%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI 48090."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olson", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reidy", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pederson", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Dispos", "NlmUniqueID": "9421550", "ISSNLinking": "0090-9556"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aroclors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Formates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11097-69-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DH9E53K1Y8", "NameOfSubstance": "norflurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q80VPU408O", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UQT9G45D1P", "NameOfSubstance": "Halothane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YQE403BP4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenobarbital"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aroclors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Azides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine)"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Formates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Halothane"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenobarbital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potentiometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1981550"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
