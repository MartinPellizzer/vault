The episodes were for 8 h daily and for 1-4 d in succession, with seasonal totals of 24-27 d. A nondestructive method for estimating whole-tree leaf area was developed in 1992 and used to monitor leaf area, leaf number and leaf size in 1993 and 1994. Stomatal density and leaf abscission were also studied. No effects of exposure to ozone on leaf area and leaf number were detected. In 1994 there were consistent trends towards greater mean leaf size and higher stomatal density in trees exposed to ozone, but these effects were not significant at the 95% confidence level. Leaf abscission was slower in trees exposed to ozone in 1992 and 1994, but not in 1993 when there were fewer exposure days late in the season."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ADAS Terrington, Terrington St. Clement, King's Lynn, Norfolk PE34 4PW, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wiltshire", "ForeName": "J J J", "Initials": "JJJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington, Loughborough, Leicestershire LEI 2 5RD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington, Loughborough, Leicestershire LEI 2 5RD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colls", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington, Loughborough, Leicestershire LEI 2 5RD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Craigon", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Analysis of Environmental Change, Oregon State University, Weniger Hall 283, Corvallis, OR97331-6511, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Unsworth", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Arco JM del, Escudero A, Garrido MV. 1991 Effects of site characteristics on nitrogen retranslocation from senescing leaves.
