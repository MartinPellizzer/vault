Data on allergic diseases and environmental exposure were collected. Skin prick tests were performed. Individual exposure to air pollution was estimated using a geographic information system with the mean concentration of air pollutants. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the association between air pollutants, allergen exposure and the risk of allergic diseases with adjustments for potential confounders.", "Overall, 12.6% of the children had asthma, 30.0% had allergic rhinitis (AR), and 14.4% had atopic dermatitis (AD). Mite sensitization significantly increased the risk of AD, AR, and asthma (OR (95%CI) 2.15 (1.53-3.03), 1.94 (1.46-2.58), and 2.31 (1.63-3.29), respectively). Exposure to PM10, PM(2.5), CO, and O(3) was associated with asthma (OR (95% CI) 1.39 (1.03-1.87), 1.45 (1.07-1.97), 1.36 (1.01-1.83), and 0.68 (0.51-0.92), respectively). PM(2.5) may have increased the risk of AR (OR (95% CI) 1.54 (1.03-2.32). Mite sensitization showed a synergistic effect with PM(2.5) on the development of asthma (p < 0.001). Moreover, mite allergens may modify the effect of air pollutants on allergic diseases.", "Dust mites and PM(2.5) play an important role on the risk of asthma and AR.
