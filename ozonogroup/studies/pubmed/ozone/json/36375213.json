The aim of this study was to test the in\u00a0vitro bacteriocidal action of an Ozone/Oxygen gas mixture on bacteria isolated from the cervico-vaginal mucus of cows affected by acute metritis. A pilot study was initially carried out on reference strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Mycoplasma bovigenitalium ATCC 19852) that were tested with three different treatments: a control positive baseline group (B-group) was incubated without gas treatment, a control positive oxygen group (O<sub>2</sub>-group) was treated with pure oxygen 100%, and the treated group (T-group) was exposed to a gaseous constant flow of an Ozone/Oxygen mixture, at 50, 35, 20\u00a0\u03bcg Ozone/ml and for 5, 3 and 1\u00a0min for every different Ozone concentration. In both positive control groups, the number of colony forming units (CFU) per ml was higher than 300\u00a0CFU/ml (E.\u00a0coli and S.\u00a0aureus) and higher than 30\u00a0CFU/ml for M.\u00a0bovigenitalium, after incubation. The T-groups showed a minimal bacterial growth equal to or lower than 1\u00a0CFU/ml per plate. Based on the results of the pilot study, a second phase was performed on bacteria isolated from the cervico-vaginal mucus (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and M.\u00a0bovigenitalium) using the lower concentration of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of Ozone for the minimum exposure time of 1\u00a0min. The E.\u00a0coli and S. aureus reference strains and the clinical isolates (K.\u00a0pneumoniae, E. agglomerans, E. coli, P. mirabilis) were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h and the colonies were manually counted at 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h following inoculation. The cultures of M.\u00a0bovigenitalium (both ATCC and clinical isolate) were incubated in a jar with modified atmosphere conditions with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 4-7 days and colony counting was performed. The second phase showed a low number of CFUs (equal to or less than 7\u00a0CFU/ml) for the clinical isolates K.\u00a0pneumoniae, E. agglomerans, E. coli and P.\u00a0mirabilis, and, of note, for M.\u00a0bovigenitalium, both ATCC and clinical isolate, the growth was completely inhibited. Ozone was demonstrated to have a bacteriocidal activity. This study encourages further research of in\u00a0vivo application of low doses of gaseous Ozone for the treatment of metritis in cows by using minimal exposure times."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
