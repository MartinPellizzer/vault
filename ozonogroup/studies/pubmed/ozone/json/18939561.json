Emissions and their spatial allocation were determined based on the development pattern and used to predict hourly ozone concentrations. Differences in hourly ozone concentrations due to changes in anthropogenic emissions between the future case scenarios and a 2007 base case ranged from -14 to 22 ppb and were primarily associated with the implementation of federal mobile source standards; differences due to biogenic emissions and dry deposition due to urbanization ranged from only -1.4 to 0.7 ppb. These differences in the magnitude of emissions produced greater changes in air quality than differences in regional development patterns between the four scenarios. Differences in hourly ozone concentrations between the future development scenarios and a 2007 base case ranged from -14 to 22 ppb, in contrast to differences of -3 to 5 ppb between the future scenarios. The results imply that although the effects of urbanization patterns are non-negligible, the pattern of urban development is not as significant as reductions in emissions per capita."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Energy and Environmental Resources, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jihee", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Webb", "ForeName": "Alba", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parmenter", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "David T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonald-Buller", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urbanization"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18939561", "10.1021/es800645j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
