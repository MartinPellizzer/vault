The model tends to overpredict non-oxygenated VOCs and underpredict OVOCs, which has been improved with adjusted emissions of all VOCs. The OVOCs in the YRD are dominated by ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols. Ketones and aldehydes mainly originate from direct emissions and secondary formation in the northern YRD, and primarily originate from secondary formation in the southern part influenced by biogenic emissions. The concentration of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) produced by OVOCs is 0.5-1.5 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, with 40-80% originated from organic nitrates, 20-70% originated from dicarbonyls, and 0-20% originated from isoprene epoxydiols. The influences of OVOCs on the atmospheric oxidation capacity are dominated by the OH<sup>\u2022</sup> pathway during the day (\u223c350%) and by the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2022</sup> pathway at night (\u223c150%). Consequently, O<sub>3</sub> is enhanced by 30-70% in the YRD. Aerosols are also enhanced by 50-140%, 20-80%, and \u223c20% for SOA, nitrate, and sulfate, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9763-500X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jingyi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Xiaodong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xueying", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0655-3389"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hongli", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Sheng'ao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4560-433X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-3136, United States."}], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Momei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5694-4794"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jianlin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ketones"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35925776", "10.1021/acs.est.2c00038"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
