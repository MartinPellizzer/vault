The results of the first pilot study showed that catalytic ozonation achieved the same degree of disinfection as conventional ozonation with 30% lower applied ozone dose and enhanced the removal of several contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). The second pilot study conducted over 6 months of operation with the same batch of catalyst showed sustained enhanced removal of CECs relative to ozonation alone. The removals of CECs by catalytic ozonation was particularly effective for compounds with low reaction rates with ozone, indicating reactions with hydroxyl radicals formed in the presence of the catalyst. Analysis of plasma vitellogenin and total glutathione in liver tissues of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) injected with wastewater extracts indicated that catalytic ozonation removed the estrogenic activity and modulated oxidative stress caused by exposure to the organic compounds in wastewater extracts. Analysis of other biomarker responses indicated that no transformation products were formed that can cause lipid damage in the liver or affect levels of a brain neurotransmitter (i.e. serotonin). Catalytic ozonation is a promising technology to increase the efficiency of ozone treatment of municipal wastewater and to meet increasingly more stringent regulations for effluent quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
