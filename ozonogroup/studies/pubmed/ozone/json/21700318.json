Disinfection of waters containing estrogens through oxidative processes has been shown to lead to the formation of disinfection byproducts, which may also be estrogenic. The present work investigates the formation of disinfection byproducts of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) in the treatment of water with ozone. Experiments have been carried out at two different concentrations of the estrogens in ground water (100 ng L(-1) and 100 \u03bcg L(-1)) and at varying ozone dosages (0-30 mg L(-1)). Detection of the estrogens and their disinfection byproducts in the water samples has been performed by means of ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) and a quadrupole-time of flight (QqTOF) instrument. Both E2 and E1 have been found to form two main byproducts, with molecular mass (MM) 288 and 278 in the case of E2, and 286 and 276 in the case of E1, following presumably the same reaction pathways. The E2 byproduct with MM 288 has been identified as 10 epsilon-17beta-dihydroxy-1,4-estradieno-3-one (DEO), in agreement with previously published results. The molecular structures and the formation pathways of the other three newly identified byproducts have been suggested. These byproducts have been found to be formed at both high and low concentrations of the estrogens and to be persistent even after application of high ozone dosages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
