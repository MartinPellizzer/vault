The samples were obtained from three water treatment plants by using conventional or better treatments (ozonation, biological filtration). All samples of river water contained the microorganisms sought, and only C. perfringens counts were correlated with human enteric viruses, cysts, or oocysts. For settled and filtered water samples, all indicators were statistically correlated with human enteric viruses but not with cysts or oocysts. By using multiple regression, the somatic coliphage counts were the only explanatory variable for the human enteric virus counts in settled water, while in filtered water samples it was C. perfringens counts. Finished water samples of 1,000 liters each were free of all microorganisms, except for a single sample that contained low levels of cysts and oocysts of undetermined viability. Three of nine finished water samples of 20,000 liters each revealed residual levels of somatic coliphages at 0.03, 0.10, and 0.26 per 100 liters. Measured virus removal was more than 4 to 5 log10, and cyst removal was more than 4 log10. Coliphage and C. perfringens counts suggested that the total removal and inactivation was more than 7 log10 viable microorganisms. C. perfringens counts appear to be the most suitable indicator for the inactivation and removal of viruses in drinking water treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut Armand-Frappier, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Laval, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Payment", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Franco", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium perfringens"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coliphages"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1985 Nov;31(11):977-80", "ArticleIdList": ["3004683"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1985 Nov;50(5):1308-10", "ArticleIdList": ["3004330"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1988 Jan;34(1):78-9", "ArticleIdList": ["2897874"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1991 Feb;37(2):154-7", "ArticleIdList": ["1647854"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1983 May;45(5):1646-50", "ArticleIdList": ["6870242"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1987 Jun;33(6):568-70", "ArticleIdList": ["3040204"]}, {"Citation": "Microbiol Sci. 1987 Dec;4(12):362-4", "ArticleIdList": ["3153603"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1988 May;34(5):651-5", "ArticleIdList": ["2850100"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1984 Mar;47(3):591-2", "ArticleIdList": ["6324679"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1991 Sep;57(9):2617-21", "ArticleIdList": ["1768135"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1988 Mar;34(3):271-2", "ArticleIdList": ["2843272"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1989 Oct;35(10):932-5", "ArticleIdList": ["2555036"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1979 Jan;37(1):55-66", "ArticleIdList": ["216310"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993 Jan;59(1):47-51", "ArticleIdList": ["16348859"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8368831", "PMC182300", "10.1128/aem.59.8.2418-2424.1993"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
