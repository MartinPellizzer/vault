With the increasingly prominent problems of environmental pollution, social pressure, ozone layer thinning and food safety, skin problems have become more and more complex. The skin can reflect the overall health of the body. Skincare products for external use alone cannot fundamentally solve skin problems; it needs to improve the overall health of the body. Based on the literature review in recent 20 years, this paper systematically reviewed the potential delaying effect of tea and its active ingredients on skin aging by oral and external use. Tea is the second-largest health drink after water. It is rich in tea polyphenols, l-theanine, tea pigments, caffeine, tea saponins, tea polysaccharides and other secondary metabolites. Tea and its active substances have whitening, nourishing, anti-wrinkle, removing spots and other skincare effects. Its mechanism of action is ultraviolet absorption, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, inhibition of extracellular matrix aging, inhibiting the accumulation of melanin and toxic oxidation products, balancing intestinal and skin microorganisms, and improving mood and sleep, among other effects. At present, tea elements skincare products are deeply loved by consumers. This paper provides a scientific theoretical basis for tea-assisted beauty and the high-end application of tea in skincare products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Center of Engineering Technology for Utilization of Botanical Functional Ingredients, Changsha 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Meiyan", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Wenjing", "Initials": "W", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Xinya", "Initials": "X", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Baozhu", "Initials": "B", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yingzi", "Initials": "Y", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Haitao", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Shuxian", "Initials": "S", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33666618", "10.1039/d0fo02921a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
