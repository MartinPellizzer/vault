This paper describes the analysis of bromate via ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The separation of bromate from interferences such as bromide and brominated haloacetic acids is achieved using a PA-100 column in combination with a 5 mM HNO3 + 25 mM NH4NO3 mobile phase. Polyatomic ions are observed on masses 79 and 81 in a synthetic phosphate matrix and in ozonated drinking waters. These polyatomic ions have been tentatively identified as PO3+ and H2PO3+. These polyatomic ions do not interfere with the detection of bromate because phosphate elutes prior to bromate. A polyatomic ion is observed on mass 81 in a synthetic sulfate matrix and in ozonated drinking waters. This polyatomic ion has been tentatively identified as HSO3+ and does not interfere with the detection of bromate because sulfate elutes after bromate. Isotope dilution analysis produces a relative standard deviation (RSD) of approximately 5% for both enriched isotopic additions at sample concentrations of 10 ng/g. The RSD associated with the direct analysis of bromate is 3.2% at sample concentrations of 10 ng/g. The bromate concentrations determined in ozonated drinking waters via isotope dilution analysis are within 10% of the concentrations determined via direct analysis for sample concentrations above 2 ng/g. The detection limit for the direct analysis of bromate via IC-ICPMS is 0.3 ng/g."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Exposure Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Creed", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brockhoff", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicator Dilution Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9989389", "10.1021/ac980663n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
