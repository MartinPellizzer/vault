Three treatments were employed: (1) Control treatment (CK), AOT40=0; (2) O3-1, AOT40=1.59 ppm\u2022h; (3) O3-2, AOT40=9.17 ppm\u2022h. Soil samples were collected for the assessment of microbial biomass C, community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs), and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). EO3 concentration significantly reduced soil microbial carbon and changed microbial CLPPs in rhizosphere soil, but not in non-rhizosphere soil. The results of the PLFAs showed that eO3 concentrations had significant effects on soil community structure in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils. The relative abundances of fungal and actinomycetous indicator PLFAs decreased in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, while those of bacterial PLFAs increased. Thus the results proved that eO3 concentration significantly changed the soil microbial community function and composition, which would influence the soil nutrient supply and carbon dynamics under O3 exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015.
