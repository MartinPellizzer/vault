Although studies have shown that oxidation using potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>), chlorine and ozone helps to remove cyanobacteria cells, the potential effects of these oxidants on cell viability and the release of off-flavor substances have scarcely been explored. This study investigated the impacts of three widely used oxidants on Pseudanabaena sp. (a common species of 2-MIB producing cyanobacteria) inactivation, and on the release and degradation of intracellular 2-MIB. Experiments using KMnO<sub>4</sub> showed that both the cell viability and 2-MIB release fit to a two-stage second-order kinetic model with a threshold of KMnO<sub>4</sub> exposure (ct). No significant variations in the cell viability and 2-MIB release occurred until the exposure reached ct because KMnO<sub>4</sub> was primarily consumed by the dissolved and cell-bound organic matters before it damaged the cell. However, chlorine permeates the cell membrane more easily, causing rapid algae inactivation and the subsequent cell lysis and 2-MIB release. Unlike permanganate and chlorine, which are unable to degrade the released 2-MIB because of their insufficient oxidation potentials, ozone is capable to inactivate the cell and degrade 2-MIB as well. When the initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration is above a certain level (1.0\u202fmg \u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> in this study), the released 2-MIB can be substantially oxidized. Therefore, the choice of a suitable oxidant and a proper dose is highly important in the control of off-flavor compounds during the treatment of algae-containing raw water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
