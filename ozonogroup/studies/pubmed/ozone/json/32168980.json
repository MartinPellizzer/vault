This prospective, observational, noncomparative, post-authorization safety study (OZONE) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of aflibercept plus fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in patients with mCRC treated in daily practice after failure of an oxaliplatin-based regimen. Patients were grouped by age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, race, number, and type of prior anticancer therapy. Of 766 treated patients enrolled, 59.5% were male, 94.8% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, all received previous chemotherapy (97.8% including oxaliplatin), and 58.6% had prior exposure to bevacizumab. At least one grade \u2265 3 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was reported in 68.3% of patients. Neutropenia, hypertension, diarrhea, and asthenia were the most frequently occurring grade \u2265 3 TEAEs. Antivascular endothelial growth factor class events were infrequent. Subgroup analyses did not reveal major differences in the safety profile according to age, renal and hepatic status, race, or prior anticancer therapy. For the total population, median overall survival was 12.5 months, median progression-free survival was 6.1 months, and overall response rate was 16.3%. Aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI is a safe and efficacious regimen administered in current clinical practice to patients with mCRC previously treated with oxaliplatin. The study results, conducted in real-world clinical practice with a less selected patient population, are aligned with the VELOUR (NCT00561470) trial and no new safety issues were identified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0286-8703"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London and Surrey, Sutton SM2 5PT, UK."}], "LastName": "Chau", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA."}], "LastName": "Fakih", "ForeName": "Marwan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, 28003 Madrid, Spain."}], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Alfonso", "ForeName": "Pilar", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Hospital Motol, 150 06 Prague 5, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Linke", "ForeName": "Zden\u0115k", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7672-2638"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, 28222 Majadahonda, Spain."}], "LastName": "Ruiz Casado", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Miguel Servet University Hospital, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain."}], "LastName": "Marques", "ForeName": "Eduardo Polo", "Initials": "EP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ividata, 92300 Levallois Perret, France."}], "LastName": "Picard", "ForeName": "Pascaline", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sanofi, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}], "LastName": "Celanovic", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ocala Oncology, Ocala, FL 34474, USA."}], "LastName": "Cartwright", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "AccessionNumberList": ["NCT00561470"]}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "n/a", "Agency": "Sanofi", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "ENCEPP/SDPP/4836", "Agency": "Sanofi", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Cancers (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101526829", "ISSNLinking": "2072-6694"}, "CoiStatement": "IC has participated in advisory boards for Eli-Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, MSD, Bayer, Roche, Merck Serono, Five Prime Therapeutics, Astra Zeneca, Oncologie International, and Pierre Fabre, has received research funding from Eli-Lilly, Janssen-Cilag, Sanofi Oncology, and Merck Serono, and has received honorarium from Eli-Lilly.
