The cell-associated viral samples were adjusted to a turbidity of 5 nephelometric turbidity units. The cell-associated poliovirus and coxsackievirus samples demonstrated survival in a continuous-flow ozonation system at applied ozone dosages of 4.06 and 4.68 mg/liter, respectively, for 30 s. Unassociated viral controls were inactivated by the application of 0.081 mg of ozone per liter for 10 s. Ultrasonic treatment of cell-associated enteric viruses did not increase inactivation of the cell-associated viruses. The batch reactor with a declining ozone residual did not effect total inactivation of either cell-associated enteric virus. These cell-associated viruses were completely inactivated after exposure to ozone in a batch reactor using continuous ozonation. Inactivation of cell-associated poliovirus required a 2-min contact period with an applied ozone dosage of 6.82 mg/liter and a residual ozone concentration of 4.70 mg/liter, whereas the coxsackievirus was completely inactivated after a 5-min exposure to an applied ozone dosage of 4.81 mg/liter with an ozone residual of 2.18 mg/liter. These data indicate that viruses associated with cells or cell fragments are protected from inactivation by ozone concentrations that readily inactivate purified virus. The cell-associated viral samples used in this research contained particles that were 10 to 15 microns in size. Use of a filtration system before ozonation would remove these particles, thereby facilitating inactivation of any remaining viruses associated with cellular fragments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emerson", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sproul", "ForeName": "O J", "Initials": "OJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buck", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Poliovirus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Appl Microbiol. 1972 Jul;24(1):13-7", "ArticleIdList": ["4341520"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Microbiol. 1975 Aug;30(2):212-22", "ArticleIdList": ["240308"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1976 Feb;31(2):173-81", "ArticleIdList": ["11743"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1980 Jan;39(1):210-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16345489"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6280611", "PMC241881", "10.1128/aem.43.3.603-608.1982"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
