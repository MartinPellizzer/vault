CHOCHO is the smallest compound of di-carbonyl group. As a primary sink of CHOCHO, its photolysis with NOx (oxides of nitrogen) results in the production of tropospheric ozone. Therefore, the focus of CHOCHO DOAS measurements is increasing in trend. We did the measurements from 09 May 2017 to 09 September 2017. The study was conducted to compare different retrieval settings in order to reveal best DOAS fit settings for CHOCHO; furthermore, effect of haze and non-haze days on CHOCHO concentration was examined. The root mean square of residual and Differential Slant Column density (dSCD) error was reduced when measurements were done with lower wavelength limit around 432-438\u202fnm and upper intervals around 455-460\u202fnm. Thus, lower wavelength intervals around 432-438\u202fnm and upper intervals around 457-460\u202fnm were best for the retrieval of dSCDs for CHOCHO. Meteorological conditions like haze or non-haze days did not have significant effect on DOAS fit parameters. The CHOCHO vertical column densities range from 1.33E+14 to 9.77E+14\u202fmolecules/cm<sup>2</sup> during the study period with average of 6.16E+14\u202fmolecules/cm<sup>2</sup>. The results indicated that during haze days CHOCHO concentration was higher because of lower rate of photolysis and atmospheric oxidation potential. Our results did not show any significant weekend effect on CHOCHO atmospheric concentration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
