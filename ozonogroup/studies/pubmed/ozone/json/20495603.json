Time-series of daily mortality counts, air pollution, and air temperature were obtained for the city of Moscow during a 3-year period (2003-2005). To estimate the pollution-mortality relationships, we used a log-linear model that controlled for potential confounding by daily air temperature and longer term trends. The effects of 10 mug/m(3) increases in daily average measures of particulate matter </=10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)) and O(3) were, respectively, (1) a 0.33% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.57] and 1.09% (95% CI 0.71-1.47) increase in all-cause non-accidental mortality in Moscow; (2) a 0.66% (0.30-1.02) and 1.61% (1.01-2.21) increase in mortality from ischemic heart disease; (3) a 0.48% (0.02-0.94) and 1.28% (0.54-2.02) increase in mortality from cerebrovascular diseases. In the age group >75 years, mortality increments were consistently higher, typically by factor of 1.2 - 1.5, depending upon the cause of death. PM(10)-mortality relationships were significantly modified by O(3) levels. On the days with O(3) concentrations above the 90th percentile, PM(10) risk for all-cause mortality was threefold greater and PM(10) risk for cerebrovascular disease mortality was fourfold greater than the unadjusted risk estimate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Laboratory, Institute of Forecasting, Russian Academy of Sciences, Nakhimovsky Prospect 47, Moscow, 117418 Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Revich", "ForeName": "Boris", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shaposhnikov", "ForeName": "Dmitri", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Air Qual Atmos Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101317801", "ISSNLinking": "1873-9318"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bates D.
