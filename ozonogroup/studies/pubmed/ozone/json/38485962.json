While many studies have developed empirical models to elucidate the effects of meteorology on ozone variability, they predominantly focus on local weather conditions, overlooking the influences from high-altitude and broader regional meteorological patterns. Here, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a technique typically applied to image recognition, to investigate the influence of three-dimensional spatial variations in meteorological fields on the daily, seasonal, and interannual dynamics of ozone in Shenzhen, a major coastal urban center in China. Our optimized CNNs model, covering a 13\u00b0 \u00d7 13\u00b0 spatial domain, effectively explains over 70% of daily ozone variability, outperforming alternative empirical approaches by 7 to 62%. Model interpretations reveal the crucial roles of 2-m temperature and humidity as primary drivers, contributing 16% and 15% to daily ozone fluctuations, respectively. Regional wind fields account for up to 40% of ozone changes during the episodes. CNNs successfully replicate observed ozone temporal patterns, attributing -5-6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> of interannual ozone variability to weather anomalies. Our interpretable CNNs framework enables quantitative attribution of historical ozone fluctuations to nonlinear meteorological effects across spatiotemporal scales, offering vital process-based insights for managing megacity air quality amidst changing climate regimes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of
