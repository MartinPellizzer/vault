However, accurate quantification of AOC still remains uncertainty. In this study, a comprehensive field campaign was conducted during autumn 2019 in downtown of Beijing, where O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> episodes had been experienced successively. The observation-based model (OBM) is used to quantify the AOC at O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> episodes. The strong intensity of AOC is found at O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> episodes, and hydroxyl radical (OH) is the dominating daytime oxidant for both episodes. The photolysis of O<sub>3</sub> is main source of OH at O<sub>3</sub> episode; the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) plays important role in OH formation at PM<sub>2.5</sub> episode. The radicals loss routines vary according to precursor pollutants, resulting in different types of air pollution. O<sub>3</sub> budgets and sensitivity analysis indicates that O<sub>3</sub> production is transition regime (both VOC and NO<sub>x</sub>-limited) at O<sub>3</sub> episode. The heterogeneous reaction of hydroperoxy radicals (HO<sub>2</sub>) on aerosol surfaces has significant influence on OH and O<sub>3</sub> production rates. The HO<sub>2</sub> uptake coefficient (\u03b3HO<sub>2</sub>) is the determining factor and required accurate measurement in real atmospheric environment. Our findings could provide the important bases for coordinated control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
