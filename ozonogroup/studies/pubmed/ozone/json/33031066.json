However, the salicylhydroxamic acid flotation wastewater discharge may cause damage to the water environment for the residual processing reagents with poor biodegradability. Combined O<sub>3</sub> and biological aerated filter (BAF) has a well-known potential for removing refractory or toxic organic pollutants. Combined process of O<sub>3</sub> and BAF (O<sub>3</sub>-BAF) was applied to treat the simulated wastewater from W-Mo mineral processing in this study. Compared single ozonation to O<sub>3</sub>-BAF, various influencing factors were discussed like O<sub>3</sub> dosage, reaction time, initial pH value, gas-water ratio and organic loading. Meanwhile, degradation mechanism of salicylhydroxamic acid was reduced. Under the optimal experiment conditions as pH value 8, O<sub>3</sub> dosage 1.3 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, reaction time 15 min, the five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>)/chemical oxygen demand of potassium dichromate (CODCr) value increased to from 0.19 to 0.35. The effluent was pumped to the following BAF process, when the optimal experiment conditions was organic load = 0.82 kgCODCr (m<sup>-3</sup>\u00b7d<sup>-1</sup>), gas-water ratio = 6:1, CODCr concentration of effluent was 28.92 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> and the removal ratio was 86.26%, while the removal ratio could higher to 91.12% for the O<sub>3</sub>-BAF combined process. The effluent could meet the discharge and reuse emission standards requirements in China. UV-vis absorption spectra and high performance liquid chromatography showed the degradation pathway of salicylhydroxamic acid by ozone oxidation was salicylhydroxamic acid \u2192 salicylic acid + hydroxylamine \u2192 catechol \u2192 maleic \u2192 small molecular organic acid \u2192 carbon dioxide + water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China E-mail: haozimei77@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Liping", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China E-mail: haozimei77@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shengnian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China E-mail: haozimei77@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China E-mail: haozimei77@163.com."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Xiaofei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing, China E-mail: haozimei77@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8Q07182D0T", "NameOfSubstance": "salicylhydroxamic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salicylamides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33031066", "10.2166/wst.2020.388"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
