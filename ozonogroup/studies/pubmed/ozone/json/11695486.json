The presence of hydroxyl radicals and their effect on the overall rate of reaction was studied. Second order kinetic constants of direct reactions were estimated at around 252 M(-1) s(-1), 41 M(-1) s(-1) and 22 M(-1) s(-1), for 1NS, 1,5NDS, and 3NBS sulphonic acids, respectively. At pH 3, the indirect reaction accounted for 2%, 15% and 4% of total primary oxidation of 1 NS, 1,5NBS, and 3NBS sulphonic acids, respectively. At pH 9, indirect reaction contribution increased to 73%, 84% and 48%, respectively. C4 compounds (maleic and fumaric acids), C2 (oxalic), C1 (formic) and sulphate were identified as oxidation by-products in all cases. TOC slowly decreased throughout ozonation, reaching around 40-60% and 60-70% reduction over 90 minutes at pH 7 and 3, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering Department, University of Concepci\u00f3n, Chile."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calderara", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jekel", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zaror", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "98-47-5", "NameOfSubstance": "3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11695486"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
