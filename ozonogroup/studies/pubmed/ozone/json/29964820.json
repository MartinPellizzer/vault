The ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs was estimated by the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR). The result showed that the total anthropogenic emission amount of VOCs in Jiangsu Province was 1927.8 kt in 2015. Fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, solvent utilization, biomass burning, vehicles, and storage and transport contributed 7.38%, 27.93%, 39.56%, 3.55%, 16.18%, and 5.39%, respectively. Suzhou, Nanjing, and Xuzhou were the three cities with the highest amount, contributing more than 200 kt of VOCs. The total amount of OFP from 56 ozone-precursor VOCs was 5429.5 kt. The contribution to OFP from the equipment manufacturing, vehicles manufacturing and building decoration was 30%-60% more than their contribution to the emissions. The coating VOC reduction would be more efficient for alleviating O<sub>3</sub> pollution. The 10 VOC species with the largest OFP contribution were <i>m/p</i>-xylene, ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, toluene, <i>o</i>-xylene, 1-butene, ethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and <i>p</i>-ethyltoluene, which contributed 75.63% of the total OFP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Jiangsu Province Academy of Environmental Science, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Si-Jia", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Jiangsu Province Academy of Environmental Science, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Jiangsu Province Academy of Environmental Science, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qiu-Yue", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964820", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201705218"]}}]}
