However, little information is available on the removal of antibiotics during sludge ozonation. Therefore, this study investigated first the behavior of four commonly-used hydrophobic antibiotics, including three tetracyclines (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and doxycycline) and one macrolide (azithromycin) in activated sludge process and then their removal during sludge reduction by ozone. Results indicate that the studied antibiotics were primarily transferred into the solid phase of activated sludge via sorption, which was a reversible, spontaneous, and exothermic process governed by surface reactions. Sludge ozonation could effectively remove 86.4-93.6% of the antibiotics present in the sludge at an ozone dose of 102\u202fmg per gram of mixed liquor suspended solids and pH 7.2. The removal of studied antibiotics mainly proceeded through desorption and subsequent oxidation. Increasing the initial pH from 5.0 to 9.5 obviously enhanced the antibiotic removal during sludge ozonation. This study demonstrated that the activated sludge process coupled with sludge ozonation can simultaneously reduce excess sludge and eliminate antibiotics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
