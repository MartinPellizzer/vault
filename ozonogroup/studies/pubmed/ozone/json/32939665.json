Although patient experience of primary care is associated with vaccine uptake in children, this relationship remains unclear for older adults.", "This study examined the association between patient experience of primary care and influenza/pneumococcal vaccine uptake in older adults.", "We conducted a multicentered cross-sectional survey involving 25 primary care institutions in urban and rural areas in Japan. Participants were outpatients aged \u2265\u200965\u00a0years who visited one of the participating institutions within the 1-week study period. We assessed patient experience of primary care using the Japanese version of the Primary Care Assessment Tool (JPCAT), which includes six domains: first contact (accessibility), longitudinality (continuity of care), coordination, comprehensiveness (services available), comprehensiveness (services provided), and community orientation. We used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to adjust for clustering within institutions and individual covariates.", "One thousand participants were included in the analysis. After adjusting for clustering within institutions and other possible confounders, influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake was positively associated with JPCAT total scores (odds ratio per 1 standard deviation increase: 1.19, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.40 and odds ratio: 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.46, respectively). Of the JPCAT domains, coordination and community orientation were associated with influenza vaccine uptake and longitudinality, coordination, and comprehensiveness were associated with pneumococcal vaccine uptake.", "Influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake were positively associated with patient experience of primary care in older adults.
