Ozone treatment can improve AD conditions by its bactericidal effect on S. aureus.", "To study the effects of topical ozone therapy on microbiome diversity in AD lesions and explore potential probiotic pathogens correlated with AD progression.", "Patients with moderate to severe bilateral skin lesions in AD were recruited. Randomized split sides were performed. One side was treated with ozone hydrotherapy followed by ozonated oil; while the contralateral side with tap water and basal oil. Patients' SCORAD scores and modified EASI were recorded before and after treatments. The microbiological compositions in targeting sites were determined using 16S rDNA sequencing.", "After three-day ozone therapy, patients showed a significant decrease in SCORAD scores and inflammatory cell infiltration in AD lesions. The micro-ecological diversity was higher in the non-lesional as compared with lesional areas (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which was also negatively correlated with the severity of AD (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.499, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The proportion of S. aureus in AD lesions was positively correlated with the severity of AD (r\u00a0=\u00a00.564, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010), which was decreased after ozone treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Ozone therapy showed an increase in microbiological diversity with a significant increase in the proportion of Acinetobacter (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "Topical ozone therapy is highly effective for treatment for AD.
