Results suggest that ship-induced ozone contribution to the total surface ozone exceeds 5% over the sea and near the coastline, while an increase up to 5% is simulated over a large portion of the European land. The largest impact (i.e., an increase up to 30%) is simulated over the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, shipping emissions are simulated to increase NO<sub>2</sub> mixing ratio more than 90%, locally, and to modify the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere through hydroxyl radical formation (increase by 20-60% over the sea along the European coasts and near the coastal zone). Therefore, emissions from ships may counteract the benefits derived from the anthropogenic emissions reduction strategies over the continent. Simulations suggest regions where shipping emissions have a major impact on ozone mixing ratio compared to individual anthropogenic emission sector categories. Shipping emissions are estimated to play an important role on ozone levels compared to road transport sector near the coastal zone. The impact of shipping emissions on ozone formation is also profound over a great part of the European land compared to the rest of anthropogenic emission categories."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Western Macedonia, 50132, Kozani, Greece."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, University of Western Macedonia, 50132, Kozani, Greece."}], "LastName": "Tagaris", "ForeName": "Efthimios", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Western Macedonia, 50132, Kozani, Greece."}], "LastName": "Stergiou", "ForeName": "Ioannis", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6319-9577"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Western Macedonia, 50132, Kozani, Greece. rsotiropoulou@uowm.gr."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, University of Western Macedonia, 50132, Kozani, Greece. rsotiropoulou@uowm.gr."}], "LastName": "Sotiropoulou", "ForeName": "Rafaella-Eleni P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Sea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Netherlands"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ships"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2010 Apr 1;44(7):2482-9", "ArticleIdList": ["20210355"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28480490", "10.1007/s11356-017-9046-x", "10.1007/s11356-017-9046-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
