The nanomaterials were characterized using SEM, XRD, EDS, and FT-IR. The effects of nanoparticles size, addition ratio, and number of cycles on the process of ozone oxidation of TC were investigated. The results indicated that the addition ratio of nanoparticles have a certain impact on the performance of ozone oxidation. When the addition ratio increased from 0.02% to 0.4%, the removal rate of TC in the solution was improved significantly. Besides, the particle size of nanoparticles showed a greater impact on ozone oxidation. At the nanoscale, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles exhibited significant strengthening properties, which is attributed to the construction of nanofluid systems. The removal rate of TC in solution decreased obviously with the increase of nanoparticles size. The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with particle size of 20\u2005nm showed the most significant effect on TC degradation. The recycling experiment showed that magnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles had stable regeneration performance. For three times of recycling treatment, with a Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> addition ratio of 0.4%, the removal rate of TC reached 98.7%, 97.21%, and 96%, respectively. Based on the characterization results, the strengthening mechanism was analyzed. The experimental results indicated that construction of nanofluids systems could improve the utilization rate of ozone, and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles were reusable and easily recyclable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agricultural Engineering and Food Science, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mengzhao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agricultural Engineering and Food Science, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Penghao", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jinkai", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Junjie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Wenle", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agricultural Engineering and Food Science, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Peiling", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAPc), Shanghai, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xinpeng", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38584437", "10.1080/09593330.2024.2334771"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
