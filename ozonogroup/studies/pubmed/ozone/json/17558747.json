The sampling sites were selected to be at a great distance from any pollution. At the time of sampling, field data (temperature, relative humidity, average monthly precipitation, and radioactivity) were recorded. delta(13)C in whole lichen specimens were determined using standard mass spectrometric techniques with a standard deviation of+/-0.3 per thousand. We have found a weak but negative correlation between delta(13)C and relative humidity, and a positive correlation between delta(13)C and average monthly precipitation at the studied sites. The effects were minor, of the order of 1.5 per thousand for all the lichens. We have examined the correlation between (137)Cs activity concentration of the studied lichens and delta(13)C of these lichens, and we have suggested that fixation of radiocesium does not alter photosynthesis rate. There was a delta(13)C variation with the altitude gradient with less negative delta(13)C values at higher altitude. It is possible that this difference is caused by the ozone and occurred at the high elevations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Research and Development for Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. cuna@oc1.itim-cj.ro"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cuna", "ForeName": "Stela", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balas", "ForeName": "Gabriela", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hauer", "ForeName": "Elza", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Isotopes Environ Health Stud", "NlmUniqueID": "9602611", "ISSNLinking": "1025-6016"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Isotopes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lichens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microclimate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Romania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17558747", "10.1080/10256010701362401", "779308812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
