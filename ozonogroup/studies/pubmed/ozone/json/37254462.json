Gas byproducts of combustion lead to increased levels of atmospheric ozone and carbon dioxide, which in turn elevate surface temperatures of the earth. This process exposes individuals to respiratory irritants and contributes to increased frequency of natural disasters such as wildfires, negatively impacting respiratory health. Normal physiologic changes in the respiratory system make pregnant people particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. Asthma and allergic rhinitis are 2 common respiratory diseases that can be triggered by poor air quality. Solutions to limit the impact of climate change on respiratory disease include risk mitigation and reduction of fossil fuel consumption on individual, organization, and community levels. Midwives are well positioned as clinicians to educate people about individual strategies to reduce environmental exposure to respiratory irritants and advocate for policy changes to limit future health effects of climate change."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7953-8054"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee."}], "LastName": "Sanders", "ForeName": "Bethany", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5804-3976"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee."}], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Melissa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Midwifery Womens Health", "NlmUniqueID": "100909407", "ISSNLinking": "1526-9523"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Irritants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Irritants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Policy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Air pollution.
