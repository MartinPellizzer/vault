After its release to the troposphere and transport to the stratosphere, its photolysis contributes to the degradation of stratospheric ozone. A better knowledge of chloromethane sources (production) and sinks (degradation) is a prerequisite to estimate its atmospheric budget in the context of global warming. The degradation of chloromethane by methylotrophic communities in terrestrial environments is a major underestimated chloromethane sink. Methylotrophs isolated from soils, marine environments and more recently from the phyllosphere have been grown under laboratory conditions using chloromethane as the sole carbon source. In addition to anaerobes that degrade chloromethane, the majority of cultivated strains were isolated in aerobiosis for their ability to use chloromethane as sole carbon and energy source. Among those, the Proteobacterium <i>Methylobacterium</i> (recently reclassified as <i>Methylorubrum</i>) harbours the only characterisized 'chloromethane utilization' (<i>cmu</i>) pathway, so far. This pathway is not representative of chloromethane-utilizing populations in the environment as <i>cmu</i> genes are rare in metagenomes. Recently, combined 'omics' biological approaches with chloromethane carbon and hydrogen stable isotope fractionation measurements in microcosms, indicated that microorganisms in soils and the phyllosphere (plant aerial parts) represent major sinks of chloromethane in contrast to more recently recognized microbe-inhabited environments, such as clouds. Cultivated chloromethane-degraders lacking the <i>cmu</i> genes display a singular isotope fractionation signature of chloromethane. Moreover, 13CH3Cl labelling of active methylotrophic communities by stable isotope probing in soils identify taxa that differ from the taxa known for chloromethane degradation. These observations suggest that new biomarkers for detecting active microbial chloromethane-utilizers in the environment are needed to assess the contribution of microorganisms to the global chloromethane cycle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg UMR\u00a07156 UNISTRA CNRS, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Genomics, Microbiology (GMGM), Strasbourg, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bringel", "ForeName": "Fran\u00e7oise", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Chaire AFERE, INRA, FARE UMR A614, Reims, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Besaury", "ForeName": "Ludovic", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand (ICCF), UMR6296 CNRS-UCA-Sigma, Clermont-Ferrand, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amato", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Landscape Biogeochemistry - Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research - ZALF, M\u00fcncheberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kr\u00f6ber", "ForeName": "Eileen", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Landscape Biogeochemistry - Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research - ZALF, M\u00fcncheberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kolb", "ForeName": "Steffen", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany, and Heidelberg Center for the Environment HCE, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keppler", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg UMR 7156 UNISTRA CNRS, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Genomics, Microbiology (GMGM), Strasbourg, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vuilleumier", "ForeName": "St\u00e9phane", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg UMR 7156 UNISTRA CNRS, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Genomics, Microbiology (GMGM), Strasbourg, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nadalig", "ForeName": "Thierry", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Curr Issues Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "100931761", "ISSNLinking": "1467-3037"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A6R43525YO", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CmuA protein, Methylobacterium chloromethanicum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Geologic Sediments"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Networks and Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methylobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methylophilaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31166190", "10.21775/cimb.033.149", "cimb.033.149"]}}]}
