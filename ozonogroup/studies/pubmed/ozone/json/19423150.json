This study contains data from a total of 192 samples collected in 2007, from May to October, at six air pollution measurement stations within the area of influence of several chemical and petrochemical industrial plants. The ambient air concentrations of a group of 65 VOCs, some of them ozone precursors, were determined by active sampling into sorbent tubes, thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At the same time, several meteorological parameters were also recorded, and levels of NO, NO(2) and O(3) measured by the automatic stations, have been included in the study as well. Ambient air profiles of the different areas were studied, and the ozone formation dependent on VOCs and NO(2) levels was also analysed, taking into account the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) for different groups of VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departament de Qu\u00edmica Anal\u00edtica i Qu\u00edmica Org\u00e0nica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Campus Sescelades, Marcell\u00ed Domingo s/n, Tarragona, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ras", "ForeName": "Maria Rosa", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marc\u00e9", "ForeName": "Rosa Maria", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borrull", "ForeName": "Francesc", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19423150", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.04.001", "S0048-9697(09)00338-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
