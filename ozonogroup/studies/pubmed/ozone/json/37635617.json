The aim of this study was to investigate the possible preventive role of medical ozone (O) treatment on epidural fibrosis.", "Twenty-four Sprague Dawley rats were randomly split into four groups: control (C), O, laminectomy (L), and L+O groups. Animals in the C group were sacrificed at the beginning of the experiment. The L and L+O groups had L procedure, while O treatment was supplied for the O and O+L groups. After 42 days of follow-up, for histological evaluation and biochemical measurements, the ratio of epidural fibrosis and catalase (CAT) with malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in serum, respectively, were analyzed in terms of statistical differences.", "Histologically, a distinct difference was o bserved in the epidural space after O treatment. A significant difference in epidural fibrosis areas is found to be between the O, L, and O+L groups (P < 0,0001). There was no statistically significant difference between CAT and MDA levels that were obtained by spectrophotometric analysis.", "Histological results suggest that medical O treatment after L can be used as an alternative method to prevent epidural fibrosis. Further studies with wide cohorts and interval measures are required to detail the effects of doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Services and Techniques, Sa\u011fl\u0131k Bilimleri University, Gulhane Health Vocational School, Anaesthesia Program, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Dayanir", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Dayanir", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Emmez", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Emmez", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Uskudar University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Akyol", "ForeName": "S N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Iseri", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Gazi University Faculty of Pharmacy, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Uludag", "ForeName": "O M", "Initials": "OM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kavutcu", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Kyrenia, University of Kyrenia, Cyprus, Republic of Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozogul", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Babacan", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101150032"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ABO Blood-Group System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "ABO Blood-Group System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Laminectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37635617", "10.4103/njcp.njcp_161_23", "NigerJClinPract_2023_26_8_1197_383887"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
