Air pollutants in a major FCIP in the Yangtze River Delta of China within 500 m above ground level (AGL) detected by a sensor package on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The air pollutants including ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), particulate matter (PM), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO), respectively, had been measured through more than one hundred times of vertical flights from Aug. 2020 to Jul. 2021. The concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and CO generally decreased with the height while the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> increased with the height within 500 m AGL. The photochemical reaction resulted in a strong inverse relationship between the vertical profiles of O<sub>3</sub> and that of NO<sub>2</sub>. The concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and TVOCs generally decreased with the height below 100 m AGL and were fully mixed above 100 m AGL. The vertical profiles of different particle sizes were well consistent with the R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.97 between PM<sub>1</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 0.93 between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. The NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations sometimes increased with height maybe due to the influence of temperature inversion layer or long-distance transportation from northern China. The diurnal variations of NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, TVOCs and CO concentrations at different heights within 500 m AGL were basically consistent. The diurnal variations range of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations below 100 m AGL was large and different from other heights, which should be greatly influenced by the local emissions. The unstable atmospheric stability was accompanied by strong photochemical reactions and convective activities, resulting in low concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while high concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
