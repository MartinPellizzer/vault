This complex disease (trait) may be associated with numerous candidate genes. To discern the major gene(s) controlling mortality from acute lung injury, two inbred mouse strains displaying contrasting survival times to 10 parts/million ozone were identified. A/J (A) mice were sensitive [6.6 +/- 1 (SE) h] and C57BL/6J (B) were resistant (20.6 +/- 1 h). The designation for these phenotypes was 13 h, a point that clearly separated their survival time distributions. Our prior segregation studies suggested that survival time to ozone-induced acute lung injury was a quantitative trait, and genetic analysis identified three linked loci [acute lung injury-1, -2, and -3 (Ali1-3, respectively)]. In this report, acute lung injury in A or B mice was characterized histologically and by measuring lung wet-to-dry weight ratios at death. Ozone produced comparable effects in both strains. To further delineate genetic loci associated with reduced survival, a genomewide scan was performed with F(2) mice generated from the A and B strains. The results strengthen and extend our initial findings and firmly establish that Ali1 on mouse chromosome 11 has significant linkage to this phenotype. Ali3 was suggestive of linkage, supporting previous recombinant inbred analysis, whereas Ali2 showed no linkage. Together, our findings support the fact that several genes, including Ali1 and Ali3, control susceptibility to death after acute lung injury. Identification of these loci should allow a more focused effort to determine the key events leading to mortality after oxidant-induced acute lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0056, USA. prowsdr@email.uc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prows", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daly", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shertzer", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leikauf", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30-ES-06096", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T32-ES-07278", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hybridization, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Trait, Heritable"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10444532", "10.1152/ajplung.1999.277.2.L372"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
