The concentration of these potentially estrogenic compounds in raw water entering waterworks (taken from the Llobregat River, NE Spain) ranged from 8.3 to 22 microg/L, with NP2EC being the most abundant compound. Prechlorination reduced the concentration of short-chain ethoxy NPECs and NPEOs by about 25-35% and of NP by almost 90%. However, this reduction of concentrations was partially due to their transformation to halogenated derivatives. After prechlorination, halogenated nonylphenolic compounds represented approximately 13% of the total metabolite pool, of which 97% were in the form of brominated acidic metabolites. The efficiency of further treatment steps to eliminate nonylphenolic compounds (calculated for the sum of all short-chain ethoxy metabolites including halogenated derivatives) was as follows: settling and flocculation followed by rapid sand filtration (7%), ozonation (87%), GAC filtration (73%), and final disinfection with chlorine (43%), resulting in overall elimination ranging from 96 to 99% (mean 98% for four sampling dates). A few of the nonylphenolic compounds (NP, NP1EC, and NP2EC) were also identified in drinking water; however, the residues detected were generally below 100 ng/L, with one exception for NP2EC in November 2001 when a concentration of 215 ng/L was detected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Chemistry, IIQAB-CSIC, c/Jordi Girona 18-26, 08034 Barcelona, Spain. mpeqam@cid.csic.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrovic", "ForeName": "Mira", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diaz", "ForeName": "Alfredo", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ventura", "ForeName": "Francesc", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barcel\u00f3", "ForeName": "Dami\u00e1", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79F6A2ILP5", "NameOfSubstance": "nonylphenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ethyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14572098", "10.1021/es034139w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
