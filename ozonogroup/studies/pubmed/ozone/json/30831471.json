Daily average concentrations of ozone (maximum 8-h average), fine particle matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), meteorological data (including temperature and relative humidity) and daily cardiovascular diseases mortality data were collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017, in all the 13 cities of Jiangsu Province in China. The time-series model linked with Poisson distribution was used to estimate the correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and daily cardiovascular diseases mortality, after adjusting for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and other pollutants. Firstly, we evaluated the acute effects of O<sub>3</sub> on cardiovascular mortality in each city in Jiangsu province, and then we combined the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on cardiovascular disease mortality by meta-analysis. The single-pollutant model indicated that the acute health effects of O<sub>3</sub> in different cities were quite different. After combined the effects of 13 cities, the mortality of cardiovascular diseases increased by 0.983%\uff0895%CI\uff1a0.588-1.377%\uff09for every 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increases of O<sub>3</sub>. O<sub>3</sub> showed the strongest effect on 3-day moving average concentration (Lag 0-3). After adjusting PM<sub>2.5\uff0c</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO, the results were still statistically significant at the multi-city level. The study found that O<sub>3</sub> had a greater effect on women; the elderly population was susceptible and high-education groups were more vulnerable to O<sub>3</sub>, although the differences between different subgroups were insignificant. The dose-response curve showed that the mortality of cardiovascular disease increased with the increase of O<sub>3</sub>. The increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration of atmospheric can increase the daily mortality of cardiovascular diseases in Jiangsu, China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
