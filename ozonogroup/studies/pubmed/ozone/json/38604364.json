However, a narrow focus on carbon dioxide savings in the environmental assessment of AAMs may not be sufficient to achieve a truly sustainable solution. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed insight into midpoint impact categories related to the production of AAMs based on waste precursors and conventional activators, as compared with common cement-based materials. The obtained results point to a higher environmental load of AAMs in several categories, such as ozone layer depletion, primary resource consumption, and terrestrial and aquatic ecotoxicity. In a hypothetical scenario, it is demonstrated that 10\u00a0% replacement of global concrete production by AAMs may result in notably increased emissions of ozone depletion substances (+35\u00a0%) and damage to the aquatic environment (+ 40\u00a0%). The risk for human health can then be higher. As for the aquatic environment, eutrophication can also lead to a significant increase in indirect emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O having a high impact on the greenhouse effect. Hence, the importance of robust interdisciplinary research in the environmental assessment of AAMs should be emphasized, together with the need to use alternative alkaline substances, which would be more environment-friendly than conventional activators."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
