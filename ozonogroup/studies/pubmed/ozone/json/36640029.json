The organic matter contained in the concentrate affects its evaporation crystallisation; therefore, the refractory organics must be removed. In this study, Cu-Co-Mn/AC catalytic ozonation was used to treat reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). With the addition of the Cu-Co-Mn/AC catalyst, the production of \u00b7OH increased by 82 \u03bcmol/L, thereby enhancing the ozonation performance. The pH, ozone dosage, and catalyst dosage all affected the catalytic ozonation performance. By constructing a response surface model, it was found that the catalyst dosage had the most significant effect on the catalytic ozonation performance. The predicted optimal reaction conditions were pH = 9.02, ozone dosage = 1.08 g/L, and catalyst dosage = 1.33 g/L, under which the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal reached a maximum of 81.49%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn; State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Risk Assessment and Control on Chemical Process, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiurong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (Group) Co., LTD, Shanghai 200082, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiaoli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jinyi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qiuyue", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xinyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xueyang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Industrial Wastewater Detoxication and Resource Recovery, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China E-mail: xrchen@ecust.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Linghu", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36640029", "10.2166/wst.2022.420"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
