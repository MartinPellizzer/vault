The gap between the pin and the grid was ~1.1 mm, the length of the grid was ~2.1 mm and the height was ~1.0 mm. The effective pin radius and discharge length were both approximated to be 200 \u03bcm. Ozone generation rates of ~2.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3) mg/s, ~2.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3) mg/s and ~3.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3) mg/s at 1,500 V were calculated for relative humidity (RH) of 35 %, 25 % and 10 % respectively. Analytical ozone generation rate increases as RH decreases and it is consistent with experimental observations. Using target and control petri dishes with E. coli plated agar, the sterilization capability of the micro corona ionizer at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h was evaluated. A ~60 % reduction in bacterial colony was shown with plate counting and its kill radius could be tuned from\u2009~\u200920 mm to ~5 mm by reducing the duty cycle from 100 % to 50 % with 30 min pulse width. The results suggested that the micro corona ionizer might be suitable as a tunable ozone source in wound dressing for chronic wound management."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Anam-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 136-713, Republic of Korea, chuabeelee@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Chua", "ForeName": "Beelee", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Ahjeong", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Microdevices", "NlmUniqueID": "100887374", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2176"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Microtechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24481590", "10.1007/s10544-014-9838-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
