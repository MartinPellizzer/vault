Each reaction was found to be first order in oxidant and in As(III), with 1:1 stoichiometry. FAC-As(III) and O3-As(III) reactions were extremely fast, with pH-dependent, apparent second-order rate constants, k''app, of 2.6 (+/- 0.1) x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) and 1.5 (+/- 0.1) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7, whereas the NH2Cl-As(III) reaction was relatively slow (k''app = 4.3 (+/- 1.7) x 10(-1) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7). Experiments conducted in real water samples spiked with 50 microg/L As(III) (6.7 x 10(-7) M) showed that a 0.1 mg/L Cl2 (1.4 x 10-6 M) dose as FAC was sufficient to achieve depletion of As(III) to <1 microg/L As(III) within 10 s of oxidant addition to waters containing negligible NH3 concentrations and DOC concentrations <2 mg-C/L. Even in a water containing 1 mg-N/L (7.1 x 10(-5) M) as NH3, >75% As(III) oxidation could be achieved within 10 s of dosing 1-2 mg/L Cl2 (1.4-2.8 x 10(-5) M) as FAC. As(III) residuals remaining in NH3-containing waters 10 s after dosing FAC were slowly oxidized (t1/2 > or = 4 h) in the presence of NH2Cl formed by the FAC-NH3 reaction. Ozonation was sufficient to yield >99% depletion of 50 microg/L As(III) within 10 s of dosing 0.25 mg/L O3 (5.2 x 10(-6) M) to real waters containing <2 mg-C/L of DOC, while 0.8 mg/L O3 (1.7 x 10(-5) M) was sufficientfor a water containing 5.4 mg-C/L of DOC. NH3 had negligible effect on the efficiency of As(III) oxidation by O3, due to the slow kinetics of the O3-NH3 reaction at circumneutral pH. Time-resolved measurements of As(III) loss during chlorination and ozonation of real waters were accurately modeled using the rate constants determined in this investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG), 8600 Duebendorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dodd", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vu", "ForeName": "Ngoc Duy", "Initials": "ND"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ammann", "ForeName": "Adrian", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le", "ForeName": "Van Chieu", "Initials": "VC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kissner", "ForeName": "Reinhard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pham", "ForeName": "Hung Viet", "Initials": "HV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "The Ha", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berg", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KW8K411A1P", "NameOfSubstance": "chloramine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16749695", "10.1021/es0524999"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
