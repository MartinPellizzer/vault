The present study uses a multimedia model that the authors developed to estimate toxaphene degradation in the atmosphere over North America. The predicted degradation has strong spatial and temporal variability determined by processes such as emission and transport of technical toxaphene, as well as the complex interactions among many species (e.g., toxaphene, hydroxyl [OH] radicals, and ozone). More toxaphene is degraded in warmer months due to higher concentrations of technical toxaphene (primarily due to higher technical toxaphene emissions in the southeastern United States and transport to other regions) and OH radicals. In the model, OH radicals are created primarily through the reactions of water vapor with the excited oxygen atom, O(\u00b9D), generated by the photolysis of ozone, which is produced primarily by reactions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight. The higher OH concentrations in warmer months are primarily the result of higher solar radiation and ozone concentrations. The spatial distribution of degradation depends on the distribution of technical toxaphene soil residues as well as atmospheric transport and chemistry; significant chemical degradation occurs in the southeastern United States where soils are most heavily contaminated by past applications of toxaphene."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 SETAC."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plants, Soils, and Climate, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "8308958", "ISSNLinking": "0730-7268"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8001-35-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxaphene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solar Energy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toxaphene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23939819", "10.1002/etc.2344"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
