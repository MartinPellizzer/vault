Air pollution is at the top of this threat. Air, the main source of life, is indispensable for humans and living things. Therefore, air pollution causes mass results. Many air pollution studies and many solution techniques have been proposed in the literature to deal with the air pollution problem. In this study, it is called analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information systems (GIS), which is one of the multi-criteria decision making methods used in the investigation of air pollution in I\u011fd\u0131r city center and its four districts: Tuzluca, I\u011fd\u0131r Central, Karakoyunlu, and Aralik. In this study, spatial analysis of the pollutant parameters using the GIS-AHP technique was performed with the help of the data obtained from I\u011fd\u0131r Weather Monitoring Stations. By determining the pollutant parameters, pollution distribution maps were created, and station-based statistics were evaluated with dynamic mapping. For the first time, 15 parameters of weather and topographic features were used. Based on this result, it is obvious that I\u011fd\u0131r center is the worst place in the air pollution problem for GIS-AHP method. It varies for 15 parameters using GIS-AHP, compared with the review of locations on a daily basis. The aim of this study is primarily to investigate possible places of air pollution. Also, by comparing the results of two methods, GIS and AHP, more accurate results are given."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biometry Genetics Unit, Department of Animal Science, Agricultural Faculty, I\u011fd\u0131r University, I\u011fd\u0131r, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sahin", "ForeName": "Fatma", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biometry Genetics Unit, Department of Animal Science, Agricultural Faculty, I\u011fd\u0131r University, I\u011fd\u0131r, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kara", "ForeName": "Mehmet Kaz\u0131m", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diyarbakir Vocational School of Technical Sciences, Depertment of Park and Gardens Plants, Dicle University, Diyarbakir, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Koc", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2862-2453"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electric Electronic Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Igdir University, 76000, Igdir, Turkey. gokhan.sahin@igdir.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Sahin", "ForeName": "G\u00f6khan", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32556979", "10.1007/s11356-020-09710-3", "10.1007/s11356-020-09710-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
