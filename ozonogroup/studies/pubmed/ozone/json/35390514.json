Following a 5-mm surgical wound created on the buccal mucosa, the rats were randomly distributed into 3 groups of 10: (1) ozone group (treated with topical gaseous ozone), (2) laser group (treated with LLLT), and (3) control group (received no treatment). Following the sacrifice of rats on day 21, samples were taken from rats' buccal mucosa for histological assay and scoring. The data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney test.", "Ozone and laser groups demonstrated reduced acute inflammation scores compared to control group (p=.01), while no significant differences were observed between the ozone and laser groups (p\u00a0=\u00a01.00). Similarly, ozone and laser groups showed higher histological tissue repair scores than the control group (p=.00), and no difference was found between ozone and laser groups (p=.76). On the other hand, no significant difference in expression of TNF-\u03b1 (p=.33) and TGF-\u03b21 (p=.13) was identified between ozone, laser and control samples.", "The present study demonstrated that both adjunctive ozone therapy and LLLT with a 940\u00a0nm diode laser provided significant improvement in parameters of acute inflammation and tissue repair in surgical oral mucosal wounds in rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
