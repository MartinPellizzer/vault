Selected previous literature is discussed where relevant in tracing the origins.", "Climate variables and air pollution have a complex interplay in affecting human health. The bulk of the literature we reviewed focuses on the air pollutants ozone and fine particulate matter and temperatures (including hot and cold extremes). The interaction between temperature and ozone presented substantial interaction, but evidence about the interactive effects of temperature with other air pollutants is inconsistent. Most included studies used a time-series design, usually with daily mean temperature and air pollutant concentration as independent variables. Still, more needs to be studied about the co-occurrence of climate and air pollution. The co-occurrence of extreme climate and air pollution events is likely to become an increasing health risk in China and many parts of the world as climate changes. Climate change can interact with air pollution exposure to amplify risks to human health. Challenges and opportunities to assess the combined effect of climate variables and air pollution on human health are discussed in this review. Implications from epidemiological studies for implementing coordinated measures and policies for addressing climate change and air pollution will be critical areas of future work."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024.
