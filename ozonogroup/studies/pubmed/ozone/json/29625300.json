However, knowledge gaps remain concerning the effects of elevated atmospheric N deposition and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) on \u03c7<sub>s</sub> for forest species, resulting in large uncertainties in the parameterizations of NH<sub>3</sub> incorporated into atmospheric chemistry and transport models (CTMs). Here, we present leaf-scale measurements of \u03c7<sub>s</sub> for hybrid poplar clone '546' (Populusdeltoides cv. 55/56 x P. deltoides cv. Imperial) growing in two N treatments (N0, no N added; N50, 50\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> urea fertilizer added) and two O<sub>3</sub> treatments (CF, charcoal-filtered air; E-O<sub>3</sub>, non-filtered air plus 40\u202fppb) for 105 days. Our results showed that \u03c7<sub>s</sub> was significantly reduced by E-O<sub>3</sub> (41%) and elevated N (19%). The interaction of N and O<sub>3</sub> was significant, and N can mitigate the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> on \u03c7<sub>s</sub>. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly reduced the light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A<sub>sat</sub>) and chlorophyll (Chl) content and significantly increased intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Ci), but had no significant effect on stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>). By contrast, elevated N did not significantly affect all measured photosynthetic parameters. Overall, \u03c7<sub>s</sub> was significantly and positively correlated with A<sub>sat</sub>, g<sub>s</sub> and Chl, whereas a significant and negative relationship was observed between \u03c7<sub>s</sub> and Ci. Our results suggest that O<sub>3</sub>-induced changes in A<sub>sat</sub>, Ci and Chl may affect \u03c7<sub>s</sub>. Our findings provide a scientific basis for optimizing parameterizations of \u03c7<sub>s</sub> in CTMs in response to environmental change factors (i.e., elevated N deposition and/or O<sub>3</sub>) in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
