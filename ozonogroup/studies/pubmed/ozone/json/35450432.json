Hourly concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), coarse particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were collected. Hourly onset data of ACS and its subtypes, including ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina, were also obtained. Conditional logistic regressions combined with polynomial distributed lag models were applied.", "Acute exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO were each associated with the onset of ACS and its subtypes. These associations were strongest in the concurrent hour of exposure and were attenuated thereafter, with the weakest effects observed after 15 to 29 hours. There were no apparent thresholds in the concentration-response curves. An interquartile range increase in concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (36.0 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), NO<sub>2</sub> (29.0 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), SO<sub>2</sub> (9.0 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), and CO (0.6 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) over the 0 to 24 hours before onset was significantly associated with 1.32%, 3.89%, 0.67%, and 1.55% higher risks of ACS onset, respectively. For a given pollutant, the associations were comparable in magnitude across different subtypes of ACS. NO<sub>2</sub> showed the strongest associations with all 3 subtypes, followed by PM<sub>2.5</sub>, CO, and SO<sub>2</sub>. Greater magnitude of associations was observed among patients older than 65 years and in the cold season. Null associations of exposure to either PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> with ACS onset were observed.", "The results suggest that transient exposure to the air pollutants PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, or CO, but not PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>, may trigger the onset of ACS, even at concentrations below the World Health Organization air quality guidelines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9448-0820"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and National Health Commission Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University' Shanghai' China (R.C., Y.J., X.M., Y.G., Weidong Wang, C.
