Intensive observations were conducted to investigate the evolution of O<sub>3</sub>, nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and oxygenated organic aerosols ((OOAs), a proxy for secondary organic aerosols) and the interactions between O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> oxidation products (NO<sub>z</sub>) and OOA in urban Beijing in August 2012. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations exhibited similar variations at both the urban and urban background sites in Beijing. Regarding the O<sub>3</sub> profile, the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased with increasing altitude. The peaks in O<sub>3</sub> on the days exceeding the 1h or 8h O<sub>3</sub> standards (polluted days) were substantially wider than those on normal days. Significant increases in the NO<sub>z</sub> mixing ratio (i.e., NO<sub>y</sub> - NO<sub>x</sub>) were observed between the morning and early afternoon, which were consistent with the increasing oxidant level. A discernable NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> peak was also observed in the morning on the polluted days, and this peak was attributed to vertical mixing and strong photochemical production. In addition, a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> peak at 18:00 was likely caused by a combination of local generation and regional transport. The OOA concentration cycle exhibited two peaks at approximately 10:00 and 19:00. The OOA concentrations were correlated well with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ([OOA]=0.55\u00d7[SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>]+2.1, r<sup>2</sup>=0.69) because they both originated from secondary transformations that were dependent on the ambient oxidization level and relative humidity. However, the slope between OOA and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was only 0.35, which was smaller than the slope observed for all of the OOA and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> data, when the RH ranged from 40 to 50%. In addition, a photochemical episode was selected for analysis. The results showed that regional transport played an important role in the evolution of the investigated secondary pollutants. The measured OOA and O<sub>x</sub> concentrations were well correlated at the daily scale, whereas the hourly OOA and O<sub>x</sub> concentrations were insignificantly correlated in urban Beijing. The synoptic situation and the differences in the VOC oxidation contributing to O<sub>3</sub> and SOAs may have resulted in the differences among the correlations between OOA and O<sub>x</sub> at different time scale. We calculated OOA production rates using the photochemical age (defined as -log<sub>10</sub>(NO<sub>x</sub>/NO<sub>y</sub>)) in urban plumes. The CO-normalized OOA concentration increased with increasing photochemical age, with production rates ranging from 1.1 to 8.5\u03bcgm<sup>-3</sup>ppm<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> for the plume from the NCP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
