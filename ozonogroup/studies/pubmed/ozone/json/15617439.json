Therefore, weekly cycles of CO, NO and O3 concentrations for the 18-year-period 1983-2000 are studied. Each day of the week is considered separately, while sites with different levels of primary pollutants are examined. The reduction of the meteorological influence in the O3 mechanisms is achieved by applying meteorological classifications. The analysis for the cold period reveals that CO and NO display decreasing concentrations from weekdays to weekends, whereas O3 shows increasing concentrations. During the warm period, although primary pollutants display decreased concentrations compared to the cold period, their weekly cycles remain the same. On the other hand, meteorological changes affect the weekly cycle of ozone peaks. During days with unfavourable meteorology to ozone production, weekend ozone concentrations are higher than weekday O3 concentrations. The reverse is observed during days with favourable meteorology to ozone production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Meteorology, Department of Physics, University of Ioannina, 451 10 Ioannina, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paschalidou", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kassomenos", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15617439", "10.1080/09593332508618372"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
