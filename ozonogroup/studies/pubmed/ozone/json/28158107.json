Spectroradiometers are the most widely used class of instruments, although the requirement to work in attended stations is sometimes limiting. In this work we present a filter radiometer, named F-RAD, with good optical stability, very short sampling time (1\u00a0min), and proven reliability. The instrument is based on a stand-alone functioning, making it suitable for operation in hostile environments. The total ozone column (TOC) was estimated by the irradiance ratio at wavelengths where the ozone absorbs the solar radiation and where the radiation is not absorbed. Direct correlation between the TOC values estimated by F-RAD and by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was found, and the standard deviations of the ratios between such values were calculated. Three wavelength ratios were identified to take into account the dependence of the measurements from the Solar Zenith Angle, A<sub>F-RAD</sub> (306.0\u00a0nm/325.3\u00a0nm) for SZA<50\u00b0, B<sub>F-RAD</sub> (309.9\u00a0nm/325.3\u00a0nm) and C<sub>F-RAD</sub> (317.5\u00a0nm/325.3\u00a0nm) for SZA>50\u00b0. Considering the OMI ozone data as the reference values, the accuracy of the filter radiometer is estimated to be \u00b14%. The data collected during the calibration campaign in Lampedusa (June-July 2009, Italy) and during the first Antarctica winter of the 2009-2013 measurement campaign at Mario Zucchelli Station (MZS) are reported. The TOC measured by the F-RAD instrument, by the OMI on board of EOS-Aura satellite (NASA), and by the NOAA UV Monitoring Station in McMurdo (USA) are compared to assess the appropriateness of F-RAD for a long-term measurement campaign."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Scaglione", "ForeName": "Salvatore", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zola", "ForeName": "Danilo", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Menchini", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sarcina", "ForeName": "Ilaria Di", "Initials": "ID"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28158107", "10.1364/AO.56.001020", "357697"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
