Salinity caused a substantial reduction in shoot and root dry weight in all varieties, but the effect on root growth was proportionately less than on shoot growth. Ozone reduced root dry weight but the treatment used did not significantly affect shoot dry weight. Both salinity and ozone reduced plant height. The potassium concentration in the leaves of all five varieties was reduced by salinity, and by ozone in both saline and non-saline treatments. Ozone reduced the sodium concentration in plants grown at 50 mM NaCl but had no effect upon the chloride concentration. Carbon dioxide assimilation, transpiration and stomatal conductance were all reduced by salinity and by ozone and there was close quantitative similarity between the effects of ozone and/or salinity upon assimilation, stomatal conductance and transpiration. There were some antagonistic effects but there were additive effects of salinity and of ozone on root dry weight, plant height, shoot potassium concentration, photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance. The possible basis of the additive effects of salinity and ozone on gas exchange and mineral uptake are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, The University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QG, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Welfare", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flowers", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeo", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091377", "10.1016/0269-7491(96)00003-6", "0269749196000036"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
