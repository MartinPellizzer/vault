Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was electropsun into bead-free one-dimensional (1D) nanofibers by electrospinning. The electrospun PAN nanofibers were converted into well-defined 1D CNFs by a two-step carbonization process. We took advantage of an ozone-assisted ALD technique to uniformly decorate the CNF support by highly monodisperse Ru NPs of 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 nm size. The Ru@CNF nanocatalyst system catalyzes the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of methylamine borane (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>BH<sub>3</sub>), which has been considered as one of the attractive materials for the efficient chemical hydrogen storage, with a record turnover frequency of 563 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol Ru \u00d7 min and an excellent conversion (>99%) under air at room temperature with the activation energy ( E<sub>a</sub>) of 30.1 kJ/mol. Moreover, Ru@CNF demonstrated remarkable reusability performance and conserved 72% of its inherent catalytic activity even at the fifth recycle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, National Nanotechnology Research Center (UNAM) , Bilkent University , Ankara 06800 , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khalily", "ForeName": "Mohammad Aref", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Science Faculty , Yuzuncu Y\u0131l University , 65080 Van , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yurderi", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, National Nanotechnology Research Center (UNAM) , Bilkent University , Ankara 06800 , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haider", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Science Faculty , Yuzuncu Y\u0131l University , 65080 Van , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bulut", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, National Nanotechnology Research Center (UNAM) , Bilkent University , Ankara 06800 , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Bhushan", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Science Faculty , Yuzuncu Y\u0131l University , 65080 Van , Turkey."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5633-3811"], "LastName": "Zahmakiran", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, National Nanotechnology Research Center (UNAM) , Bilkent University , Ankara 06800 , Turkey."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3989-4481"], "LastName": "Uyar", "ForeName": "Tamer", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29989394", "10.1021/acsami.8b04822"]}}]}
