Total antioxidant metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activity, and antioxidant transcript abundance were characterized before, immediately after, and during recovery from the acute O(3) treatment. Growth at chronic elevated [O(3)] increased the total antioxidant capacity of plants, while growth at elevated [CO(2)] decreased the total antioxidant capacity. Changes in total antioxidant capacity were matched by changes in ascorbate content, but not phenolic content. The growth environment significantly altered the pattern of antioxidant transcript and enzyme response to the acute O(3) stress. Following the acute oxidative stress, there was an immediate transcriptional reprogramming that allowed for maintained or increased antioxidant enzyme activities in plants grown at elevated [O(3)]. Growth at elevated [CO(2)] appeared to increase the response of antioxidant enzymes to acute oxidative stress, but dampened and delayed the transcriptional response. These results provide evidence that the growth environment alters the antioxidant system, the immediate response to an acute oxidative stress, and the timing over which plants return to initial antioxidant levels. The results also indicate that future elevated [CO(2)] and [O(3)] will differentially affect the antioxidant system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiological and Molecular Plant Biology Program, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 1201 W.
