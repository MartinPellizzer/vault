As early as mid-December and throughout the winter, significant enhancements of this ozone-destroying radical were observed within the polar vortex shortly after temperatures dropped below 195 k. Decreases in ClO observed in February were consistent with the rapid formation of chlorine nitrate (ClONO(2)) by recombination of ClO with nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) released photochemically from nitric acid (HNO(3)). Outside the vortex, ClO abundances were higher than in previous years as a result of NOx suppression by heterogeneous reactions on sulfate aerosols enhanced by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toohey", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avallone", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lait", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newman", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schoeberl", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fahey", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodbridge", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17790345", "10.1126/science.261.5125.1134", "261/5125/1134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
