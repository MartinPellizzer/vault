The University of Wisconsin solution is widely used to preserve ischemia and to preserve organs for transplant. Ozone is used in various areas of ischemia damage due to its antioxidant properties. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of ozone added to University of Wisconsin solution on perfused liver preservation injury.", "Our study included 24 Sprague Dawley rats with an average weight of 300 to 350 g. Animals were divided into 4 groups: group 1 (Ringer lactate), group 2 (Ringer lactate + ozone), group 3 (University of Wisconsin solution), and group 4 (University of Wisconsin + ozone). Solutions were perfused from the liver portal vein and aorta. After perfusion, rats were killed and liver biopsies were taken at 0, 6, and 12 hours of storage for pathological examination. For biochemical analysis, samples were collected from liver specimen storage solutions at 0, 6, and 12 hours.", "Mean alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase levels in group 3 were 77/82 U/L at hour 0, 680/461 U/L at hour 6, and 1027/682 U/L at hour 12. In group 4, these levels were 35/31 U/L at hour 0, 415/295 U/L at hour 6, and 546/372 U/L at hour 12.", "In terms of liver function values, we observed favorable result with University of Wisconsin solution with added ozone. Therefore, we suggest that the addition of ozone to the University of Wisconsin solution may be effective in preventing liver preservation damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Department of General Surgery, Medical School, Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ayd\u0131n", "ForeName": "H\u00fcseyin Onur", "Initials": "HO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ayvazo\u011flu Soy", "ForeName": "Ebru H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tezcaner", "ForeName": "Tugan", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Avc\u0131", "ForeName": "Tevfik", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Erkent", "ForeName": "Murathan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m", "ForeName": "Sedat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haberal", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Exp Clin Transplant", "NlmUniqueID": "101207333", "ISSNLinking": "1304-0855"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35037611", "10.6002/ect.2021.0453"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
