To clarify the carbonyl emissions, the comprehensive characteristics of C1-C10 carbonyl compounds from open burning of seven typical subtropical biomass in China were investigated in this study, which included subtropical plants and agricultural residues. Total 27 carbonyl compounds were detected. The total EFs were 2824\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> with 95% confidence interval (CI) [2418, 3322] for burning subtropical plants and 4080\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> with 95% CI [3446, 4724] for burning agriculture residues, respectively. The EFs were 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than previous values in China. Aliphatic aldehydes were the largest group of carbonyl groups, with acetaldehyde, as the most abundant carbonyl species (about 30% contribution). Formaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, butanone, isovaleraldehyde, and m-tolualdehyde were also found to be abundant and varying with the types of biomass burnt. Formaldehyde emission ratios to acetonitrile and CO were lower than those in previous studies both for burning plants and agricultural residues. There were significant variabilities in the emission ratios and factors among different types of OBBs. Strong positive correlations were found between carbonyl emissions and CO emissions and water content in biomass; furthermore, total carbonyl concentrations measured in the flaming stage were higher than those in the smoldering one. This study provides important fundamental measurement data on carbonyl emissions from burning typical subtropical plants and agricultural residues, which will help improve the quality of emission inventories and better understand the potential impacts of OBB on regional air quality in southern China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
