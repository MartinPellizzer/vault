Its widely use in humans and even in animals releases unmetabolized and active metabolites that have a strong potential in terms of effect in organisms. In this work, 200 mg L(-1) solution of sulfamethoxazole was treated by ozonation at different pH. Results showed that ozonation was proved to be an efficient method to degrade sulfamethoxazole. After 15 min of ozonation (corresponding dose=0.4 g of ozone L(-1)), the complete antibiotic abatement was almost achieved with just 10% of mineralization. The biodegradability and toxicity of the ozonation intermediates were also studied. A biodegradability enhancement (increment of BOD(5)/COD ratio) from 0 to 0.28 was observed after 60 min of ozonation. The acute toxicity of the intermediates was followed by the Microtox test and the toxicity profile showed a slight acute toxicity increment in the first stage of ozonation. The pH variation had an important role in the TOC and COD removal, promoting their growth with the increment of alkalinity. The second order kinetic constants for the ozonation of the SMX in an order of magnitude of 10(5) L mol(-1)s(-1) were also determined for pH 5 and 7."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departament d'Enginyeria Qu\u00edmica, Universitat de Barcelona, Mart\u00ed i Franqu\u00e8s 1, 08028 Barcelona, Spain. falcao@angel.qui.ub.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dantas", "ForeName": "Renato F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Contreras", "ForeName": "Sandra", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sans", "ForeName": "Carme", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Esplugas", "ForeName": "Santiago", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JE42381TNV", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethoxazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17573190", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.05.034", "S0304-3894(07)00752-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
