Monthly concentrations of maximum daily average 8-hour (MDA8) ozone at 0.125\u00b0 \u00d7 0.125\u00b0 resolution were extracted from well-validated spatiotemporal grid dataset. Linear and logistic regression models were employed to evaluate associations of maternal MDA8 ozone exposure with birthweight outcomes. Assuming causality, the comparative risk assessment framework was utilized to estimate the burden of low birthweight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), and birthweight loss per livebirth (BLL) attributable to ambient ozone pollution.", "Of 4030383 livebirths included in the study, 264304 (6.6%) were LBW and 484405 (12.0%) were SGA. Each 10-ppb increase in MDA8 ozone exposure was associated with an odds ratio of 1.123 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.104 to 1.142) for LBW and 1.210 (95% CI: 1.197 to 1.223) for SGA, and a 30.5-g (95% CI: 29.0 to 32.0) reduction in birthweight. We observed approximately linear exposure-response relationships of maternal MDA8 ozone exposure with LBW (P<sub>nonlinear</sub>= 0.786), SGA (P<sub>nonlinear</sub>= 0.156), and birthweight reduction (P<sub>nonlinear</sub>= 0.104). Under the premise of causal association, we estimated 6.6% (95% CI: 5.7 to 7.5) of LBW, 10.1% (95% CI: 9.6 to 10.6) of SGA, and 18.8\u202fg (95% CI: 17.9 to 19.7) of BLL could be attributable to maternal ozone exposure in Iran. Considerably greater risk and burden of ozone-related FGR were observed among younger, less-educated, and rural-dwelling mothers.", "Our study provided compelling evidence that maternal ozone exposure was associated with heightened FGR risk and burden, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers. These findings underscored the urgent need for government to incorporate socioeconomic factors into future ozone-related health policies, not only to mitigate pollution, but also minimize inequality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
