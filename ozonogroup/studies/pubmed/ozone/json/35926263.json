We aimed to study the characteristics of these pollutants in atmospheric PM<sub>2.5</sub> of three Asian countries, including Taiwan (Taipei), Thailand (Chiang Mai), and Vietnam (Hanoi). We carried out a source apportionment analysis to determine significant PCDD/F contributors in these areas. Multiple media model was conducted to access the health impact assessment. The PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in Taipei (n\u00a0=\u00a07), Chiang Mai (n\u00a0=\u00a020), and Hanoi (n\u00a0=\u00a010) were 18.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.21\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 133\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and 88.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.6\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The PCDD/Fs level in Hanoi was 92.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a067.3\u00a0fg I-TEQ/m<sup>3,</sup> and in Taipei and Chiang Mai was 5.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.39\u00a0fg I-TEQ/m<sup>3</sup> and 14.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.1\u00a0fg I-TEQ/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, which showed that the higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was not necessary to follow with higher PCDD/Fs level. In all three cities, the effect of traffic on ambient PCDD/F level was significant (23-25\u00a0%). However, we also observed the specific sources of PCDD/Fs in each city during the sampling periods, namely long-range transport (Taipei, 55\u00a0%), Biomass/open burning (Chiang Mai, 77\u00a0%), and industrial activities (Hanoi, 34\u00a0%). In the carcinogenic risk estimation, the highest median total carcinogenic risk was in Hanoi (5.87\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-6</sup>), followed by Chiang Mai (1.06x10<sup>-6</sup>), and Taipei (2.95\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-7</sup>). Although diet was the major absorption pathway, the food contributor of exposure differed among the three areas due to the difference in food consumption composition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
