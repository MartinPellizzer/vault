The Navier-Stokes equations, Spalart-Allmaras turbulence equation, and convection-diffusion equation were implemented at conditions reflecting inhalation into an adult human lung. Simulation results were used to analyze axial velocity, turbulent viscosity, local fractional uptake, and regional uptake. Axial velocity data revealed a strong laryngeal jet with a reattachment point in the proximal trachea. Turbulent viscosity data indicated that jet turbulence occurred only at high Reynolds numbers and was attenuated by the first bifurcation. Local fractional uptake data affirmed hotspots previously reported at the first carina, and suggested additional hotspots at the glottal constriction and jet reattachment point in the proximal trachea. These laryngeal effects strongly depended on inlet Reynolds number, with maximal effects (approaching 15%) occurring at maximal inlet flow rates. While the increase in the regional uptake caused by the larynx subsided by the end of the model, the effect of the larynx on cumulative uptake persisted further downstream. These results suggest that with prolonged exposure to a reactive gas, entire regions of the larynx and proximal trachea could show signs of tissue injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Graduate Degree Program in Physiology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Padaki", "ForeName": "Amit", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ultman", "ForeName": "James S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borhan", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P01 ES011617", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P01 ES011617-04", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Eng Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9883937", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2509"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Fluent 6.3 Users Guide.
