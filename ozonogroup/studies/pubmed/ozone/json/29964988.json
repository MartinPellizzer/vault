The current study investigated the removal efficiencies of 30 frequently detected PPCPs by two river water bypass treatment processes (CS-BAF-UF-Ozone and CS-MBR-Ozone), and investigated the removal mechanism and eco-toxicological risk variation of target compounds via section-removal investigation and risk quotient model, respectively. Results indicated that both processes could efficiently remove the target PPCPs; the removal rates of tetracyclines and caffeine were>90% in the biological sections, while sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and other pharmaceuticals could only be efficiently removed when the COD of the influent and the water temperature were comparatively higher; the ozone process had particular effect on removing these compounds. The cumulative removal rate of all PPCPs during the whole process was higher than 92.5%. The total risk quotient (RQ<sub>tot</sub>) of target PPCPs could be efficiently reduced by the bypass treatment processes; the RQ<sub>tot</sub> decreased from 12.6 in the influent river water to 0.2 in the ozone effluent, with a removal rate of 98.4%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Enterprises Water Group(China) Investment Limited, Beijing 100102, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Enterprises Water Group(China) Investment Limited, Beijing 100102, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Enterprises Water Group(China) Investment Limited, Beijing 100102, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Enterprises Water Group(China) Investment Limited, Beijing 100102, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Enterprises Water Group(China) Investment Limited, Beijing 100102, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qi", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Enterprises Water Group(China) Investment Limited, Beijing 100102, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hong-Li", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Enterprises Water Group(China) Investment Limited, Beijing 100102, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ling-Yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Jian-E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cosmetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cosmetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964988", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201707092"]}}]}
