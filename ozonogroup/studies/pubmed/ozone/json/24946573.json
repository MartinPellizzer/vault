The additional use of the biotrickling filter to NTP reactor not only leads to the enhancement of hydrogen sulfide removal efficiency up from 83.4% to 90.1%, but also eliminates gas-phase intermediate products from NTP degradation of H2S to produce sulfate and H2O. The dynamic changes of microbial community in BTF influenced by ozone from NTP were assessed by PCR-DGGE. Results show that the microbial community was affected by ozone. After the integration, a part of microorganisms disappeared, and meanwhile some new microorganisms appeared. The microbial community structure in BTF changed from eight bands to nine bands; three bands which have the functions of desulfurization disappeared and four bands which have the functions of desulfurization appeared; five bands which have the functions of desulfurization and sulfate reduction were unchanged. The bacterial groups in the BTF unit of NTP-BTF system include Uncultured Thiobacillus sp., Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strain dfI, Uncultured Thiobacillus sp., Uncultured Acidiphilium sp., Uncultured Xanthomonadaceae bacterium clone SBLE6C12, Uncultured 8-Proteobacterium and Paracraurococcus sp. 1PNM-27."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hua-Qin", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jue-Cong", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhou-Yang", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bao-Ren", "Initials": "BR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qian-Ru", "Initials": "QR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zai-Li", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Zai-Shan", "Initials": "ZS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YY9FVM7NSN", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24946573"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
