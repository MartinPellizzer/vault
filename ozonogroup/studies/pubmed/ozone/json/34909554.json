Few studies have investigated its impact on children's academic performance on a nationwide level. We hypothesize that higher ambient air pollution concentrations will be associated with lower average academic test scores.", "We investigated three prevalent ambient air pollutants: PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and ozone, and their associations with the average academic test scores, at the Geographic School District (GSD) level, of the third to eighth grade students in the United States from 2010 to 2016. We applied multivariate linear regression and controlled for urbanicity, socioeconomic status, student racial/ethnic compositions, and individual intercepts for each district-grade level and each year.", "We found that an interquartile range increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations was associated with a 0.007 (95% confidence interval: 0.005, 0.009) SD lower average math test scores, and a 0.004 (95% confidence interval: 0.002, 0.005) SD lower average English language/arts test scores. Similar associations were observed for NO<sub>2</sub> and ozone on math, and for NO<sub>2</sub> on English language/arts. The magnitudes of these associations are equivalent to the effects of short-term reductions of thousands of dollars in district median household income. The reductions in test scores were larger for GSDs with higher socioeconomic status, though most associations remained negative at all socioeconomic levels.", "Our results show that ambient air pollution within a GSD is associated with lower academic performance among children. Further improving air quality may benefit children's overall academic achievement and socioeconomic attainment across the lifespan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
