We prepared a flexible plasma patch (FPP) using printed electronics techniques and tested transdermal delivery enhancement of a water emulsion in agarose gel in an<i>in vitro</i>tissue model. At room temperature, the FPP generated cold air plasma, which supplied reactive oxygen species such as ozone on the surface of the agarose gel. The FPP treatment was effective in enhancing the water emulsion transport into the agarose gel. The penetration depth of the emulsion in the non-plasma-treated 3% agarose gel model was approximately 0.69 mm while that of the plasma-treated model was approximately 1.21 mm."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Nano-Surface Department, Surface Technology Division, Korea Institute of Materials Science, Changwon 51518, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3141-0566"], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yu Ri", "Initials": "YR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Nano-Surface Department, Surface Technology Division, Korea Institute of Materials Science, Changwon 51518, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1356-2331"], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seunghun", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Nano-Surface Department, Surface Technology Division, Korea Institute of Materials Science, Changwon 51518, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Do-Geun", "Initials": "DG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Phys Eng Express", "NlmUniqueID": "101675002", "ISSNLinking": "2057-1976"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34170853", "10.1088/2057-1976/ab2bad"]}}]}
