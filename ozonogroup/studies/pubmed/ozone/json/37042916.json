Light is the key factor for algae growth, but the light masking in sewage will cause low efficiency of the system. This study designed laboratory scale experiments with Chlorella to investigate the influence of cerium on the nutrient removal by algae wastewater treatment system under different light intensities. The best removal rates of NH<sub>4</sub>-N, TP, and COD were 72.43%, 88.87%, and 68.08% under 50\u00a0\u00b5mol/(m <sup>2</sup>\u00b7s) light intensity and 1\u00a0mg/L Ce. Low concentration of Ce could activate protein synthesis, electron transfer, and antioxidase, while excessive Ce might cause toxicity which could be relieved by strong light for energy supply and further activating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Comparing to other similar experiences, this system reached an equal or greater performance on nutrients removal with better efficiency in light utilization. It might provide a new idea for microalgae-based system development."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
