Salt marsh ecosystems including halophyte plants are a known source of atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>Cl but estimates of their total global source strength are highly uncertain and knowledge of the major production and consumption processes in the atmosphere-halophyte-soil system is yet incomplete. In this study we investigated the halophyte plant, Salicornia europaea, and soil samples from a coastal salt marsh site in Sardinia/Italy for their potential to emit and consume CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and using flux measurements, stable isotope techniques and Arrhenius plots differentiated between biotic and abiotic processes. Our laboratory approach clearly shows that at least 6 different production and consumption processes are active in controlling atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>Cl fluxes of a salt marsh ecosystem. CH<sub>3</sub>Cl release by dried plant and soil material was substantially higher than that from the fresh material at temperatures ranging from 20 to 70 \u00b0C. Results of Arrhenius plots helped to distinguish between biotic and abiotic formation processes in plants and soils. Biotic CH<sub>3</sub>Cl consumption rates were highest at 30 \u00b0C for plants and 50 \u00b0C for soils, and microbial uptake was higher in soils with higher organic matter content. Stable isotope techniques helped to distinguish between formation and degradation processes and also provided a deeper insight into potential methyl moiety donor compounds, such as S-adenosyl-l-methionine, S-methylmethionine and pectin, that might be involved in the abiotic and biotic CH<sub>3</sub>Cl production processes. Our results clearly indicate that cycling of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl in salt marsh ecosystems is a result of several biotic and abiotic processes occurring simultaneously in the atmosphere-plant-soil system. Important precursor compounds for biotic and abiotic CH<sub>3</sub>Cl formation might be methionine derivatives and pectin. All formation and degradation processes are temperature dependent and thus environmental changes might affect the strength of each source and sink within salt marsh ecosystems and thus considerably alter total fluxes of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl from salt marsh ecosystems to the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 234-236, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany. frank.keppler@geow.uni-heidelberg.de."}], "LastName": "Keppler", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "R\u00f6hling", "ForeName": "Amelie Ninja", "Initials": "AN", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jaeger", "ForeName": "Nicole", "Initials": "N", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schroll", "ForeName": "Moritz", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hartmann", "ForeName": "Simon Christoph", "Initials": "SC", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Greule", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A6R43525YO", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wetlands"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32080692", "10.1039/c9em00540d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
