Soil emissions have been considered as a potential source of HONO. Lately, the HONO emission via soil-atmosphere exchange (E<sub>SA-exchange</sub>) from soil nitrite has been validated and quantified through chamber experiments, but has not been assessed in the real atmosphere. We coupled E<sub>SA-exchange</sub> and the other seven potential sources of HONO (i.e., traffic, indoor and soil bacterial emissions, heterogeneous reactions on ground and aerosol surfaces, nitrate photolysis, and acid displacement) into the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), and found that diurnal variations of the soil emission flux at the Wangdu site were well simulated. During the non-fertilization period, E<sub>SA-exchange</sub> contributed \u223c28\u00a0% and\u00a0\u223c35\u00a0% of nighttime and daytime HONO, respectively, and enhanced the net ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) production rate by \u223c8\u00a0% across the North China Plain (NCP). During the preintensive/intensive fertilization period, the maximum E<sub>SA-Exchange</sub> contributions attained \u223c70\u00a0%/83\u00a0% of simulated HONO in the afternoon across the NCP, definitely asserting its dominance in HONO production. E<sub>SA-Exchange</sub> enhanced the OH production rate via HONO photolysis by \u223c3.5/7.0 times, and exhibited an increase rate of \u223c13\u00a0%/20\u00a0% in the net O<sub>3</sub> production rate across the NCP. The total enhanced O<sub>3</sub> due to the eight potential HONO sources ranged from \u223c2 to 20\u00a0ppb, and E<sub>SA-exchange</sub> produced O<sub>3</sub> enhancements of \u223c1 to 6\u00a0ppb over the three periods. Remarkably, the average contribution of E<sub>SA-exchange</sub> to the total O<sub>3</sub> enhancements remained \u223c30\u00a0%. This study suggests that E<sub>SA-exchange</sub> should be included in three-dimensional chemical transport models and more field measurements of soil HONO emission fluxes and soil nitrite levels are urgently required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
