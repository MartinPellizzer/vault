The effects on knowledge about epilepsy, attitude to epilepsy, depression scales, and quality of life were investigated.", "Thirty-five PWE participated in a lecture-style educational program using an original knowledge-oriented textbook. All patients were administered a total of four rating scales: the Knowledge about Epilepsy Scale (KES), the Attitude toward Epilepsy Scale (AES), and the Japanese version of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31-P), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The KES and AES of patients (pKES and pAES) were compared to those of medical students (St) and residents (Rd).", "After education, pKES improved and showed significant differences among pre-and post-education and six months later. Before education, pKES was inferior to St and Rd. However, after education, pKES changed and became superior to St and Rd. Six months later, the advantage was lost, but not significantly. PAES also improved after education, with significant differences before, after, and six months later after education. PAES was statistically inferior to St and Rd before education, but the difference disappeared after education, and the effect persisted after six months. The non-depressed (BDI\u00a0<\u00a020) and depressed groups (BDI\u00a0\u2267\u00a020) improved in the KES after education. About the AES, the non-depressive group has a statistical tendency, but not the depressive group. At six months, the depressed group's AES is significantly lower than the non-depressed group.", "While correct knowledge about epilepsy can improve attitudes and perceptions of epilepsy in PWE, special measures are needed for PWE with depression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
