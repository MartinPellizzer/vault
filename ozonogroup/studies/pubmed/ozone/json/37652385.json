Ecological retrospective time series study 01-01-2013 to 31-12-2018). Dependent variables: daily emergency hospitalisations due to kidney disease (KD), acute kidney injury (AKI), lithiasis (L), dysnatraemia (DY) and hypovolaemia (HPV). Independent variables: maximum and minimum daily temperature (Tmax, Tmin, \u00b0C), and daily relative humidity (RH, %). Other variables were also calculated, such as the daily temperature for risk of kidney disease (Theat, \u00b0C) and low daily hazardous relative humidity (HRH%). As variables of air pollution, we used the daily mean concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in \u03bcg/m3. Based on these, we then calculated their daily excesses over World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline levels (<sub>h</sub>PM<sub>10</sub>, <sub>h</sub>PM<sub>2.5</sub>, <sub>h</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> and <sub>h</sub>O<sub>3</sub> respectively). Poisson family generalised linear models (GLMs) (link\u00a0=\u00a0log) were used to calculate relative risks (RRs), and attributable risks and attributable admissions. In the models, we controlled for the covariates included: seasonalities, trend, autoregressive component, day of the week, month and year. A statistically significant association was found between Theat and all the dependent variables analysed. The greatest AKI disease burden was attributable to Theat (2.2\u00a0% (1.7, 2.6) of attributable hospital admissions), followed by <sub>h</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> (1.7\u00a0% (0.9, 3.4)) and HRH (0.8 (0.6, 1.1)). In the case of hypovolaemia and dysnatraemia, the greatest disease burden again corresponded to Theat, with 6.9\u00a0% (6.2, 7.6) and 5.7 (4.8, 6.6) of attributable hospital admissions respectively. Episodes of extreme heat exacerbate daily emergency hospital admissions due to kidney disease and kidney-related conditions; and attributable risks are likewise seen for low relative humidity and high ozone levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
