However, the effects of long-term exposure to ambient ozone on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain inconclusive.", "To estimate the associations of long-term exposure to maximum daily 8-hours average ozone (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) with the incidence of total CVD, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke.", "This was a prospective cohort study, and the data was obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) implemented during 2011-2018 and the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) implemented during 2010-2018. We applied a Cox proportional hazards regression model to evaluate the associations of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> with total CVD, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke risks, and the corresponding population-attributable fractions (PAF) attributable to MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> were also calculated. All analyses were conducted by R software.", "The mean MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concertation of all included participants in the CHARLS and CFPS were 51.03 part per billion (ppb) and 51.15\u202fppb, respectively. In the CHARLS including 18,177 participants, each 10\u202fppb increment in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with a 31% increase [hazard ratio (HR)\u202f=\u202f1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.42] in the risk of incident heart disease, and the corresponding population-attributable fractions (PAF) was 13.79% [10.12%-17.32%]. In the CFPS including 30,226 participants, each 10\u202fppb increment in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with an increase in the risk of incident total CVD (1.07 [1.02-1.13]), and hypertension (1.10 [1.03-1.18]). The PAFs of total CVD, and hypertension attributable to MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> were 3.53% [0.82%-6.16%], and 5.11% [1.73%-8.38%], respectively. Stratified analyses showed greater associations in males, urban areas, and Southern China.", "Long-term exposure to MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> may increase the incidence of CVD.
