All patients underwent the interventional fallopian tube recanalization. The patients in the experimental group underwent the fallopian tube perfusion by the ozone water. Meanwhile, the patients in the control group were treated with the conventional anti-inflammatory and anti-adhesion drugs. After the follow-up visit for 6 months, the pregnancy rate and fallopian tube re-occlusion rate were counted and compared between the two groups. Meanwhile, the symptoms were evaluated and compared between the two groups after the operation for two weeks.", "The success rate of fallopian tube recanalization was 93.1% (54/58), the pregnancy rate was 79.3% (46/58) and the recurrence rate was 5.2% (3/58) in the experimental group. While the success rate of fallopian tube recanalization was 91.4% (53/58), the pregnancy rate was 60.3% (35/58) and the recurrence rate was 17.2% (10/58) in the control group. Analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the recanalization success rate between the two groups (P>0.05). However, the pregnancy rate and re-occlusion rate in the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.05), and the difference was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in the discomfort symptoms between the experimental group and control group (P>0.05).", "Fallopian tube recanalization by ozone perfusion can effectively increase the postoperative pregnancy rate and reduce the fallopian tube re-occlusion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Niuniu Sun, Department of Humanities, School of Nursing, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471023, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Niuniu", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lequn Wei, Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China., The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471003, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Lequn", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diansen Chen, The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471003, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Diansen", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wanqin Gao, The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471003, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wanqin", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huanzhang Niu, The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471003, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Huanzhang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chao He, Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712000, China., Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100913117", "ISSNLinking": "1681-715X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Nsonwu-Anyanwu AC, Charles-Davies MA, Bello FA, Taiwo VO, Bin L, Oni AA.
