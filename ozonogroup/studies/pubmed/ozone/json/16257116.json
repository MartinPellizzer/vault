The results showed that the presence of TiO2 improved ozone utilization and biodegradability of the effluent. For the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal, TiO2/UV/O3-BAC was more efficient than UV/O3-BAC and its synergetic effect is more than that in UV/O(3)-BAC process. It was showed that small molecules with MW<3000 Da predominated in the raw water accounting for more than 56% DOC, they were increased after oxidation, accounting for more than 64% DOC. GC/MS analysis showed that TiO2/UV/O3-BAC process was effective in removing phthalate esters (PAEs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). PAEs' removal ratio reached more than 94% and reduced with the increase of the length of the alkyl side chains and the alkyl branch chains. TiO2/UV/O3-BAC process was also very effective in removing POPs. Polybromobiphenyls' removal rate reached more than 89% and decreased with the increase of substitutional bromines except for 2,2',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl, which can be completely removed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, China. llsh99@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Laisheng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wanpeng", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pengyi", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiuyun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zulin", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6O7F7IX66E", "NameOfSubstance": "phthalic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16257116", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2005.07.050", "S0304-3894(05)00445-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
