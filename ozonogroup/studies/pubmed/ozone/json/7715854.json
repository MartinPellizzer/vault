Pairs of same-sex adult male and female mice were continuously exposed for 13 days to either 0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.2 ppm O3. The exposure apparatus consisted of a system for O3 production and delivery into four stainless-steel chambers, each equipped to contain up to 24 home cages, with continuous monitoring and recording of concentrations. Acute behavioral changes were assessed during the first hour of O3 exposure without removing animals from the chambers. The onset of exposure produced remarkable behavioral disturbances consisting of a sharp increase of several responses (rearing, sniffing, grooming, feeding, and social interactions) paralleled by a reduction of bar-holding. These changes were rapidly reversed within 1 hour, suggesting that they constituted a response to strong novel stimulation followed by habituation. Subsequently, brief sessions of videorecording of the animals' activities in freshly cleaned cages (identical to the home cages) were performed outside the chambers after 3, 7, and 10 days of exposure. These tests showed a significant concentration-dependent increase of grooming and rearing and a decrease of crossing and wall climbing. Both food and water intake showed a nonmonotonic trend over time consisting of a concentration-dependent depression (for about 3 and 7 days, respectively) followed by recovery; body weight followed a similar trend. The detailed study of various components of the animal's behavioral repertoire, showing concentration-dependent and time-dependent changes in different directions, appears to be a sensitive tool in the analysis of pollutants' effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Behavioral Pathophysiology, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Musi", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dell'Omo", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ricceri", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santucci", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laviola", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bignami", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alleva", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Neurotoxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "7905589", "ISSNLinking": "0161-813X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Behavior"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7715854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
