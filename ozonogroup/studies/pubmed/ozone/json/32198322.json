The interactive effects of the influencing factors (dye concentration = 500-2,000 mg/L; time = 10-30 min; pH = 7.0-11.0) on degradation efficiency was critically examined through experimental design optimization by central composite design under the response surface methodology. The high correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.976 & adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.958) obtained by analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated close fit between the experimental and the predicted values. Optimized conditions under specified cost-driven restraints were obtained for the highest desirability (i.e. degradation of 1,210.59 mg/L dye) at pH = 11.0, initial dye concentration = 2,000 mg/L and ozone exposure time of 27.16 min. The degradation of Direct Red 81 was confirmed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and UV-Vis spectrometry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Research, Department of Biotechnology, Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, Madurai, Tamilnadu, India E-mail: vcpadmanaban88@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Muniyasamy", "ForeName": "Abaranjitha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Research, Department of Biotechnology, Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, Madurai, Tamilnadu, India E-mail: vcpadmanaban88@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Sivaporul", "ForeName": "Gayathri", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Research, Department of Biotechnology, Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, Madurai, Tamilnadu, India E-mail: vcpadmanaban88@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Gopinath", "ForeName": "Abarna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Research, Department of Biotechnology, Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, Madurai, Tamilnadu, India E-mail: vcpadmanaban88@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "John", "ForeName": "Juliana", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Research, Department of Biotechnology, Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, Madurai, Tamilnadu, India E-mail: vcpadmanaban88@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Achary", "ForeName": "Anant", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Research, Department of Biotechnology, Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, Madurai, Tamilnadu, India E-mail: vcpadmanaban88@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Chellam", "ForeName": "Padmanaban Velayudhaperumal", "Initials": "PV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7E49Q56PNB", "NameOfSubstance": "Direct Red 81"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32198322", "10.2166/wst.2019.423"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
