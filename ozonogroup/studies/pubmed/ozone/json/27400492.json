Solar radiation study, as the prerequisite to carry out aerospace activity, is facing the barrier of lacking of observation in near space layer. Ozone is the most important factor that affects radiation value in this layer. Based on ECMWF reanalysis data, this input key parameter and its horizontal, vertical and temporal characteristics are analyzedwith results showing obvious regional features in temporal-spatial distribution and varieties. With meteorological data and surface parameters, near space over China is divided into 5 parts. Key factors' value is confirmed over each division. With SBDART radiation transfer model, solar radiation and ultraviolet radiation simulation in near space are conducted separately. Results show that it is influenced by latitude, total ozone and its vertical distribution, radiation varies under complex rules. The average year and monthly solar radiation strengthens changes with latitude reduction, while annual range changes reversely. Air absorbing is related to latitude and land-sea contrast and shows different values and seasonal variations. The ultraviolet radiation over South China Sea reaches its maximum value and minimum annual range, as well as minimum monthly range with value strengthening in summer and weakening in winter. In other areas radiation increases in summer while weakens in winter, monthly range shows double peaks with higher value in spring and autumn, lower in summer and winter. Air absorption in ultraviolet radiation is influenced by multiple factors, vertical varieties over areas besides South China Sea enhance in summer time. The vertical changes of monthly ranges affected by air absorption show consistence in higher and lower layer in June and July, while in other months ranges are bigger in higher layer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Xiao-dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Ji-lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zheng-qiang", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xing-feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qie", "ForeName": "Li-li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27400492"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
