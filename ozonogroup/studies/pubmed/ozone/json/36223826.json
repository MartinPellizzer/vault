Herein, non-noble metal WC@WO<sub>3</sub> as cocatalyst was composited with CeO<sub>2</sub> to optimize photochemical and photothermal conversion for the catalytic ozonation of toluene and acetone. The photothermal conversion efficiencies of visible and infrared lights on 20%WC@WO<sub>3</sub>-CeO<sub>2</sub> were 2.2 and 10.4 times higher than those on CeO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, which indicates that the equilibrium temperature of the catalyst remarkably increased under full-spectrum light irradiation. Moreover, WC@WO<sub>3</sub> transferred electrons to CeO<sub>2</sub> in 20%WC@WO<sub>3</sub>-CeO<sub>2</sub> and thus remarkably improved the activity of catalytic sites. The synergy factor of light and O<sub>3</sub> on 20%WC@WO<sub>3</sub>-CeO<sub>2</sub> was 5.8, and the reaction rate of toluene and acetone reached 9274.5 and 35779.0 mg/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2219min), respectively. This work provides a low-cost and high-efficient catalyst for the utilization of solar energy for VOC control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
