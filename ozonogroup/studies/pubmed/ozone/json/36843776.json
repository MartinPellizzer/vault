Until 15 years ago, surgery was the treatment of choice. However, conservative measures are now preferred because of the large number of post-surgical complications, in addition to the many conditions where surgery cannot be performed. Objective The aim of our study is to determine the effectiveness of transformational epidural injection of ozone (TFEOI) in the management of CLBP among the Lebanese population in the Nabatieh area in comparison with patients who received transformational epidural steroid injection (TFESI). Methods A one-year (2016-2017) retrospective study where 100 patients with CLBP were selected from two hospitals (Alnajdah, and Ragheb Harb hospitals) and divided into two groups. Fifty patients were treated with Ozone injections while the other 50 were treated with steroid injections. For each patient, we recorded the type of pain, irradiation, paresthesia, and the type of injection given (steroid or Ozone). We used the patients' files and contacted them via phone calls. The results of this study were reached based on Vas Score and Mac Nab criteria which are subjective questionnaires. Results The study showed that the TFESI was effective for a short duration (86% of results were excellent and good after one month of injection, but they decreased to 16% after six months). On the other hand, TFEOI was effective over both short and long duration (82% excellent and good after one month, 64% excellent and good after six months). Conclusion Results from this study provide that ozone injection has high benefits in the management of CLBP in the Lebanese population."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Chemeisani et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurological Surgery, Lebanese University Faculty of Medicine, Hadath, LBN."}], "LastName": "Chemeisani", "ForeName": "Ammar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicine, Lebanese University, Hadath, LBN."}], "LastName": "Tarhini", "ForeName": "Hasan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Lebanese University Faculty of Medicine, Hadath, LBN."}], "LastName": "Haj Ali", "ForeName": "Thuraya", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatrics, Rafik Hariri University Hospital, Beirut, LBN."}], "LastName": "Jibbawi", "ForeName": "Ali A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Medicine, Lebanese University Faculty of Medicine, Hadath, LBN."}], "LastName": "Yehya", "ForeName": "Khalil", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurological Surgery, Zahraa Hospital UMC, Lebanese University Faculty of Medicine, Beirut, LBN."}], "LastName": "Msheik", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Intraforaminal O2-O3 versus periradicular steroidal infiltrations in lower back pain: randomized controlled study.
