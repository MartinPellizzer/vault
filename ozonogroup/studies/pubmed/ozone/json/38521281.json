Using the same datasets applied to the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model by (Hua et al., 2023), the initial concentrations of HCHO were estimated using the photochemical age and the sources of observed and initial HCHO were apportioned based on multiple linear regression (MLR) and photochemical age-based parameterization (PCAP) methods. These results suggest that the source of the initial HCHO can better reflect its contribution. The secondary formation contributed to 49.3-69.1\u00a0% of initial HCHO at four sites in Taiyuan based on MLR, which was higher (7.4-36.2\u00a0%) than the contributions of secondary formation from observed HCHO. The HCHO was mainly affected by anthropogenic secondary (10.8-34.4\u00a0%) and background sources (17.4-78.7\u00a0%) based on the PCAP method. We compared the results of the HCHO sources from the MLR, PCAP, and PMF models under photochemical loss. There was good agreement among the emission ratios of acetylene-based HCHO obtained by the different methods at the four sites. The correlation analysis of different source apportionment methods illustrated that primary emissions from the PCAP and the MLR model had the greatest correlation (0.22-0.60). Secondary formations from the PMF and MLR models showed good correlations at all four sites, with R values ranging from 0.42 to 0.83. The HCHO peak of diurnal variation simulated by MLR appeared late compared to the other methods, and the difference in daily variation of HCHO from the PMF model was significantly higher than that of PCAP and MLR. The overlapping conclusions of different source apportionment methods should be considered and used to guide efforts to improve air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
