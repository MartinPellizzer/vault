Such estimations are components of the assessment process for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances, which are also referred to as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). An ecological exposure assessment for ENB from manufacturing activities was conducted based on physical/chemical properties, monitoring data, and degradation, transport and distribution estimates. Based on the results of several model predictions, chronic exposure of aquatic organisms is not expected, due to the anticipated residence time of ENB in aquatic ecosystems. These modeled results consistently predict ENB does not present the potential to persist in the environment. Volatilization from water to the air is calculated to occur at a relatively rapid rate for ENB based on its Henry's Law constant. Once in the air, ENB is expected to degrade rapidly due to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and ozone based on calculated atmospheric half-lives of 57 and 27 min, respectively. Additionally, ENB is not predicted to undergo long-range transport based on the short atmospheric half-life due to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and ozone. Additionally, based on predicted exposure from site-specific emission using the EPA model EFAST, ENB is not expected to reach concentrations of concern for chronic aquatic toxicity endpoints."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Inc., 1545 Route 22 East, Annandale, NJ 08801-0971, USA. carolyn.lee@exxonmobil.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Carolyn", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caldwell", "ForeName": "Daniel J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winkelmann", "ForeName": "Douglas A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Norbornanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16219-75-3", "NameOfSubstance": "5-ethylidene-2-norbornene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-04-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Rubber"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Norbornanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rubber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15172601", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.02.021", "S0045-6535(04)00136-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
