We evaluated the effect of combined allergen sensitization and ozone exposure on eliciting spatial differences in lipid distribution in the mouse lung that may contribute to ozone-induced exacerbations in asthma. Lung lobes from male and female BALB/c mice were cryosectioned and acquired by high resolution mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Processed MSI peak annotations were validated by LC-MS/MS data from scraped tissue slides and microdissected lung tissue. Images were normalized and segmented into clusters. Interestingly, segmented clusters overlapped with stained serial tissue sections, enabling statistical analysis across biological replicates for morphologically relevant lung regions. Spatially distinct lipids had higher overall degree of unsaturated fatty acids in distal lung regions compared to proximal regions. Furthermore, the airway and alveolar epithelium exhibited significantly decreased sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid abundance in females, but not in males. We demonstrate the potential role of lipid saturation in healthy lung function and highlight sex differences in regional lung lipid distribution following ozone exposure. Our study provides a framework for future MSI experiments capable of relative quantification across biological replicates and expansion to multiple sample types, including human tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7497-6629"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stevens", "ForeName": "Nathanial C", "Initials": "NC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martinez", "ForeName": "Joshua", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Veneese J B", "Initials": "VJB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Domanico", "ForeName": "Morgan C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6078-3321"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Neumann", "ForeName": "Elizabeth K", "Initials": "EK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1689-4446"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Winkle", "ForeName": "Laura S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6261-8928"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fiehn", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Preprint"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "bioRxiv", "NlmUniqueID": "101680187", "ISSNLinking": "2692-8205"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39026864", "PMC11257454", "10.1101/2024.07.05.602264", "2024.07.05.602264"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
