Rats fed diets wither E-deficient or supplemented with 1000 IU E/kg were exposed to 0.5 +/- 0.05 ppm O3 or filtered room air continuously for 5 days. They were then sacrificed and their lungs were analyzed for biochemical changes. Lung E content was strongly associated with the dietary level, and increased (36%, P less than 0.05) after O3 exposure only in E-supplemented rats. Lung polyamine metabolism was not affected in the air-control rats by E level, but increased after O3 exposure in both dietary groups. The activities of ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase were elevated above air controls. However, the increases were significant only for E-deficient rats when compared to E-supplemented rats. After O3 exposure, putrescine increased significantly in both dietary groups; spermidine increased but was significantly higher only in the E-deficient group; and spermine remained unchanged in both dietary groups. Elevated E content of supplemented rat lungs after O3 exposure may represent its mobilization under oxidant stress. Increased polyamine metabolism of E-deficient rats suggests either a greater sensitivity to injury by O3 or a possible antioxidant function for polyamines compensating for E deficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elsayed", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-27309", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2FZ7Y3VOQX", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U87FK77H25", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V10TVZ52E4", "NameOfSubstance": "Putrescine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Putrescine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spermidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spermine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3592681", "10.1016/0003-9861(87)90407-3", "0003-9861(87)90407-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
