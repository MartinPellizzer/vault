Airway responsiveness to acetylcholine and the numbers of cells in lavage fluid were determined 1 wk before and then 1 h and 1 wk after 2-h exposures to filtered air and to ozone (3.0 ppm) in each of 5 dogs. Airway responsiveness and the numbers of cells in lavage fluid did not change after exposure to filtered air. By contrast, airway responsiveness increased markedly 1 h after exposure to ozone and returned to control levels 1 wk later. In addition, the numbers of neutrophils and of ciliated epithelial cells in lavage increased markedly 1 h after ozone and returned to control levels 1 wk later. Our previous study showed that airway hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone is associated with an influx of neutrophils into the most central airways (1); the present results suggest that the hyperresponsiveness is also accompanied by an influx of neutrophils into more distal airways and by desquamation of airway epithelial cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabbri", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aizawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alpert", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walters", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Byrne", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gold", "ForeName": "B D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nadel", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holtzman", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-00797", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-24136", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Constriction, Pathologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutic Irrigation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6696327"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
