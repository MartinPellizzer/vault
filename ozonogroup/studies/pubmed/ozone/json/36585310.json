The evidence from both human and animal studies supporting the cardiovascular impact of exposure to air pollution has grown substantially, implicating numerous pathophysiological pathways and related signalling mediators. In this review, we summarise the list of activated mediators for each pathway that lead to myocardial and vascular injury in response to air pollutants. We performed a systematic search of multiple databases, including articles between 1990 and Jan 2022, summarising the evidence for activated pathways in response to each significant air pollutant. Particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) was the most studied pollutant, followed by particulate matter between 2.5 \u03bcm-10 \u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Key pathogenic pathways that emerged included activation of systemic and local inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction. We looked at how potential mediators of each of these pathways were linked to both cardiovascular disease and air pollution and included the overlapping mediators. This review illustrates the complex relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular diseases, and discusses challenges in moving beyond associations, towards understanding causal contributions of specific pathways and markers that may inform us regarding an individual's exposure, response, and likely risk."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
