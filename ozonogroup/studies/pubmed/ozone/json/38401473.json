The effectiveness of ozonation in mitigating wastewater toxicity is minimal. Simultaneous application of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) (5 mg/L) and ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI)) (10 mg-Fe/L) reduced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity towards mammalian cells by 39.8% and 71.1% (pH 7.0), respectively, when the wastewater has low levels of Br<sup>-</sup>. This enhanced reduction in toxicity can be attributed to increased production of reactive iron species Fe(IV)/Fe(V) and reactive oxygen species (\u2022OH) that possess higher oxidizing ability. When wastewater contains 2 mg/L Br<sup>-</sup>, ozonation increased cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by 168%-180% and 150%-155%, respectively, primarily due to the formation of organic bromine. However, O<sub>3</sub>/Fe(VI) significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed both total organic bromine (TOBr), BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, as well as their associated toxicity. Electron donating capacity (EDC) measurement and precursor inference using Orbitrap ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry found that Fe(IV)/Fe(V) and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH enhanced EDC removal from precursors present in wastewater, inhibiting electrophilic substitution and electrophilic addition reactions that lead to organic bromine formation. Additionally, HOBr quenched by self-decomposition-produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from Fe(VI) also inhibits TOBr formation along with its associated toxicity. The adsorption of Fe(III) flocs resulting from Fe(VI) decomposition contributes only minimally to reducing toxicity. Compared to ozonation alone, integration of Fe(VI) with O<sub>3</sub> offers improved safety for treating wastewater with varying concentrations of Br<sup>-</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
