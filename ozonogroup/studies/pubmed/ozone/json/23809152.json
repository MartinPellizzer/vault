Uncontaminated group underwent upper median sternotomy. The remaining four groups were inoculated with 0.5 mL 10(8) colony-forming units/mL methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the mediastinal and sternal layers. Untreated contaminated group had no treatment. Rats in the vancomycin group received intramuscular vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d), and ozone was administered intraperitoneally (70 \u03bcg/mL, 1 mg/kg/d) in the ozone group for the treatment of mediastinitis. Vancomycin + ozone group rats were treated by the combination of both methods. At the end of 10 d, quantitative bacterial cultures and sternal tissue samples were obtained for determination of bacterial counts and histologic degree of inflammation.", "Both the vancomycin and the ozone treatments caused significant reduction of bacterial counts in quantitative bacterial cultures. Combination of vancomycin and ozone treatments resulted in further reduction of bacterial counts in mediastinum and sternum. Histologic examination of tissue samples revealed significant reduction in severity of mediastinitis related inflammation in vancomycin and vancomycin + ozone groups compared with untreated contaminated group.", "Ozone therapy as an adjunct to vancomycin leads to enhanced bacterial elimination in infected sternal and mediastinal tissues in experimental methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus mediastinitis.
