Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have significant impact on the formation of O<sub>3</sub> and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) contributing PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Herein, we investigated 54 VOCs, O<sub>3</sub> and SOA in Tianjin from June 2017 to May 2019 to explore the non-linear relationship among O<sub>3</sub>, SOA and VOCs. The monthly patterns of VOCs and SOA concentrations were characterized by peak values during October to March and reached a minimum from April to September, but the observed O<sub>3</sub> was exactly the opposite. Machine learning methods resolved the importance of individual VOCs on O<sub>3</sub> and SOA that alkenes (mainly ethylene, propylene, and isoprene) have the highest importance to O<sub>3</sub> formation; alkanes (C<sub>n</sub>, n \u2265 6) and aromatics were the main source of SOA formation. Machine learning methods revealed and emphasized the importance of photochemical consumptions of VOCs to O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation. Ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) calculated by consumed VOCs quantitatively indicated that more than 80% of the consumed VOCs were alkenes which dominated the O<sub>3</sub> formation, and the importance of consumed aromatics and alkenes to SOAFP were 40.84% and 56.65%, respectively. Therein, isoprene contributed the most to OFP at 41.45% regardless of the season, while aromatics (58.27%) contributed the most to SOAFP in winter. Collectively, our findings can provide scientific evidence on policymaking for VOCs controls on seasonal scales to achieve effective reduction in both SOA and O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
