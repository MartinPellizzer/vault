They were grown under different light conditions, because some of the chambers received approximately 10% less light than the others. Samples from three age classes were analyzed for nitrogen and pigments using HPLC. It could be demonstrated that the ozone treatment reduced the concentration of chlorophyll (a) and (b), alpha- and beta-carotene, but increased the concentration of antheraxanthin. A significant decrease was found for the violaxanthin/antheraxanthin ratio following the ozone treatment. The concentration of all the pigments and of nitrogen were significantly related to the age classes, and a similar relationship was found for the light levels, except for antheraxanthin and total carotenoids. The ratio of chlorophyll a/b was only significantly related to the age classes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Ecology, Botanical Institute, University of Copenhagen, \u00d8ster Farimagsgade 2D, 1353, Copenhagen K, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mikkelsen", "ForeName": "T N", "Initials": "TN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dodell", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fctz", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091594", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)p2607-b", "0269-7491(94)P2607-B"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
