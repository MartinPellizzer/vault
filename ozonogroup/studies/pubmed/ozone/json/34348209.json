The benzoquinone structural motive is associated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, and also with induction of the oxidative stress response through the Nrf2 pathway. For either endpoint, toxicological data for differently substituted compounds are scarce. In this study, oxidative stress response, as indicated by the AREc32 in vitro bioassay, was induced by differently substituted para-benzoquinones, but also by the corresponding hydroquinones. Bioassays that indicate defense against genotoxicity (p53RE-bla) and DNA repair activity (UmuC) were not activated by these compounds. Stability tests conducted under incubation conditions, but in the absence of cell lines, showed that tested para-benzoquinones reacted rapidly with constituents of the incubation medium. Compounds were abated already in phosphate buffer, but even faster in biological media, with reactions attributed to amino- and thiol-groups of peptides, proteins, and free amino acids. The products of these reactions were often the corresponding substituted hydroquinones. Conversely, differently substituted hydroquinones were quantitatively oxidized to p-benzoquinones over the course of the incubation. The observed induction of the oxidative stress response was attributed to hydroquinones that are presumably oxidized to benzoquinones inside the cells. Despite the instability of the tested compounds in the incubation medium, the AREc32 in vitro bioassay could be used as an unspecific sum parameter to detect para-benzoquinones and hydroquinones in oxidatively treated waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
