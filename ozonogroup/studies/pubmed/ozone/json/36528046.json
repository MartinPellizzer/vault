Also, it is worthwhile to recycle porous spent fluid catalytic cracking (SFCC) catalysts from various petroleum refineries in terms of reducing industrial waste and the reuse of discharged resources. Therefore, Mn and Mn-Cu added SFCC (Mn/SFCC and Mn-Cu/SFCC) catalysts were prepared to compare their catalytic efficiencies together with the SFCC catalyst in the ozonation of 2-butanone. Since the SFCC-based catalysts have a structure similar to that of zeolite Y (Y), the Mn-loaded zeolite Y catalyst (Mn/Y) was also prepared to compare its activity for the removal of 2-butanone and ozone to that of the SFCC-based ones at room temperature. Among the five catalysts of this study (Y, Mn/Y, SFCC, Mn/SFCC, and Mn-Cu/SFCC), the Mn-Cu/SFCC and Mn/SFCC catalysts showed the better catalytic decomposition activity than the others. The increased distributions of the Mn<sup>3+</sup> species and the O<sub>vacancy</sub> sites in Mn/SFCC and Mn-Cu/SFCC catalysts which could supply more available active sites for the 2-butanone and ozone removal would enhance the catalytic activity of them."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
