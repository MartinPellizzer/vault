For decades, incineration was the method of choice for the treatment of such infectious wastes. Incinerator releases a wide variety of pollutants depending on the composition of the waste, which leads to health deterioration and environmental degradation. The significant pollutants emitted are particulate matter, metals, acid gases, oxides of nitrogen, and sulfur, aside from the release of innumerable substances of unknown toxicity. This process of waste incineration poses a significant threat to public health and the environment. The major impact on health is the higher incidence of cancer and respiratory symptoms; other potential effects are congenital abnormalities, hormonal defects, and increase in sex ratio. The effect on the environmental is in the form of global warming, acidification, photochemical ozone or smog formation, eutrophication, and human and animal toxicity. Thus, there is a need to skip to newer, widely accepted, economical, and environment-friendly technologies. The use of hydroclaves and plasma pyrolysis for the incineration of biomedical wastes leads to lesser environmental degradation, negligible health impacts, safe handling of treated wastes, lesser running and maintenance costs, more effective reduction of microorganisms, and safer disposal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India. drramansharmamha@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Raman", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Meenakshi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ratika", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Vivek", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Rev Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0425754", "ISSNLinking": "0048-7554"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroid Hormones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abnormalities, Drug-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Incineration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23612530", "10.1515/reveh-2012-0035", "/j/reveh.2013.28.issue-1/reveh-2012-0035/reveh-2012-0035.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
