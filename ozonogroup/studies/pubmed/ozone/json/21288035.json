Platinum colloid nanoparticles with four types of capping layers have been synthesized and used as model lubricant systems: TTAB (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide), HDA (hexadecylamine), HDT (hexadecylthiol), and PVP (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)). Two-dimensional arrays of colloid nanoparticles were prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett method. We found that the friction and adhesion properties on colloid nanoparticles are lower than those on a silicon surface. The variation of friction when changing the capping layers is \u223c30%, and it appears that the friction depends on the packing and ordering of the capping layers. Partial removal of the capping layers using ultraviolet light (UV)-ozone surface treatment resulted in increased friction. These results suggest a new method of tuning nanometer scale friction and adhesion by engineering organic capping layers on nanoparticles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of EEWS (WCU) and NanoCentury KI, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) , Daejeon, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jeong Young", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21288035", "10.1021/la104353f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
