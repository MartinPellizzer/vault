The degradation and mineralization of clofibric acid (CA) in CF/O<sub>3</sub> process were dramatically enhanced in comparison with those under the O<sub>3</sub> system. Surface hydroxyl groups (HGs) were considered as an important factor for ozone decomposition and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the catalyst surface were mainly responsible for CA elimination. The contribution and formation of ROS, including hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH), especially superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>), singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were evaluated, and a rational mechanism was elucidated accordingly. Probable degradation pathway of CA was proposed according to the organic intermediates identified. The acute toxicity of the treated solution increased during the first 15\u00a0min and then declined rapidly and nearly disappeared as the reaction proceeded. In addition, acceptable catalytic performance of CF/O<sub>3</sub> can be obtained for the treatment of other EOCs and the treatment of natural surface water spiked with CA. This work presents an efficient and promising catalytic ozonation technique for the elimination of EOCs in complex water matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
