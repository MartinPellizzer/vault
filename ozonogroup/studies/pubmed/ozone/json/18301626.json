For its long-term radiometric and spectral calibration the GOME observes the sun and less frequently the moon on a regular basis. These measurements of the lunar radiance and solar irradiance have been used in a study to determine, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, the geometric lunar albedo from 240 to 800 nm at high spectral resolution from space. For a waning moon there is good agreement with ground-based measurements in the visible region and with recent space-based measurements in the ultraviolet region. In addition, the use of these measurements for the characterization of in-orbit degradation of instruments operating in this spectral region has been adequately demonstrated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobber", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goede", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burrows", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18301626", "10.1364/ao.37.007832", "60628"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
