Sour rot incidence of wounded berries, inoculated with 8 NSYstrains, or 7 AAB, or 56 yeast-bacterium associations, was monitored at 25\u00a0\u00b0C up to six days. Sour rot incidence in wounded berries inoculated with yeast-bacterium associations resulted higher than in berries inoculated with one single NSY or AAB strain. Among all NSY-AAB associations, the yeast-bacterium association composed of Candida zemplinina CBS 9494 (Cz) and Acetobacter syzygii LMG 21419 (As) showed the highest prevalence of sour rot; thus, after preliminary in\u00a0vitro assays, this simplified As-Cz microbial consortium was inoculated in wounded berries that were stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for ten days under ozone (2.14\u00a0mg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) or in air. At the end of cold storage, no berries showed sour-rot symptoms although ozonation mainly affected As viable cell count. After additional 12 days at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, the sour rot index of inoculated As-Cz berries previously cold-stored under ozone or in air accounted for 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7% and 66.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5%, respectively. Molecular analyses of dominant AAB and NSY populations of both sound and rotten berries during post-refrigeration period revealed the appearance of new strains mainly belonging to Gluconobacter albidus and Hanseniaspora uvarum species, respectively. Cold ozonation resulted an effective approach to extend the shelf-life of table grapes also after cold storage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
