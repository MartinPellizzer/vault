However, no previous study has examined how MetS affects markers of NO formation, and whether exercise training increases NO formation in MetS patients. Here, we tested these two hypotheses. We studied 48 sedentary individuals: 20 healthy controls and 28 MetS patients. Eighteen MetS patients were subjected to a 3-month exercise training (E+group), while the remaining 10 MetS patients remained sedentary (E-group). The plasma concentrations of nitrite, cGMP, and ADMA (asymmetrical dimethylarginine; an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), and the whole blood nitrite concentrations were determined at baseline and after exercise training using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay, and commercial enzyme immunoassays. Thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBA-RS) were measured in the plasma to assess oxidative stress using a fluorometric method. We found that, compared with healthy subjects, patients with MetS have lower concentrations of markers of NO formation, including whole blood nitrite, plasma nitrite, and plasma cGMP, and increased oxidative stress (all P<0.05). Exercise training increased the concentrations of whole blood nitrite and cGMP, and decreased both oxidative stress and the circulating concentrations of ADMA (both P<0.05). These findings show clinical evidence for lower endogenous NO formation in patients with MetS, and for improvements in NO formation associated with exercise training in MetS patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, 13081-970 Campinas, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomes", "ForeName": "Val\u00e9ria A", "Initials": "VA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Casella-Filho", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chagas", "ForeName": "Antonio C P", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanus-Santos", "ForeName": "Jose E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nitric Oxide", "NlmUniqueID": "9709307", "ISSNLinking": "1089-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethylarginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94ZLA3W45F", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H2D2X058MU", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic GMP"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Arginine"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic GMP"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18799138", "10.1016/j.niox.2008.08.005", "S1089-8603(08)00365-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
