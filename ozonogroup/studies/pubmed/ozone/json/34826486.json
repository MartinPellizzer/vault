Although CS07A predicts slightly lower O<sub>3</sub> concentrations than the standard fix-parameter version of the SAPRC-11 mechanism, the two mechanisms predict almost identical relative responses to daily maximum 8-hour O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) due to NO<sub>x</sub> and VOC emission reductions. A source-oriented version of the CS07A is applied to determine source contributions of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs to O<sub>3</sub> using MEIC and REAS. The two inventories lead to similar model performance of O<sub>3</sub>, with MEIC predicting higher O<sub>3</sub> in Beijing and Shanghai, especially on high O<sub>3</sub> days. Source apportionment results show that industry and transportation are the top two contributors to non-background O<sub>3</sub> for both inventories, followed by power and biogenic emissions. In general, the two inventories lead to similar source contribution estimations to O<sub>3</sub> attributable to NO<sub>x</sub>. However, their estimations of relative contributions to VOC-related O<sub>3</sub> differ for the industrial and transportation sectors. Differences in the source apportionment results are more significant in some urban areas, although both emissions capture the spatial variations in the source contributions. Our results suggest that future emission control policies should be assessed using multiple emission inventories, and the condensed CS07A is suitable for policy applications when a large number of simulations are needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
