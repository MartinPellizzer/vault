Kingzett's \"Sanitas\" products enjoyed great popularity, and their properties were ascribed to fixed ozone, although the researches of Kingzett and others showed that the key components were hydroperoxides that may have given rise to hydrogen peroxide in solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Melbourne, Australia. idrae@unimelb.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rae", "ForeName": "Ian D", "Initials": "ID"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ambix", "NlmUniqueID": "14730560R", "ISSNLinking": "0002-6980"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17153724", "10.1179/174582306X93192"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
