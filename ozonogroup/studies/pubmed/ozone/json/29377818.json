In dry periods, up to 70% of the receiving water consists of treated wastewater. Thus, it is expected that effects of ozonation on downstream water biocoenosis will become observable. Extensive monitoring of receiving water and the WWTP shows a severe pollution with micropollutants (already prior to WWTP inlet). (Eco-)Toxicological investigations showed increased toxicity at the inlet of the WWTP for all assays. However, endocrine-disrupting potential was also present at other sampling points at the WWTP and in the river and could not be eliminated sufficiently by the WWTP. Total cell counts at the WWTP are slightly below average. Investigations of antibiotic resistances show no increase after the WWTP outlet in the river. However, cells carrying antibiotic-resistant genes seem to be more stress resistant in general. Comparing investigations after implementation of ozonation should lead to an approximation of the correlation between micropollutants and water quality/biocoenosis and the effects that ozonation has on this matter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waterboard Eifel-Rur, Eisenbahnstr. 5, Dueren 52353, Germany E-mail: ira.brueckner@wver.de."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Br\u00fcckner", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Microbiology, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirchner", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Research, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Research, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schiwy", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Mies-van-der-Rohe-Str. 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klaer", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Mies-van-der-Rohe-Str. 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dolny", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Microbiology, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wendt", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Research, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00f6nemann", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Mies-van-der-Rohe-Str. 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinnekamp", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Research, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, Aachen 52074, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hollert", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans-Kn\u00f6ll-Institute, Adolf-Reichwein-Str. 23, Jena 07745, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenbaum", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29377818", "10.2166/wst.2017.548"]}}]}
