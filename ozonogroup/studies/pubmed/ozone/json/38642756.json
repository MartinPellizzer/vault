When microplastics pass through water treatment plants, they can be oxidized, changing their surface characteristics and the quality of the treated water. This work aimed to investigate the impact of ozone and the association of ozone and hydrogen peroxide on five different microplastic particles that are commonly detected in water samples. The changes in the concentration of total organic carbon and the change in the pH of the water, the leaching of phthalic acid esters, as well as the changes in size and chemical changes in the structure of the tested microplastics were evaluated. The influence of ozonation time, water pH, and type of microplastics, as well as the influence of the addition of hydrogen peroxide, was analyzed. The effect of ozonation was an increase in DOC values ranging from 0.8 to 28\u00a0mg/L. The eluting substances included phthalic acid esters, plasticizers with a proven negative impact on organisms. The percentage loss of the surface area of the microplastic was in the range of 1.3 to 26.7\u00a0%. PE was more susceptible to degradation. LDIR analyzes were carried out to investigate the effect of O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments on the surface of MPs. This study demonstrated that MPs could change their physical and chemical characteristics if they are subjected to oxidation processes used in water treatment plants. The parameters of purified water change to unfavorable ones due to the leaching of additives. Although much research has been conducted on the occurrence of microplastics in treated water, awareness needs to be raised about the interactions between plastic particles and water treatment technology processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
