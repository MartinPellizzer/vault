The content of humic substances after the coagulation treatment decreases up to 70%. Then leachate obtained from a solid with initial COD=1511 mg/L and the pH 8.5 was treated by ozone. The aqueous samples by a UV-vis and HPLC technique were analyzed. The partial identification of the initial composition of the organic matter as well as of intermediates and final products was carried out after the extraction of the initial and ozonated leachate with benzene, chloroform:methanol (2:1) and hexane. Then the extracts with a gas chromatograph with mass detector and FID were analyzed. In the HPLC results we identify malonic and oxalic acids. The initial concentrations of these acids were 19 mg/L and 214 mg/L, respectively. The oxalic acid is formatted and accumulated in ozonation. The obtained results show that the color disappears (visually) at 100% during 5 min of ozonation. The organic substances, extracted with chloroform-methanol, may be destructed during 15 min of ozonation; the organic matter, extracted with benzene, destructs completely by ozone during 5 min, and the organic compounds extracted with hexane have a low ozonation rate. The toxic compounds presented in leachate decompose completely during 15 min of ozonation. The ozonation rate constants for each group of organics (as observed constants) were calculated applying simplified mathematical model and the recurrent least square method using the program MATLAB 6.5."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Superior School of Chemical Engineering, National Polytechnic Institute (ESIQIE-IPN), Edif. 7, UPALM, C.P. 07738, Mexico, DF, Mexico. tpoznyak@ipn.mx <tpoznyak@ipn.mx>"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poznyak", "ForeName": "Tatyana", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bautista", "ForeName": "G Luis", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cha\u00edrez", "ForeName": "Isaac", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "C\u00f3rdova", "ForeName": "R Ivan", "Initials": "RI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "R\u00edos", "ForeName": "L Elvira", "Initials": "LE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17868984", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.07.098", "S0304-3894(07)01117-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
