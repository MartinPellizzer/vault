These species are expected to undergo rapid photochemical processing, affecting atmospheric composition. In this study, the photochemistry of (E)-2-butenedial and both E and Z isomers of 4-oxo-2-pentenal was investigated under natural sunlight conditions at the large outdoor atmospheric simulation chamber EUPHORE. Photochemical loss rates, relative to j(NO<sub>2</sub>), are determined to be j((E)-2-butenedial)/j(NO<sub>2</sub>) = 0.14 (\u00b10.02), j((E)-4-oxo-2-pentenal)/j(NO<sub>2</sub>) = 0.18 (\u00b10.01), and j((Z)-4-oxo-2-pentenal)/j(NO<sub>2</sub>) = 0.20 (\u00b10.03). The major products detected for both species are a furanone (30-42%) and, for (E)-2-butenedial, maleic anhydride (2,5-furandione) (12-14%). The mechanism appears to proceed predominantly via photoisomerization to a ketene-enol species following \u03b3-H abstraction. The lifetimes of the ketene-enol species in the dark from 2-butenedial and 4-oxo-2-pentenal are determined to be 465 s and 235 s, respectively. The ketene-enol can undergo ring closure to yield the corresponding furanone, or further unimolecular rearrangement which can subsequently form maleic anhydride. A minor channel (10-15%) also appears to form CO directly. This is presumed to be via a molecular elimination route of an initial biradical intermediate formed in photolysis, with an unsaturated carbonyl (detected here but not quantified) as co-product. \u03b1-Dicarbonyl and radical yields are very low, which has implications for ozone production from the photo-oxidation of unsaturated 1,4-dicarbonyls in the boundary layer. Photochemical removal is determined to be the major loss process for these species in the boundary layer with lifetimes of the order of 10-15 minutes, compared to >3 hours for reaction with OH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University of York, UK. mike.newland@york.ac.uk."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newland", "ForeName": "Mike J", "Initials": "MJ", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rea", "ForeName": "Gerard J", "Initials": "GJ", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Th\u00fcner", "ForeName": "Lars P", "Initials": "LP", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "Alistair P", "Initials": "AP", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Golding", "ForeName": "Bernard T", "Initials": "BT", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rickard", "ForeName": "Andrew R", "Initials": "AR", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wenger", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30620029", "10.1039/c8cp06437g"]}}]}
