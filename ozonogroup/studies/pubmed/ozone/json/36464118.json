Understanding the key drivers behind the O<sub>3</sub> formation and developing an accurate and efficient method for timely assessing the O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NOx relationships applicable in different O<sub>3</sub> pollution events are essential. Here, we developed a novel machine learning ensemble model coupled with a Shapley additive explanation algorithm to predict the O<sub>3</sub> formation regime and derive O<sub>3</sub> formation sensitivity curves. The algorithm was tested for O<sub>3</sub> events during the COVID-19 lockdown, a sandstorm event, and a heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode (maximum hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration >200\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) from 2019 to 2021. We show that increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during the COVID-19 lockdown and the heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution event were mainly caused by the photochemistry subject to local air quality and meteorological conditions. Influenced by the sandstorm weather, low O<sub>3</sub> levels were mainly attributable to weak sunlight and low precursor levels. O<sub>3</sub> formation sensitivity curves demonstrate that O<sub>3</sub> formation in the study area was in a VOCs-sensitive regime. The VOCs-specific O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity curves can also help make hybrid and timely strategies for O<sub>3</sub> abatement. The results demonstrate that machine learning driven by observational data has the potential to be a very useful tool in predicting and interpreting O<sub>3</sub> formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
