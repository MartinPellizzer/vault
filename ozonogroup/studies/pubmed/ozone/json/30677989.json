We investigated the trends of meteorological variables and O<sub>3</sub> and how these environmental conditions associate with tree health from 2001 onward. Ozone metrics for forest protection, based on Accumulated O<sub>3</sub> exposure Over a Threshold of X ppb (AOTX) or on Phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> Dose over a Y threshold (PODY), were modeled at nine ICP-Forests plots over the time period 2001-2014. Tree-response indicators, i.e. crown defoliation and visible foliar O<sub>3</sub> injury, were assessed during annual field surveys carried out at each ICP-Forests plot over the time period 2007-2017. Mann-Kendall and Sen statistical tests were applied to estimate changes over time of meteorological variables, response indicators and O<sub>3</sub> metrics. Finally, the O<sub>3</sub> metrics were correlated (Spearman test) to the response indicators over the common period 2007-2014. Over this time period, trend analyses revealed an increasingly hotter (+0.27\u202f\u00b0C\u202fdecade<sup>-1</sup>, on average) and drier climate (rainfall, -48\u202fmm\u202fdecade<sup>-1</sup>). A reduction was found for O<sub>3</sub> annual mean (-0.28\u202fppb\u202fdecade<sup>-1</sup>, on average) and AOT40 (-2540\u202fppb\u00b7h\u202fdecade<sup>-1</sup>, on average) whereas an increase was found for POD0 (+0.40\u202fmmol\u202fm<sup>-2</sup>\u202fdecade<sup>-1</sup>, on average). Visible foliar O<sub>3</sub> injury increased (+0.17%\u202fdecade<sup>-1</sup>), while an improvement of the crown conditions (-5.0%\u202fdecade<sup>-1</sup>) was observed. AOT40 was significantly associated with crown defoliation while PODY and soil water content were correlated with visible foliar O<sub>3</sub> injury. As visible foliar O<sub>3</sub> injury was negligible in all the studied species, the results suggest that moderate O<sub>3</sub> pollution (approximately 30\u202fppb as annual average) does not induce biologically significant effects on this forest vegetation under the current conditions, however the overall O<sub>3</sub> risk (POD0) is expected to increase in the future under a hotter and drier climate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
