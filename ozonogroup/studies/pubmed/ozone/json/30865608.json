This paper focuses on the oxidation process of chromium (III) with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in an alkaline medium. The effect of parameters including dosage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, dosage of NaOH, reaction time, reaction temperature and stirring rate on the oxidation efficiency of chromium were investigated. The oxidation efficiency was significantly affected by the dosage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NaOH, reaction time and reaction temperature took second place; last was the stirring rate. Oxidation efficiency was nearly 100% under the optimal conditions: volume ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to mass of Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> of 2.4 mL/g, mass ratio of NaOH to Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> 0.6 g/g, reaction time of 90 min, reaction temperature of 90 \u00b0C and stirring rate of 500 rpm."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing 408102, China E-mail: cqupenghao@cqu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing 408102, China E-mail: cqupenghao@cqu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing 408102, China E-mail: cqupenghao@cqu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing 408102, China E-mail: cqupenghao@cqu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Qinzhe", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing 408102, China E-mail: cqupenghao@cqu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yuju", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zuohua", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Changyuan", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30865608", "10.2166/wst.2019.056"]}}]}
