The results showed that the removal efficiency of BPS by O<sub>3</sub> could be significantly improved with addition of PMS. Compared with ozonation alone, the pseudo-first-order constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) was increased by 2-5 times after adding 400\u00a0\u03bcM PMS. In O<sub>3</sub>/PMS system, accelerated removal of BPS was observed under neutral and alkaline conditions. The removal efficiency of BPS reached 100% after 40\u00a0s of reaction at pH 7.0, with the k<sub>obs</sub> of 0.098 s<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, Cu<sup>2+</sup> had a catalytic effect on the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS system, because it could catalyze the decomposition of ozone and PMS to produce \u2022OH and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>, respectively. Electron paramagnetic resonance illustrated that \u2022OH and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> were the reactive species in O<sub>3</sub>/PMS system. Twelve intermediates were identified by mass spectrometry, and the degradation reactions in O<sub>3</sub>/PMS system mainly included hydroxylation, sulfate addition, polymerization and \u03b2-scission. Finally, the toxicity of the products was evaluated by the EOCSAR program. Our results introduce an efficient method for BPS removal and would provide some guidance for the development of O<sub>3</sub>-based advanced oxidation technology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
