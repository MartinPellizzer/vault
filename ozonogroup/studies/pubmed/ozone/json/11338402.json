The range of percentages for UVery was up to double that of the percentages of the visible waveband. The percentages for UVery were also higher than for the UVA waveband. The percentages of the irradiances in the tree shade compared to full sun are 8-14% lower at noon compared to the morning and afternoon for the UVery waveband. The ratio of UVA to UVery is lower in the tree shade compared to the full sun.", "The UVA to UVery ratio is expected to be even lower in the tree shade as a result of ozone depletion. This, combined with the visible irradiances in the tree shade not being a reliable indication of the biologically damaging UV irradiances, has consequences for public health and skin cancer prevention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Astronomy and Atmospheric Research, Faculty of Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parisi", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kimlin", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turnbull", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lester", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed", "NlmUniqueID": "9013641", "ISSNLinking": "0905-4383"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11338402", "10.1034/j.1600-0781.2001.017002055.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
