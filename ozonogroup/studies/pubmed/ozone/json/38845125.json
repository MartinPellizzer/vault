In this study, a nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) was modified via intercalation with octanoate to develop an effective hydrophobic catalyst (NiFe-OAa-LDH) for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition. The NiFe-OAa-LDH catalyst sustained its O<sub>3</sub> decomposition rate of >98% for 48 h under conditions of 90% relative humidity, 840 L/(g\u00b7h) space velocity, and 100 ppm inlet O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Moreover, it maintained a decomposition rate of 90% even when tested at a higher airflow rate of 2500 L/(g\u00b7h). Based on the changes induced by the Ni-O<sup>II</sup> to Ni-O<sup>III</sup> bonds in NiFe-OAa-LDH during O<sub>3</sub> treatment, catalytic O<sub>3</sub> decomposition was proposed to occur in two stages. The first stage involved the reaction between the hydroxyl groups and O<sub>3</sub>, leading to the breakage of the O-H bonds, formation of NiOOH, and structural changes in the catalyst. This transformation resulted in the formation of abundant and stable hydrogen vacancies. According to density functional theory calculations, O<sub>3</sub> can be effectively decomposed at the hydrogen vacancies with a low energy barrier during the second stage. This study provides new insights into O<sub>3</sub> decomposition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiaqi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8839-7924"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yixing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Fengyu", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Ziruo", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Hengxi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunxue", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7099-1098"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Langlang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9202-2191"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xueqian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1302-6202"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Ning", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4364-9956"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38845125", "10.1021/acs.est.4c01312"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
