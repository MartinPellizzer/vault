However, the photolysis mechanism of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and its products under different atmospheric conditions remain unclear. In this study, the effects of relative humidity (RH), pH, NH<sub>3</sub>, ultraviolet (UV) light intensity and halogen ions (Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup> and I<sup>-</sup>) on the photolysis of particulate NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> have been investigated through a flow tube reactor. The results show that RH can significantly enhance the production of gaseous NO<sub>2</sub> from the photolysis of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> when RH is higher than its deliquescence RH, but almost no NO<sub>2</sub> is generated under dry conditions. Under high RH and UV light, the main product of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> photolysis is NO<sub>2</sub>, rather than NO and HONO, and another main species HNO<sub>3</sub> which mainly comes from the hydrolysis of product NO<sub>2</sub> in the gas path was detected. Almost no NO<sub>2</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub> are produced under high RH without UV light or low RH with UV light, showing the combined effect of high RH and UV irradiation on the photolysis of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. In addition, under high RH, the lower the pH and the stronger the light intensity, the higher the NO<sub>2</sub> production. Furthermore, surprising yields of NO and HONO are detected in the presence of halogen ions, especially in the presence of I<sup>-</sup>, indicating the important role of halogen ion in the nitrate photolysis. These results provide new insights into the photolysis of atmospheric nitrate aerosols, and may contribute to elucidating the formation and migration of atmospheric nitrate aerosols and the potential mechanisms of the occurrence and evolution of atmospheric pollution and ozone pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
