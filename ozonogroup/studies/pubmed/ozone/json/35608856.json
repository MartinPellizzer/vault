Atmospheric aqueous-phase chemistry has been considered to be a source of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and OH. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of their formation in atmospheric waters is still incomplete. Here, we show that the aqueous-phase reaction of dissolved ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) with substituted phenols such as <i>m</i>-cresol represents an important source of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and OH exhibiting pH-dependent yields. Intriguingly, the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through the ring-opening mechanism is strongly promoted under lower pH conditions (pH 2.5-3.5), while higher pH favors the ring-retaining pathways yielding OH. The rate constant of the reaction of O<sub>3</sub> with <i>m</i>-cresol increases with increasing pH. The reaction products formed during the ozonolysis of <i>m</i>-cresol are analyzed by an Orbitrap mass spectrometer, and reaction pathways are suggested based on the identified product compounds. This study indicates that aqueous-phase ozonolysis of phenolic compounds might be an alternative source of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and OH in the cloud, rain, and liquid water of aerosol particles; thus, it should be considered in future model studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry and
