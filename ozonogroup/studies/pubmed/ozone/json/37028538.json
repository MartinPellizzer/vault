Personal exposure concentrations of fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), inhalable particles (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) for mothers were estimated based on their residential address during pregnancy using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method. We used the logistic regression models to determine the associations at different stages of pregnancy with adjustment for confounding factors.", "There were 3218 stillbirths and 505,839 live births among the participants. For each 100\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> of CO and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> of O<sub>3</sub> increase in the first trimester (conception to 13<sup>+6</sup> weeks), the risk of stillbirth increased by 1.0% (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.01, 95%CI: 1.00-1.03) and 7.0% (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.07, 95%CI: 1.05-1.09). In the second trimester (14 weeks-27<sup>+6</sup> weeks), PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub> exposure were closely related to the risk of stillbirth (P\uff1c0.05). In the third trimester (28 weeks to delivery), for each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in exposure concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>, the risk of stillbirth increased by 3.4%, 5.9%, and 4.0%, respectively. O<sub>3</sub> exposure was positively relevant to the risk of stillbirth (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.11, 95%CI: 1.08-1.14) in the whole pregnancy. Exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> was not significantly associated with the risk of stillbirth. Stratified analyses also presented a stronger association among mothers with boy infant, living in rural areas, delivering between 2011 and 2013, and those without gestational hypertension and history of stillbirth.", "This study provides evidence that maternal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub> were related to the increased risk of stillbirth. Both the second and third trimesters might be vital susceptible windows for stillbirth.
