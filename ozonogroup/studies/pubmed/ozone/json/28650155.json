The analysis was performed on few layer (5-10) MoS<sub>2</sub> MOSFETs fabricated using photolithographic patterning with 13 and 8 nm HfO<sub>2</sub> gate oxide layers formed by atomic layer deposition after in-situ UV-O<sub>3</sub> surface functionalization. The impedance response of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> gate stack indicates the existence of specific defects at the interface, which exhibited either a frequency-dependent distortion similar to conventional Si MOSFETs with unpassivated silicon dangling bonds or a frequency dispersion over the entire voltage range corresponding to depletion of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> surface, consistent with interface traps distributed over a range of energy levels. The interface defects density (D<sub>it</sub>) was extracted from the C-V responses by the high-low frequency and the multiple-frequency extraction methods, where a D<sub>it</sub> peak value of 1.2 \u00d7 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> eV<sup>-1</sup> was extracted for a device (7-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> and 13 nm HfO<sub>2</sub>) exhibiting a behavior approximating to a single trap response. The MoS<sub>2</sub> MOSFET with 4-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> and 8 nm HfO<sub>2</sub> gave D<sub>it</sub> values ranging from 2 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> to 2 \u00d7 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> eV<sup>-1</sup> across the energy range corresponding to depletion near the HfO<sub>2</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> interface. The gate current was below 10<sup>-7</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup> across the full bias sweep for both samples indicating continuous HfO<sub>2</sub> films resulting from the combined UV ozone and HfO<sub>2</sub> deposition process. The results demonstrated that impedance spectroscopy applied to relatively simple top-gated transistor test structures provides an approach to investigate electrically active defects at the HfO<sub>2</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> interface and should be applicable to alternative TMD materials, surface treatments, and gate oxides as an interface defect metrology tool in the development of TMD-based MOSFETs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas , 800 W Campbell Rd., Richardson, Texas 75080, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas , 800 W Campbell Rd., Richardson, Texas 75080, United States."}], "LastName": "Azcatl", "ForeName": "Angelica", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tyndall National Institute, Department of Chemistry, University of College Cork , Lee Maltings, Dyke Parade, Cork, Ireland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "V.
