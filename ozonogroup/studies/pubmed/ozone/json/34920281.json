This setup combines an O<sub>3</sub>-bubble column reactor with a carrier-bound TiO<sub>2</sub>/UV-system. The degradation of various chlorinated ethene and methane derivatives commonly found of chlorinated volatile organic compound polluted regional groundwater samples was investigated. Because of known issues within water remediation using AOP such as toxification by transformation products, this study aimed at complete mineralization of the contained organic micropollutants. Moreover, the influences of variable process parameters such as flow rate, ozone concentration, and radiation dose on process performance were statistically evaluated and discussed. Parameter optimization using a Box-Behnken experimental design resulted in very promising degradation rates. It was thus possible to achieve a degradation rate of at least 98% for cis-dichloroethene, trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene and 85% for trichloromethane without formation of transformation products. The results of this work open up the possibility of developing innovative technologies based on AOP, which can be universally applied even to challenging matrices such as groundwater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
