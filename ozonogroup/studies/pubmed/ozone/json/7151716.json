The influence of culture medium components and culture dish composition on the toxicity of ozone were also investigated. Cell viability, used to measure ozone toxicity, was quantified by the chromium-51 release assay, and by a viability index calculated from the percentage of cells stained with a vital dye combined with the decrease in cell number as determined by DNA measurements. During stationary ozone exposure, toxicity appeared to be mediated primarily by hydrogen peroxide and could be inhibited by catalase or fetal bovine serum when measured by the viability index. During rotated exposure, catalase and fetal bovine serum provided no protection when measured by the viability index, however, when measured by the chromium-51 release assay, fetal bovine serum was partially protective. The effect of ozone on the fibroblasts was not influenced by whether culture dishes were glass or plastic, or whether the culture medium was balanced salt solution or complete chemically-defined medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wenzel", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ESO 1315", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromium Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7151716", "10.3109/01480548209041053"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
