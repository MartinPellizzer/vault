We conducted a literature search in the PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Web of Science for articles that evaluated the combination effect of air pollution exposure and exercise on health. Questionnaires regarding exposure history, or studies examining indoor air pollution were excluded. Each included study needs to have clear exercise intervention plan. The pooled estimates of the combination effect of air pollution exposure and outdoor exercise on health were calculated in the meta-analysis. The quality of each included study was assessed and the quality of evidence for each outcome assessed in the meta-analysis was also measured. Twenty-five studies were identified. Six studies addressed ozone exposure, four diesel exhaust exposure, six traffic-related air pollution, ten particulate matter (PM) exposure. Only peak expiratory flow (effect size [ES]\u202f=\u202f-0.238, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u202f=\u202f-0.389, -0.088) was found to be significantly decreased after exercise intervention in a polluted environment in the meta-analysis. Seven studies reported exposure to air pollutant during exercise was associated with an increased risk of airway inflammation and decrements in pulmonary function. Six studies discovered that exposure of traffic pollution or high PM during exercise may contribute to changes in blood pressure, systemic conduit artery function and micro-vascular function. The combination effect of air pollution and exercise was found to be associated with the increased risk of potential health problems of cardiopulmonary function, immune function, and exercise performance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
