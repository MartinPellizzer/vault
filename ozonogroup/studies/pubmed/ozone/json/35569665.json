During the campaign, the daily maximum 8-hour average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and total VOC (TVOC) concentrations reached 72.2 \u00b1 19.9 ppb, 24.9 \u00b1 10.8 ppb, and 50.8 \u00b1 46.1 ppb, respectively. Alkanes, alkenes, halocarbons, aromatics, and alkynes contributed 45.3%, 24.0%, 16.5%, 10.0%, and 4.2% to TVOCs, respectively. The OH reactivity and relative incremental reactivity (RIR) of VOCs at different times were calculated. The results indicated that alkenes played a predominant role, accounting for an average of 68.5% of the initial VOC reactivity. Compared to other regions, alkenes are relatively more important for O<sub>3</sub> formation in the petrochemical industry area of Lanzhou, while aromatics are relatively less important. Generally, O<sub>3</sub> formation occurred in a VOC-limited regime in the morning and in a transitional regime in the afternoon. The response surface methodology (RSM) combined with a chemical box model was applied to obtain relationships between O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors and determine the most effective way to reduce the O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Reduction in the non-alkene concentration slightly affected the O<sub>3</sub> concentration. In contrast, the effect of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) was closely related to the alkene concentration, and NO<sub>x</sub> concentration reduction could lead to an increase in the O<sub>3</sub> concentration when alkenes were abated to less than 80% of the present concentration. To mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution near the petrochemical industrial area of Lanzhou, reducing the alkene concentration, especially the C4 alkene concentration (1,3-butadiene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene), was the fastest and most effective control strategy. The results of this study serve as a reference for O<sub>3</sub> pollution control in petrochemical industrial areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
