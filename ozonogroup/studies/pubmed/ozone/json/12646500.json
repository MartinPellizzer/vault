Measurements were made at the end of the second fumigation period in an open-top-chamber experiment with 9-year-old trees. Shoot ramification (number of long and short daughter shoots), shoot length, and number of metamers, leaves and buds were measured at four positions in every tree. As a result of increased temperature, trees in chambers had longer shoots and more frequent shoot ramification than control trees not enclosed in chambers. Ozone treatment decreased shoot ramification significantly. Additionally, ozone treatment resulted in an increased number of metamers in one clone. There was no statistically significant interaction between ozone effect and crown position; however, there was a slight tendency for the lower crown to be more affected by ozone. Elevated CO(2) caused a significant increase in the number of long-shoot metamers. Therefore, 2x ambient CO(2) concentration partly ameliorated the negative effect of ozone because the increased number of leaves per shoot counteracted the decreased branching. Although the main effects of elevated ozone and CO(2) were similar in the two clones, slight, statistically insignificant, differences appeared in their responses when interactions with crown position were considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany and Ecology, University of Tartu, Lai 40, 51005 Tartu, Estonia. olevi@ut.ee"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kull", "ForeName": "Olevi", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tulva", "ForeName": "Ingmar", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vapaavuori", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0372347", "ISSNLinking": "0305-7364"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "AckerlyDD, Bazzaz FA.1995.
