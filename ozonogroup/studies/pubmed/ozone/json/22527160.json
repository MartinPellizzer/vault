Although many countries have reduced methyl bromide use because of its ozone depleting properties, some uses remain in the United States and other countries, warranting further investigation of human health effects.", "We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between methyl bromide use and all cancers combined, as well as 12 specific sites, among 53,588 Agricultural Health Study pesticide applicators with follow-up from 1993 to 2007. We also evaluated interactions with a family history for four common cancers (prostate, lung, colon, and lymphohematopoietic). We categorized methyl bromide exposure based on lifetime days applied weighted by an intensity score.", "A total of 7,814 applicators (14.6\u00a0%) used methyl bromide, predominantly before enrollment. Based on 15 exposed cases, stomach cancer risk increased monotonically with increasing methyl bromide use (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.42; 95\u00a0% CI, 0.51-3.95 and RR\u00a0=\u00a03.13; 95\u00a0% CI, 1.25-7.80 for low and high use compared with no use; p (trend)\u00a0=\u00a00.02). No other sites displayed a significant monotonic pattern. Although we previously observed an association with prostate cancer (follow-up through 1999), the association did not persist with longer follow-up. We observed a nonsignificant elevated risk of prostate cancer with methyl bromide use among those with a family history of prostate cancer, but the interaction with a family history did not achieve statistical significance.", "Our results provide little evidence of methyl bromide associations with cancer risk for most sites examined; however, we observed a significant exposure-dependent increase in stomach cancer risk. Small numbers of exposed cases and declining methyl bromide use might have influenced our findings. Further study is needed in more recently exposed populations to expand on these results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 6120 Executive Blvd., Bethesda, MD 20892-7240, USA. barrykh@mail.nih.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barry", "ForeName": "Kathryn Hughes", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koutros", "ForeName": "Stella", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lubin", "ForeName": "Jay H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coble", "ForeName": "Joseph B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barone-Adesi", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beane Freeman", "ForeName": "Laura E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandler", "ForeName": "Dale P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoppin", "ForeName": "Jane A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiaomei", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Tongzhang", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alavanja", "ForeName": "Michael C R", "Initials": "MC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "Z01 CP010119", "Acronym": "ImNIH", "Agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T32 CA105666", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ZIA CP010119-16", "Acronym": "ImNIH", "Agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "Z01 ES049030", "Acronym": "ImNIH", "Agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ZIA ES049030-15", "Acronym": "ImNIH", "Agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Causes Control", "NlmUniqueID": "9100846", "ISSNLinking": "0957-5243"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Agricultural Workers' Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confidence Intervals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Iowa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "North Carolina"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poisson Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of interest</b>.
