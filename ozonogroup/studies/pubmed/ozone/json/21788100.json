Present study was designed to assess the impact of ambient (present) and elevated (future) concentrations of O(3) on two cultivars of Indian rice (Oryza sativa L. cvs Malviya dhan 36 and Shivani). Shoot and root lengths, number of leaves and total leaf area were severely affected by both ambient and elevated concentrations of O(3). Photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic efficiency (F(v)/F(m)) were also reduced by O(3) with more drastic effects under elevated levels of O(3). Leaf proteome showed reduction of some major proteins due to O(3). Pollen viability, viable florets plant(-1) and economic yield also showed significant negative impact under O(3)-exposure in both the test cultivars. The experimental findings depict that both the cultivars of rice demonstrate differential response against O(3), and it may help the plant breeders in selection of resistant cultivars for the area having higher concentrations of O(3)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
