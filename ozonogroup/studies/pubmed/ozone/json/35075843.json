Based on the observation data and MCM photochemical model simulation, the formation mechanism and control mechanism of an ozone pollution case in mid-June were analyzed. The study found that, despite the high precipitation during the observation period, ozone concentrations rapidly accumulated and exceeded the limits once the weather cleared, with the 1-h average and 8-h <i>\u03c6</i> (O<sub>3</sub>) exceeding the national ambient air quality standards on 10 days (32% in frequency)and 14 days (45%), respectively. The diurnal variation in O<sub>3</sub> concentration was unimodal and accompanied by the afternoon peak at 16:00. MCM simulation results showed that the daily net reaction rate of O<sub>3</sub> was 20\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, and HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7+NO and RO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7(except CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7)+NO contributed 49.0%-51.1% and 37.3%-40.2% of O<sub>3</sub> generation, respectively. The contribution of the\u00b7OH+NO<sub>2</sub> reaction to the total consumption of O<sub>3</sub> was 35.1%-57.4%. The results of VOCs reactivity, relative incremental reactivity (RIR), and the EKMA curve method showed that the generation of O<sub>3</sub> was more sensitive to alkenes (mainly trans-2-pentene and trans-2-butene)and aromatics (mainly <i>m/p</i>-xylene and toluene)but was negatively sensitive to NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>. In other words, the reduction in VOCs concentration would lead to the decrease in O<sub>3</sub> concentration, whereas the reduction in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> concentration would lead to the increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration. PMF source analysis results showed that volatile sources used by solvents and vehicle exhaust emissions contributed significantly to the above key precursor VOC species. Considering the titration effect of NO from vehicle exhaust emissions on ozone, controlling the use of volatile sources of solvents can realize the control of O<sub>3</sub> pollution accurately and efficiently."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Ji'nan 250101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological Environment Monitoring Center of Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Xin-Yue", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hedong Branch of Linyi Ecologyical Environmental Bureau, Linyi 276034, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Qi", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hedong Branch of Linyi Ecologyical Environmental Bureau, Linyi 276034, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Chun-Mei", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Peng-Cheng", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ling-Jie", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Shi-Yang", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Material Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shu-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Factor Analysis, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35075843", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202106148"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
