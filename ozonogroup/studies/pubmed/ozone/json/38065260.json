BrO3- degradation by advanced reduction processes (ARPs) has gained much attention because of efficient removal and easy integration with ultraviolet disinfection (UV at 254\u00a0nm). In the vacuum UV (VUV, 185/254\u00a0nm)/sulfite system, the elimination kinetics of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> increased by 9-fold and 15-fold comparing with VUV alone and UV/sulfite system. This study further demonstrated the hydrated electron (eaq-) works as the dominant species in BrO3- degradation in alkaline solution, while in the acidic solution the H\u2022 became a secondary reactive species besides e<sub>aq</sub><sup>-</sup>. Hence, the influences of pH, sulfite concentration, dissolved gas and water matrix on effectiveness of degradation kinetics of BrO3- was explored in details. With increasing pH, the proportion of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> species increased and even became the major ones, which also correlated well with the k<sub>obs</sub> (min<sup>-1</sup>) of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> degradation. The stability of e<sub>aq</sub><sup>-</sup> also climbs with increasing pH, while that of H\u2022 drops significantly. Higher sulfite dosage favored a more rapid degradation of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. The presence of dissolved oxygen inhibited BrO3- removal due to the scavenging effect of O<sub>2</sub> toward e<sub>aq</sub><sup>-</sup> and transformed VUV/sulfite-based ARP to an advanced oxidation process (AOP), which was ineffective for BrO3- removal. BrO3- removal was inhibited to varying degrees after anions (e.g., bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)) and humic acid (HA) being added."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
