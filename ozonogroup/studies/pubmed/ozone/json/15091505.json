To examine how EDU affects plant responses to various ozone (O(3)) levels under controlled field conditions, Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Lit was treated with 150 ppm EDU every 14 days and exposed in open-top chambers to charcoal-filtered air (CF), nonfiltered air (NF) or two cf treatments with ozone added. The ozone treatments were proportional additions of one (CF1) and two (CF2) times ambient ozone levels. The mean ozone concentrations in the CF, NF, CF1 and CF2 treatments were 0.98, 14.1, 14.98 and 31.56 nl litre(-1). A two-way split plot ANOVA revealed that shoot dry weight was significantly reduced by ozone. EDU treatment was highly significant for leaf dry weight, root dry weight and shoot dry weight, but not for pod dry weight; leading to a higher biomass of EDU-treated plants. Ozone/EDU interactions were significant for root weight only, indicating that EDU reduced growth suppression by ozone. These results show that EDU action on plant biomass could be interpreted as a delay in senescence since EDU-treated plants showed a significant decreased biomass loss even in the CF treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Plant Ecology, University of Giessen, Heinrich-Buff-Ring 38, D-35392 Giessen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brunsch\u00f6n-Harti", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fangmeier", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00e4ger", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091505", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)00083-p", "0269-7491(94)00083-P"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
