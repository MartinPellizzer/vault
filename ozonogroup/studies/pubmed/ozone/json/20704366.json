Different types of products are generated according to the reactive species being involved. Recently, attention has been focused on two cholesterol aldehydes, 3beta-hydroxy-5beta-hydroxy-B-norcholestane-6beta-carboxyaldehyde (1a) and 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al (1b). These aldehydes can be generated by ozone-, as well as by singlet molecular oxygen-mediated cholesterol oxidation. It has been suggested that 1b is preferentially formed by ozone and 1a is preferentially formed by singlet molecular oxygen. In this study we describe the use of 1-pyrenebutyric hydrazine (PBH) as a fluorescent probe for the detection of cholesterol aldehydes. The formation of the fluorescent adduct between 1a with PBH was confirmed by HPLC-MS/MS. The fluorescence spectra of PBH did not change upon binding to the aldehyde. Moreover, the derivatization was also effective in the absence of an acidified medium, which is critical to avoid the formation of cholesterol aldehydes through Hock cleavage of 5alpha-hydroperoxycholesterol. In conclusion, PBH can be used as an efficient fluorescent probe for the detection/quantification of cholesterol aldehydes in biological samples. Its analysis by HPLC coupled to a fluorescent detector provides a sensitive and specific way to quantify cholesterol aldehydes in the low femtomol range."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica, Instituto de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, CP26077, CEP 05513-970, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansano", "ForeName": "Fernando V", "Initials": "FV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kazaoka", "ForeName": "Rafaella M A", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ronsein", "ForeName": "Graziella E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prado", "ForeName": "Fernanda M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Genaro-Mattos", "ForeName": "Thiago C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uemi", "ForeName": "Miriam", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Mascio", "ForeName": "Paolo", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyamoto", "ForeName": "Sayuri", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20704366", "10.1021/ac1006427"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
