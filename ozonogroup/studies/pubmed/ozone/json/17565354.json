Twenty-nine female subjects, age 19-27 years, were split into two groups; each group was exposed to four conditions: two levels of ozone (<2 and 60-80 p.p.b.) at two outside air supply rates (2.4 and 4.7 l/s per person). A companion study measured the chemicals present in the cabin air during each of the simulated flights. The subjects completed questionnaires to provide subjective assessments of air quality and symptoms typical of complaints experienced during actual flight. Additionally, the subjects' visual acuity, nasal peak flow and skin dryness were measured. Based on self-recorded responses after 3(1/4) h in the simulated aircraft cabin, they judged the air quality and 12 of the symptoms (including eye and nasal irritation, lip and skin dryness, headache, dizziness, mental tension, claustrophobia) to be significantly worse (P<0.05) for the \"ozone\" condition compared to the \"no ozone\" condition. The results indicate that ozone and products of ozone-initiated chemistry are contributing to such complaints, and imply previously unappreciated benefits when ozone is removed from the ventilation air supplied to an aircraft cabin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Technical University of Denmark (DTU), DK-2800 Kgs Lyngby, Denmark. pst@mek.dtu.dk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Str\u00f8m-Tejsen", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weschler", "ForeName": "Charles J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wargocki", "ForeName": "Pawel", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "My\u015bk\u00f3w", "ForeName": "Danuta", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zarzycka", "ForeName": "Julita", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101262796", "ISSNLinking": "1559-0631"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dizziness"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Headache"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phobic Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17565354", "10.1038/sj.jes.7500586", "7500586"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
