The single-pass collection efficiency and clean air delivery rate (CADR) were measured by standard tests using KCl particles in 0.25-0.35\u00a0\u03bcm. Performance was determined using the Deutsch equation and established diffusion and field charging theories and also compared with the commercialized HEPA filter-type air cleaner. Experimental results showed that the single-pass collection efficiency of the ESP ranged from 50 to 95% and decreased with the flow rate (10-20\u00a0m(3) /min), but increased with the voltage applied to the ionizers (6 to 8\u00a0kV) and collection plates (-5 to -7\u00a0kV). The ESP with 18\u00a0m(3) /min achieved a CADR of 12.1\u00a0m(3) /min with a voltage of 8\u00a0kV applied to the ionization stage and with a voltage of -6\u00a0kV applied to the collection stage. The concentration of ozone in the test chamber (30.4\u00a0m(3) ), a maximum value of 5.4\u00a0ppb over 12\u00a0h of continuous operation, was much lower than the current indoor regulation (50\u00a0ppb)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
