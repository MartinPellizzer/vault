Enamel-dentin blocks from human molars were randomly allocated to receive one of the following bleaching protocols (n=15): (HP) 35%-hydrogen peroxide, (VL) violet light, (OZ) ozone, the association between hydrogen peroxide with ozone (OZ+HP) or violet light (VL+HP). All protocols were performed in two sessions with a 48h interval. Color (spectrophotometer) and mineral composition (Raman spectroscopy) were measured before and after the bleaching. Color changes were calculated by \u0394Eab, \u0394E00, and whitening index (WI). The surface roughness was measured with an atomic force microscope. Data were analyzed by One-way or Two-way repeated measure ANOVA followed by the Tukey's test (\u03b1 = 0.05). The lowest color change values (either measured by WI, \u0394Eab, or \u0394E00) were observed for VL and OZ used with no HP. Violet light associate with HP was unable to improve the color changes observed for the peroxide alone, in combination with OZ and HP, the highest color changes were verified. Regardless of bleaching protocol, the bleached enamel presented higher contents of PO4 and CO3 -2 than those observed at baseline. All bleaching protocols resulted in similar enamel surface roughness. Both the VL and the OZ caused reduced effects on the enamel color change when used alone. The ozone therapy improved the bleaching effect in the group that received the association of HP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1086-9319"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials, Dental School, Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia(UFU), Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Tavares", "ForeName": "Nayara Rodrigues Nascimento Oliveira", "Initials": "NRNO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6693-4963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials, Dental School, Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia(UFU), Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Galv\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Alexia da Mata", "Initials": "ADM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7887-8591"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials, Dental School, Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia(UFU), Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dietrich", "ForeName": "Lia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2739-4922"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental School, CEUMA University, S\u00e3o Luis, Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Carvalho", "ForeName": "Roberta Furtado", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2104-5780"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia(UFU), Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Robinson Sabino", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3846-4786"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dentistry, Dental School, Federal University of Sergipe(UFS), Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9 Luis Faria E", "Initials": "ALFE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9358-1339"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials, Dental School, Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia(UFU), Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Gisele Rodrigues da", "Initials": "GRD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz Dent J", "NlmUniqueID": "9214652", "ISSNLinking": "0103-6440"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "50"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34787248", "10.1590/0103-6440202104002", "S0103-64402021000400019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
