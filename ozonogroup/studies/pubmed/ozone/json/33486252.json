BC and aged BC may enhance IL-33 in\u00a0vivo, which may be derived from macrophages. The pro-inflammatory effect of IL-33 makes it essential to determine the source of IL-33, so it guides us to explore how to alleviate lung injury. In this study, a human bronchial epithelial cell line of 16HBE cells was selected, and aged BC (1,4-NQ coated BC and ozone oxidized BC) was used. We found that both BC and aged BC were able to up-regulate the mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 except IL-33. However, the Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (AKTs) pathways remained inactive. After pretreatment with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-33 mRNA expression was significantly increased in 16HBE cells and MAPKs and PI3K/AKT were activated. These results suggested that MAPKs and PI3K/AKT pathways were involved in the elevation of IL-33. Furthermore, epithelial cells are unlikely to be the source of lung inflammation caused by elevated IL-33 in BC and aged BC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
