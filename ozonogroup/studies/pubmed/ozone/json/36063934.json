In this work, we analyzed the impact of drought on HCHO in the South Korea region during the summer period (June, July, and August) from 2005 to 2018 and found increased HCHO due to drought. The tropospheric HCHO column density retrieved by OMI increased by 8.02 % during extreme drought compared to the non-drought period, whereas no significant effect of drought on the NO<sub>2</sub> column was found. Regional variation of HCHO response to drought correlates significantly with the tree percentage of the region. This correlation indicates that the drought-led HCHO increases are most likely driven by the increase in isoprene emissions during drought. Indeed, model predicts isoprene emissions to be higher by 27.87 % during the extreme drought compared to the non-drought period in South Korea. From 2005 to 2018, the HCHO column has been increasing in South Korea by 0.16 \u00d7 10<sup>15</sup> molecules/cm<sup>2</sup>/year (1.56 % per year) during summer months, correlated with the increasing incidences of drought. HCHO increase is linked to higher ozone as most of South Korea is in the NOx-saturated or transitional regime."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
