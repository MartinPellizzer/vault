Measurements were performed in a solid water phantom at the depth of 1.5 cm and SSD = 78.5 cm for cones from 5 to 60 mm. ROFs were also measured using a mobileMOSFET system (Best Medical Canada) and EBT1 and EBT2 GAFCHROMIC\u00ae (ISP, Ashland) radiochromic films. For cone sizes 12.5-60 mm all detector results were in agreement within the measurement uncertainty. The microMOSFET/RADPOS measurements (published corrections applied) yielded ROFs of 0.650 \u00b1 1.9%, 0.811 \u00b1 0.9% and 0.843 \u00b1 1.7% for the 5, 7.5 and 10 mm cones, respectively, and were in excellent agreement with radiochromic film values (averaged for EBT1 and EBT2) of 0.645 \u00b1 1.4%, 0.806 \u00b1 1.1% and 0.859 \u00b1 1.1%. Monte-Carlo calculated correction factors were applied to the RL readings to correct for excessive scatter due to the relatively high effective atomic number of Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> (Z=10.2) compared to water for the 5, 7.5 and 10 mm cones. When these corrections are applied to our RL detector measurements, we obtain ROFs of 0.656 \u00b1 0.3% and 0.815 \u00b1 0.3% and 0.865 \u00b1 0.3% for 5, 7.5 and 10 mm cones. Our study shows that the microMOSFET/RADPOS and optical fiber-coupled RL dosimetry system are well suited for Cyberknife cone output factors measurements over the entire range of field sizes, provided that appropriate correction factors are applied for the smallest cone sizes (5, 7.5 and 10 mm)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Medical Physics, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ottawa, Department of Radiology, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ploquin", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Nuclear Technologies, Technical University of Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kertzscher", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Medical Physics, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ottawa, Department of Radiology, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vandervoort", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Medical Physics, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ottawa, Department of Radiology, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Carleton University, Department of Physics, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cygler", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Nuclear Technologies, Technical University of Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ospedale Di Vicenza, Medical Physics Department, Vicenza, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Francescon", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0425746", "ISSNLinking": "0094-2405"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28516658", "10.1118/1.4740202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
