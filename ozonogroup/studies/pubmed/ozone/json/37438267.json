Using the ISAM module, the sources of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs in a heavy pollution process in Yulin City were quantified. The results showed that on heavy pollution days, the O<sub>3</sub> in Yulin City mainly came from the long-distance transmission outside the simulation area (55.5%), followed by the photochemical reaction of precursors in the simulation area (20.6%, 10.0%, 5.0%, 2.3%, and 2.1%, respectively, in Yulin City, Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Shaanxi Province, 1.2% in Gansu Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Henan Province in total), and initial conditions (0.3%); the remaining sources (23.6%) could not be successfully labeled. Yulin City is in the VOCs control area, and its VOCs were composed of paraffin (76.5%), ketones (9.2%), and other types of VOCs (14.3%). The VOCs came from the emission of pollution sources in the simulation area (45.6%, 22.0%, 11.4%, 6.3%, and 5.1%, respectively, in Yulin City, Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Shaanxi Province, 0.8% in Gansu Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Henan Province in total) and the long-distance transmission outside the simulation area (27.9%); the remaining 26.5% were not successfully marked. This research showed that to control the O3 pollution in Yulin, not only should the local VOCs emissions be controlled, but the overall planning of VOCs emissions in the peripheral areas should also be done well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi-Fan", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Ji-Long", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu-Xiang", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong-le", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Ao", "ForeName": "Cong-Jie", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hao-Tian", "Initials": "HT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37438267", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202207003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
