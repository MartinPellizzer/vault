Here, we showed the microbial diversity in 46 lakes and assessed the influence of 27 anthropogenic factors. We found that the economic level (e.g., per capita gross domestic product) was strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.97) with bacterial diversity but positively correlated (r = 0.17) with fungal diversity in lakes. The composition of the microbial community significantly changed with increasing economic level. Bacteria are more sensitive than fungi to anthropogenic impacts. Expanding the population size and increasing the economic level may promote the development of fungal diversity but inhibit bacterial diversity. Air quality, urbanization and ozone were negatively correlated with bacterial diversity, and fisheries had a negative correlation with fungal diversity. The anti-interference ability of lake microorganisms in the middle economic level zones (45,000-90,000 yuan/person) was stronger than that in high-level (> 90,000 yuan/person) and low-level (> 45,000 yuan/person) economic zones. Overall, our investigation provides national-scale evidence that changes in the microbial diversity in lakes were related to economic levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
