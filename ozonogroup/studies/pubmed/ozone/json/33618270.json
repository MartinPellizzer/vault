So far, little is known about the effects of chemical oxidation on leachates and properties of MPs. Here, we investigated the removal of pigment red from MPs by ozonation, Fenton, and heat-activated persulfate treatments, and further explored the nanoscale surface properties of treated MPs. Experimental results indicated that advanced oxidation processes effectively degraded pigment red released from MPs and the degradation rate was much faster than the leaching rate of pigments. Dominant reactive oxygen radicals in the ozone, Fenton, and heat-activated persulfate systems were identified as O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>, HO\u2022, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>, respectively. Height ranges of untreated, ozone-treated, Fenton-treated, and persulfate-treated MPs were 73\u00a0nm, 163\u00a0nm, 195\u00a0nm, and 206\u00a0nm, respectively. Oxidation of the -CH<sub>3</sub> and -CH<sub>2</sub> bonds occurred on the surface of treated MPs and the persulfate system achieved more serious oxidation degree than the ozone and Fenton systems. Addition of pigment red to the plastic polymer increased the glass transition temperature of MPs, which then showed a decline after advanced oxidation treatments except Fenton. The surface of persulfate-treated MPs was the stiffest, but the stiffness distribution of the ozone-treated and Fenton-treated MPs was more uneven. These research findings provide promising strategies to accelerate the aging process of MPs and contribute to a better understanding of the effects of aging on the environmental behavior of MPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
