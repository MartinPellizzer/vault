We used the latest MEGAN3.1 model, updated vegetation data and emission factors, combined with MODIS data analysis to simulate and estimate the integrated emissions of BVOC from nine provinces in China's Yellow River Basin in 2018. Following an extensive evaluation of the WRF-CMAQ model utilizing diverse parameters, the simulated and observed values had correlation coefficients between them that ranged from 0.94 to 0.99, implying a favorable outcome in terms of simulation efficacy. The findings from the simulation analysis reveal that the combined BVOC emissions from the nine provinces in the Yellow River Basin reached a total of 6.51\u00a0Tg in 2018. Among these provinces, Sichuan, Henan, and Shaanxi ranked highest, with emissions of 1.28\u00a0Tg, 1.04\u00a0Tg, and 0.96\u00a0Tg, respectively. BVOC emissions led to concentrations of 36.72 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 in the daily maximum 8-h ozone and 0.59 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 in the average SOA in nine provinces of the Yellow River Basin in July. Isoprene contributed the most to the O<sub>3</sub> production with 6.31 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and monoterpenes contributed the most to SOA production with 0.45 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. \u0394SOA and \u0394Ozone are mainly distributed in the belts of central Sichuan Province, southern Shaanxi Province, western Henan Province, northern Qinghai Province, central Inner Mongolia, and southern Shanxi Province, and most of these areas are located 50\u00a0km around the Yellow River. O<sub>3</sub> and SOA in Taiyuan, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou cities are strongly influenced by the generation of BVOCs.
