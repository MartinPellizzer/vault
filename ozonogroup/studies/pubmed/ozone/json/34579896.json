Various types of ultraviolet (UV) instrument are currently in use to greatly enhance the antibacterial activity and osteoconductive capability of titanium, it remains unclear how UV treatment modulates immune response. Compared to traditional UV treatment, the combination of low-dose ozone with UV irradiation is considered a new option to give benefits to surface modification and reduce the drawbacks of UV and ozone individually. Herein, the aim of this study was to elucidate the immune-modulatory properties of macrophages on UV/ozone-irradiated titanium that serve as defense against S. aureus and the crosstalk between immune cells and osteoblasts. Three different cell and bacteria co-culture systems were developed in order to investigate the race between host cells and bacteria to occupy the surface. In vitro immunological experiments indicated that UV/ozone irradiation significantly enhanced the phagocytic and bactericidal activity of macrophages against S. aureus. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies evidenced the favorable osteoimmune environment for osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. This research suggests vital therapeutic potential of UV/ozone irradiation for preventing the biomaterial-associated infections and achieving favorable bone formation simultaneously."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
