For large-scale monitoring projects that examine spatial variations of a pollutant and human exposure assessments, passive sampling devices can provide the methodology to meet monitoring and statistical goals. Recently, we developed a coated filter for ozone collection that we used in a commercially available passive sampling device. Successful preliminary results merited further validation tests, which are presented in this report. The passive ozone sampler used in field and laboratory experiments consists of a badge clip supporting a barrel-shaped body that contains two coated glass fiber filters. The principle component of the coating is nitrite ion, which in the presence of ozone is oxidized to nitrate ion on the filter medium (NO2- + O3 produces NO3- + O2). After sample collection, the filters were extracted with ultrapure water and analyzed for nitrate ion by ion chromatography. The results from laboratory and field validation tests indicated excellent agreement between the passive method and standard ozone monitoring techniques. We determined that relative humidity (ranging from 10% to 80%) and temperature (ranging from 0 degrees C to 40 degrees C) at typical ambient ozone levels (40 to 100 parts per billion) do not influence sampler performance. Face velocity and sampler orientation with respect to wind direction were found to affect the sampler's collection rate of ozone. Using a protective cup, which acts as both a wind screen and a rain cover, we were able to obtain a constant collection rate over a wide range of wind speeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolfson", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bunyaviroch", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Froehlich", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Res Rep Health Eff Inst", "NlmUniqueID": "8812230", "ISSNLinking": "1041-5505"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8185875"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
