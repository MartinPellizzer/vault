In order to maintain the structural stability and surface catalytic activity of heterogeneous catalysts during the HCO treatment of electroless nickel plating effluent (ENPE), a MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst with a core-shell structure was synthesized. MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was characterized and applied in the removal of total nickel (T<sub>Ni</sub>) and organic contaminants from actual ENPE, using a coupled system of HCO combined with a magnetic dithiocarbamate chelating resin (MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>-MDCR). Results show that embedding Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with C and MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> significantly increased the T<sub>Ni</sub> removal efficiency (99.3%), enhanced the O<sub>3</sub>-utilization efficiency and improved the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reaction rate (k\u00a0=\u00a00.7641\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) and O<sub>3</sub>-utilization efficiency established for T<sub>Ni</sub> removal (\u0394T<sub>Ni</sub>/\u0394O<sub>3</sub> =0.221) by the MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>-MDCR system, were 220% and 140% higher than the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>-MDCR system, respectively. Catalytic mechanism analysis demonstrated that surface hydroxyl groups, oxygen vacancy, metals, the carbon surface and its functional groups, can all potentially serve as catalytic active sites, with <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and \u2022OH considered to the predominant ROS. Overall, these findings verify that the synthesized MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst possesses excellent catalytic capabilities and outstanding structural stability, making it suitable for practical application in the treatment of wastewater effluent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
