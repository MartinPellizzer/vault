However, knowledge about effects of atmospheric oxidation on stroke and its interactions with fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) are still limited. In this study, we investigated the short-term effects of ambient NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and their combined oxidation (O<sub>wt</sub>) on first-ever stroke, based on data from the China National Stroke Screening Survey (CNSSS) conducted from 2013 to 2015. We found significant association between ambient NO<sub>2</sub> exposure at lag0 day with first-ever stroke, with a 13.1\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 3.5\u00a0%, 23.6\u00a0%) increase in the first-ever stroke risk per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> exposure. We also found a significant interaction between NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05): first-ever stroke risk increased 23.8\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 9.6\u00a0%, 39.8\u00a0%) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> NO<sub>2</sub> exposure in population exposed to higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, while no significant association was found in population exposed to lower PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. The results of stratified analyses indicated that physical inactivity enhanced the detrimental effects of O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>wt</sub> exposure, while smoking and transient ischemic attack (TIA) history enhanced the detrimental effects of NO<sub>2</sub> exposure. However, TIA history appeared to mitigate the adverse effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure. This study is helpful to better understand the impact of ambient oxidation on stroke, as well as its interaction with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and has implications for policies and standards for atmospheric protection and governance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
