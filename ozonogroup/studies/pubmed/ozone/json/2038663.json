In this paper, results are presented of experiments into the consumption and reaction kinetics of chlorine dioxide in a number of (drinking) waters in The Netherlands. It was found that chlorine dioxide consumption is related to the dissolved oxygen content (DOC) of the water and the reaction time. Water samples from a plant that applied ozonation and activated carbon filtration had a very low chlorine dioxide consumption. Other water quality parameters, including pH and CO3(2-), did not have any influence on consumption. The temporary advised Dutch guidelines of 0.2 mg l-1 (dosage) is sufficient for activated carbon treated water. For other Dutch drinking waters, however, none of the 0.2 mg l-1 chlorine dioxide remained after a reaction time of 10 min, as was also found for the water of Dutch pumping stations where chlorine dioxide is at present used for disinfection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wondergem", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Dijk-Looijaard", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8061YMS4RM", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorine dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Netherlands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2038663", "10.1016/0048-9697(91)90309-3", "0048-9697(91)90309-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
