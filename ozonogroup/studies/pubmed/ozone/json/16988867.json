PAH depositional flux ranged from 64.1 to 610 microg/m2/y for the urban area and from 65 to 460 microg/m2/y for the suburban area. The fluxes of PAHs measured in this study were comparable with those reported for urban and suburban areas in other countries. The fluxes of particulates and PAHs were higher in winter than in summer, consistent with the greater per capita consumption of fossil fuel in winter than in summer. Ambient temperature played a major role in the seasonal variability in PAH fluxes. Photochemical degradation of PAHs appears to occur during the summer months. The relationship of PAH depositional fluxes with major air pollutants, such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and presence of particulate matter up to 10 microm in size (PM10), was also investigated. Dominant PAH compounds in both the urban and the suburban locations were benzo[g,h,i]perylene, pyrene, and indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene. Based on the PAH diagnostic ratios and a factor analysis, the major sources of PAHs in the urban and the suburban regions were found to be similar. Diesel exhaust, coal combustion, and gasoline emissions contributed predominantly to atmospheric PAH contamination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine Environment Management Team, National Fisheries Research and Development Institute, 408-1, Sirang-ri, Gijang-eup, Gijang-gun, Busan, 619-902, Korea. hbmoon@nfrdi.re.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "H-B", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kannan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S-J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ok", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0357245", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4341"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16988867", "10.1007/s00244-006-0002-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
