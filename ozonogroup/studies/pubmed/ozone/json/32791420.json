Therefore, other pretreatment methods to effectively remove these harmful substances in the water during treatment are needed. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of microbubble pre-ozonation pH on the reduction of THM4 and HAA5 formed during the peat water treatment process and to determine the best conditions for microbubble pre-ozonation to reduce the formation of these two classes of DBPs. The microbubble pre-ozonation was conducted at a pH of 5.5, 7, and 8.5. Furthermore, the primary treatments applied after this pretreatment were coagulation and activated carbon adsorption before post-chlorine disinfection. The coagulation process using aluminum sulfate and activated carbon adsorption succeeded in reducing the formation of THM4 after chlorination, to a level below USEPA standards, but the concentration of HAA5 was still high. However, the use of microbubble pre-ozonation significantly reduced the formation of both classes of compounds during the chlorination process of the peat water. Also, the concentration of THM4 increased during the pre-ozonation process in all pH conditions, but HAA5 decreased except in alkaline state. Furthermore, the ideal conditions for microbubble pre-ozonation on peat water were at pH\u00a07 (neutral) after 30\u00a0min, with the total THM4 concentration at 33.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0\u03bcg/L, and that of HAA5 at 49.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0\u03bcg/L, falling below the USEPA standard."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
