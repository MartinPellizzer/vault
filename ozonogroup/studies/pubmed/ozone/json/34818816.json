The influence of PMS dosages, ozone concentrations, pH, Br<sup>-</sup> and humic acid (HA) on NDMA formation from UDMH were investigated. In addition, the reduction mechanisms were explored by intermediates identification and Gaussian calculation. The results demonstrated that O<sub>3</sub>/PMS technology was effective on NDMA reduction, reaching an efficiency of 81% with 80\u00a0\u03bcM PMS. Higher NDMA reduction rates were achieved by O<sub>3</sub>/PMS with increasing pH within the scope of research (from 5 to 9), achieving a maximum of 69.9% at pH\u00a09. The presence of bromide ion facilitated NDMA generation during ozonation, but the reduction efficiency by O<sub>3</sub>/PMS slightly improved from 66.3% to 70.6%. The presence of HA reduced NDMA formation in O<sub>3</sub>/PMS system. The contribution of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> on NDMA reduction accounted for ~64%, which was higher than that of \u2022OH (41.4%); however, its promotion role on conversing UDMH to NDMA was lower than O<sub>3</sub>. Therefore, the technology could reduce NDMA formation effectively. In addition, the results of Gaussian calculation manifested that the N atom in -NH<sub>2</sub> group of UDMH was easily attacked not only by \u2022OH but also by O<sub>3</sub>, so it is the key path that determines final NDMA formation.
