Ethylenediurea (EDU) is a chemical compound which is widely used in research projects as phytoprotectant against O<sub>3</sub> injury. The EDU mode of action remains still unclear, while there are indications that EDU may contribute to plants with nitrogen (N) when the soil is poor in N and the plants have relatively small leaf area. To reveal whether the N content of EDU acts as a fertilizer to plants when the soil is not poor in N and the plants have relatively large total plant leaf area, willow plants (Salix sachalinensis Fr. Schm) were exposed to low ambient O<sub>3</sub> levels and treated ten times (9-day interval) with 200mL soil drench containing 0, 800 or 1600mg EDU L<sup>-1</sup>. Fertilizer was added to a nutrient-poor soil, and the plants had an average plant leaf area of 9.1m<sup>2</sup> at the beginning of EDU treatments. Indications for EDU-induced hormesis in maximum electron transport rate (J<sub>max</sub>) and ratio of intercellular to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (C<sub>i</sub>:C<sub>a</sub>) were observed at the end of the experiment. No other EDU-induced effects on leaf greenness and N content, maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>), gas exchange, growth and matter production suggest that EDU did not act as N fertilizer and did not cause toxicity under these experimental conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
