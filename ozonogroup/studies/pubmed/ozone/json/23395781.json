In vitro ozonization of C16:0-CE was found to form the palmitoyl ester of secosterol-A (3\u03b2-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al) and its aldolization product secosterol-B (3\u03b2-hydroxy-5\u03b2-hydroxy-B-norcholestane-6\u03b2-carboxaldehyde). On the other hand, when C18:1-CE and C18:2-CE were oxidized by ozone, the aldehyde 9-oxononanoyl cholesterol (9-ONC) was formed as a primary product, which was then further oxidized to form 9-oxononanoyl secosterol-A (9-ON-secoA) and 9-oxononanoyl secosterol-B (9-ON-secoB). The compounds 9-ON-secoA and -B, but not 9-ONC, were found to exhibit strong cytotoxicity against human leukemia HL-60 cells. An LC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed for the detection of these cholesteryl ester ozonolysis products by derivatizing them with dansyl hydrazine. Using this method, we found for the first time that low concentrations of 9-ON-secoA and -B, but not palmitoyl secosterols, were present in human LDL. These novel oxidized cholesterol esters, 9-ON-secoA and -B, probably play important roles in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders such as cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.
