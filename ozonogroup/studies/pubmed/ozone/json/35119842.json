Fragments (<i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 61.0766, 60.0688 Da loss, and 72.0688 Da loss) were discovered as pertinent diagnostic fragments for precursors bearing (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N-N, whereas a loss of 108.0119 Da was consistent for precursors bearing (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N-S(O<sub>2</sub>)-N. Using the fragments as structural hints on a sewage fraction with a high concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-reactive precursors, peaks of precursors sharing <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 61.0766, a 60.0688 Da loss, or both were flagged. Then, using <i>in silico</i> fragmenters and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N-N as a substructure filter on online-chemical structure databases, we identified PubChem's compound identifier (PCCID) 141210417 and 1,1,1',1'-tetramethyl-4,4'-(methylene-di-<i>p</i>-phenylene)disemicarbazide (TMDS). TMDS was confirmed using an authentic standard, and ion mobility (IM)-QTOF/MS confirmed its rider peak as PCCID 141210417. PCCID 141210417 is an isomer of TMDS, and its environmental occurrence is associated with technical-grade TMDS and industrial effluents. The estimated contribution of TMDS to the total NDMA formation potential of the sewage fraction was 20-24%, which was suggestive of the significance of PCCID 141210417 and other precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4689-5447"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Katsura, Nishikyo-ku, Kyoto 615-8540, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hinneh", "ForeName": "Klon D C", "Initials": "KDC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5008-8977"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, National Institute of Public Health, Wako, Saitama 351-0197, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kosaka", "ForeName": "Koji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Global Environmentally-Friendly Industries for Sustainable Development, Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Yoshida-honmachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan."}], "LastName": "Echigo", "ForeName": "Shinya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Katsura, Nishikyo-ku, Kyoto 615-8540, Japan."}], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "Sadahiko", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35119842", "10.1021/acs.est.1c05888"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
