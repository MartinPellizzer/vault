The aim of this study was to determine the singlet oxygen generation potential of some commonly used antibiotics so that due precautions can be exercised to minimize their photosensitizing action and oxidative stress potential. The selected antibiotics were examined for their ability to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) under artificial UVA (320-400 nm). Singlet oxygen generation of various screened antibiotics under UVA is of the following order: Nalidixic acid > Amphotericin-B > Cephradine > Cefazolin > Nafcillin > Cephalothin > Ampicillin > Cephalexin > Puromycin > Kanamycin > Lincomycin > Tetracycline > Nystatin > Gentamicin sulphate. Nalidixic acid, the most potent generator of 1O2 among the screened antibiotics, was selected to carry out further studies. Certain specific quenchers of 1O2 such as beta-carotene, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane (DABCO), and sodium azide (NaN3) accorded significant inhibition in the production of 1O2. The results suggest that precautions are necessary to avoid ultraviolet radiation after the intake of photoreactive drugs, especially in tropical countries such as India. These findings are significant because UVB radiation is reportedly increasing on earth surface in part due to depletion of stratospheric ozone layer. The selected drugs are commonly used for the treatment of various diseases. Thus, the synergistic action of both can lead to undesirable phototoxic responses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Dr. R. M. L.
