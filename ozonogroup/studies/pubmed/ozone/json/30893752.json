Here we present the accumulation and allocation of biomass in poplar clone 546 (Populus deltoides cv. '55/56'\u202f\u00d7\u202fP. deltoides cv. 'Imperial') for one growing season at two O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (charcoal-filtered air [CF] and non-filtered air\u202f+\u202f40\u202fppb of O<sub>3</sub> [E-O<sub>3</sub>]), two watering regimes (well-watered [WW] and reduced watering at 40% of WW irrigation [RW]) and two soil nitrogen addition treatments (no addition [N0] and the addition of 50\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha<sup>-1</sup>\u202fyear<sup>-1</sup> [N50]). We found that the deleterious effects of E-O<sub>3</sub> depended on the supply of water and nitrogen. Specifically, when the supplies of water and/or N (WW and/or N50) were abundant, E-O<sub>3</sub> significantly reduced whole plant biomass by >15% but had no significant effect on biomass when these supplies were limited (RW and N0). A significant reduction of biomass by E-O<sub>3</sub> occurred earlier in fine roots than in other plant organs, indicating greater sensitivity of fine root to E-O<sub>3</sub>. These results suggest that rising O<sub>3</sub> concentrations may not ubiquitously lead to a large reduction in plant biomass since plant growth is often jointly constrained by water and nutrients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
