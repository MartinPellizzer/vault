To better understand the influence of different concrete mixtures, data was collected from Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). Data from 39,213 U.S.A. ready-mix concrete EPDs was obtained from public repositories provided by the American Society for Testing and Materials and the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association. The EPDs in .pdf format were analyzed using a custom Python script to extract useful information for building designers, sustainability practitioners, and researchers including: life cycle assessment (LCA) midpoints (Global Warming Potential, Ozone Depletion Potential, Acidification Potential, Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential, Abiotic Depletion, Total Waste Disposed, and Consumption of Freshwater), concrete strength classes, declared unit, concrete curing time, production components, concrete manufacturers' company and plant locations, and additional LCA information. Both the dataset and an example of the Python script used to extract the information from the EPDs are provided. This dataset enables users to quickly assess the environmental impacts (including the Global Warming Potential) of different concrete mixtures without the need for extensive data collection and analysis. In summary, this dataset provides environmental information about concrete mixtures to aid civil engineering and architectural researchers, sustainability consultants, building engineering practitioners, and environmental policymakers to make sustainability-informed decisions when specifying concrete in the U.S.A."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Architectural Engineering, 104 Engineering Unit A, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}], "LastName": "Broyles", "ForeName": "Jonathan Michael", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Architectural Engineering, 104 Engineering Unit A, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Gevaudan", "ForeName": "Juan Pablo", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Architectural Engineering, 104 Engineering Unit A, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Nathan Collin", "Initials": "NC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "American Society for Testing and Materials, Environmental Product Declarations, ASTM, 2023 First accessed on February 13th Retrieved from https://www.astm.org/products-services/certification/environmental-product-declarations/epd-pcr.html."}, {"Citation": "National Ready Mixed Concrete Association,   NRMCA; 2023.
