The effects of concentration of reactants, temperature, and pH on toxins degradation were monitored and the reaction kinetics was assessed. O(3) alone or combined with either H(2)O(2) or Fe(II) were efficient treatment for toxins elimination. A higher toxin oxidation tendency was observed with Fenton reaction; total toxins degradation (MC-LR and MC-RR) was achieved in only 60s. The ozonation treatment was successfully described by second-order kinetics model, with a first-order with respect to the concentration of either ozone or toxin. At 20 degrees C, with initial concentration of MC-LR of 1mg/L, the overall second-order reaction rate constant ranged from 6.79 x 10(4) to 3.49 x 10(3)M(-1)s(-1) as the solution pH increased from 2 to 11. The reaction kinetics of the other AOPs (O(3)/H(2)O(2), O(3)/Fe(II), and Fenton), were fitted to pseudo first-order kinetics. A rapid reaction was observed to took place at higher initial concentrations of O(3), H(2)O(2) and Fe(II), and higher temperatures. At pH 3, initial concentration of toxin of 1mg/L, the pseudo first-order rate constant, achieved by Fenton process, was in order of 8.76+/-0.7s(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Mutah University, Jordan. fares1233@mutah.edu.jo"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al Momani", "ForeName": "Fares", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Daniel W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gamal El-Din", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17560023", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.04.087", "S0304-3894(07)00593-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
