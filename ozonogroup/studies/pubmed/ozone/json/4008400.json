We hypothesized that exposure to near-threshold concentrations of these pollutants would allow us to observe any interaction between the two pollutants that might have been masked by the more obvious response to the higher concentrations of O3 used in previous studies. Each subject alternated 30-min treadmill exercise with 10-min rest periods for the 2 h. The average exercise ventilation measured during the last 5 min of exercise was 38 1/min (BTPS). Forced expiratory maneuvers were performed before exposure and 5 min after each of the three exercise periods. Maximum voluntary ventilation, He dilution functional residual capacity, thoracic gas volume, and airway resistance were measured before and after the exposure. After O3 exposure alone, forced expiratory measurements (FVC, FEV1.0, and FEF25-75%) were significantly decreased. The combined exposure to SO2 + O3 produced similar but smaller decreases in these measures. There were small but significant differences between the O3 and the O3 + SO2 exposure for FVC, FEV1.0, FEV2.0, FEV3.0, and FEF25-75% at the end of the 2-h exposure. We conclude that, with these pollutant concentrations, there is no additive or synergistic effect of the two pollutants on pulmonary function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bedi", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horvath", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Volume Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4008400", "10.1152/jappl.1985.58.6.1783"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
