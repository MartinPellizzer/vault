Hanno) was grown at ambient (350 micromol mol(-1)) or elevated CO(2) (700 micromol mol(-1)) in charcoal/Purafil-filtered air (CFA <5 nmol mol(-1)) or ozone (CFA +75 nmol mol(-1) 7 h d(-1)) at three levels of N supply (1.5, 4 and 14 mM NO(-3)), to test the hypothesis that the combined impacts of elevated CO(2) and O(3) on plant growth and photosynthetic capacity are affected by nitrogen availability. Shifts in foliar N content reflected the level of N supplied, and the growth stimulation induced by elevated CO(2) was dependent on the level of N supply. At 60 d after transfer (DAT), elevated CO(2) was found to increase total biomass by 44%, 29%, 12% in plants supplied with 14, 4 and 1.5 mM NO(-3), respectively, and there was no evidence of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO(2) across N treatments; the maximum in vivo rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V(cmax)) was similar in plants raised at elevated and ambient CO(2). At 60 DAT, ozone exposure was found to suppress plant relative growth rate (RGR) and net photosynthesis (A) in plants supplied with 14 and 4 mM NO(-3). However, O(3) had no effect on the RGR of plants supplied with 1.5 mM NO(-3) and this effect was accompanied by a reduced impact of the pollutant on A. Elevated CO(2) counteracted the detrimental effects of O(3) (i.e. the same ozone concentration that depressed RGR and A at ambient CO(2) resulted in no significant effects when plants were raised at elevated CO(2)) at all levels of N supply and the effect was associated with a decline in O(3) uptake at the leaf level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Laboratory, Department of Agricultural and Environmental Science, Ridley Building, The University of Newcastle, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cardoso-Vilhena", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acclimatization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11520879", "10.1093/jexbot/52.362.1901"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
