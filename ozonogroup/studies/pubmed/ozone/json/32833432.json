However, previously identified compounds only account for a small fraction of the total dissolved organic carbon remaining after reverse osmosis treatment. Uncharged carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) formed during oxidation have rarely been monitored in potable water reuse systems. To determine the relative importance of these compounds to final product water quality, samples were collected from six potable water reuse facilities and one conventional drinking water treatment plant. Saturated carbonyl compounds (e.g., formaldehyde, acetone) and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes (e.g., acrolein, crotonaldehyde) were quantified with a sensitive new analytical method. Relatively high concentrations of carbonyls (i.e., above 7 \u03bcM) were observed after ozonation of wastewater effluent. Biological filtration reduced concentrations of carbonyls by over 90%. Rejection of the carbonyls during reverse osmosis was correlated with molecular weight, with concentrations decreasing by 33% to 58%. Transformation of carbonyls resulted in decreases in concentration of 10% to 90% during advanced oxidation, with observed decreases consistent with rate constants for reactions of the compounds with hydroxyl radicals. Overall, carbonyl compounds accounted for 19% to 38% of the dissolved organic carbon in reverse osmosis-treated water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Marron", "ForeName": "Emily L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1470-141X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Prasse", "ForeName": "Carsten", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, United States."}], "LastName": "Buren", "ForeName": "Jean Van", "Initials": "JV"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1686-8464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Sedlak", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P42 ES004705", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "National Research Council.
