This study compares the ability of several AOPs, including ozone, ozone+H2O2, low pressure UV (LP)+H2O2, and medium pressure UV (MP)+H2O2 in terms of energy required to produce OH radicals. Bench scale OH radical formation data was generated for each AOP using para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as an OH radical probe compound in three waters, Lake Greifensee water, Lake Zurich water, and a simulated groundwater. Ozone-based AOPs were found to be more energy efficient than the UV/H2O2 process at all H2O2 levels, and the addition of H2O2 in equimolar concentration resulted in 35% greater energy consumption over the ozone only process. Interestingly, the relatively high UV/AOP operational costs were due almost exclusively to the cost of hydrogen peroxide while the UV portion of the UV/AOP process typically accounted for less than 10 percent of the UV/AOP cost and was always less than the ozone energy cost. As the *OH radical exposure increased, the energy gap between UV/H2O2 AOP and ozone processes decreased, becoming negligible in some water quality scenarios."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Eawag, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenfeldt", "ForeName": "Erik J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linden", "ForeName": "Karl G", "Initials": "KG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Canonica", "ForeName": "Silvio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Water Res. 2008 May;42(10-11):2836-8"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17078993", "10.1016/j.watres.2006.09.008", "S0043-1354(06)00514-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
