In this study, a DBD reactor followed by a wet scrubber (WS) containing a solution of metal ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup>) was used to reuse ozone for further oxidation of typical VOC toluene. Compared with the degradation effect of the DBD reactor alone, DBD coupled WS/iron system not only improved the toluene removal efficiency but also significantly reduced the ozone emission. The ozone removal efficiency reached as high as 98% in the DBD coupled WS/Fe<sup>2+</sup> system. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests showed that ozone was converted into radicals such as hydroxyl radicals in Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> solution, which further oxidized toluene in WS/iron. Quenching experiments showed that the contribution for toluene degradation by radicals was up to 75% and 62% in Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> reactor, respectively. This study demonstrates that the DBD coupled WS system has the potential to be an environmentally friendly technology for gaseous VOCs removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
