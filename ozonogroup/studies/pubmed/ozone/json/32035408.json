It was found that this procedure worked well in a wide range of pH, the existence of iron foam in ozonation system markedly elevated the mineralization level of organic contaminants. Within the reaction time of 120\u00a0min, iron foam combined ozonation achieved 53% of DOC removal percentage, which was 21% higher than that of ozone alone. Meanwhile, the biodegradability of the pharmaceutical wastewater was improved, a large part of the organic pollutants containing benzene rings and amino groups were effectively degraded, and a certain amount of phosphate and nitrogen also get removed. In iron foam combined ozonation, zero valent iron played the role as an activator. It was oxidized into iron oxides and oxyhydroxides, the electrons transferring among different valences of iron stimulated the decomposition of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which accounted for most of the organic contaminants degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
