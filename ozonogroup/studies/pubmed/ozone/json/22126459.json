In this system, reclaimed water after ozonation was used as the feed water, and 60% dissolved organic carbon was removed by the unsaturated vadose layer in 0.8\u00a0days. Soil biomass (volatile solids, phospholipid extraction) and functional diversity significantly decreased from the unsaturated vadose layer to the saturated aquifer, where they maintained the same level. Using principal components analysis based on substrate utilization pattern, the vadose layer soil sample was clearly separated from the saturated layer samples. Exceptionally, the oxidation rates of esters remained stable during SAT, indicating the purification potential on certain recalcitrant organic compounds in the saturated aquifer given an adequate retention time. Correlation analysis revealed that organic carbon was the key limiting factor for microbial biomass and activity, especially for tyrosine-like aromatic proteins and soluble microbial byproduct-like materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
