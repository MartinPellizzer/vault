The participants in Group A (55 patients) were given intra-articular ozonized PRP and hyaluronate therapeutics, following arthroscopic suturing of meniscal tear treatment (ASMT) of degenerative knee joint OA. Group B (49 patients) was prepared for APM alone. Both groups were followed by physical therapy and a follow up visit throughout 12, 24, and 36\u00a0months. The WOMAC and Lequesne scores were evaluated.", "At every follow up visit for 6, 12, and 24, months, there was a significant decline in the mean of WOMAC and Lequesne scores in Groups A and B relative to baseline. Additionally, Group A significantly (P<0.0001) outperformed Group B at 12, 24, and 36\u00a0months for both Lequesne's and WOMAC scores. There were infection, stiffness, and widespread OA knee degeneration detected in Group B while no serious adverse effects were observed in Group A.", "The study's findings demonstrated that physical and intra-articular orthobiological ozonized PRP and hyaluronate therapies were more effective than APM in treating degenerative knee joint OA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
