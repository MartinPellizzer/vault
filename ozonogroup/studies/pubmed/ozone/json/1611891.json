The simulations predicted the dynamic behavior of gas phase concentration profiles for both ozone and an insoluble inert gas. An internal quasi-stationary diffusion front was observed during early inspiration for both gases. In addition, the absorptive distribution of ozone in lung airways was computed as a total dose as well as a tissue dose. The total dose of ozone decreased along the airway path from the mouth. However, the tissue dose of ozone increased along the conducting airways, reached a maximal dose in the terminal bronchioles, and decreased sharply in the respiratory airways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben-Jebria", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ultman", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Comput Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0100331", "ISSNLinking": "0010-4809"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Transport"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1611891", "10.1016/0010-4809(92)90042-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
