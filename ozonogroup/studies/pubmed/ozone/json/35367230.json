The mean concentrations of total measured amines (\u01a9amines) in fine particles were 208\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0127, 63.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.3, and 120\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.1\u00a0ng\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> during haze, low pollution-low RH (LP-LRH), and low pollution-high RH (LP-HRH) episodes, respectively. The dominant amine species were methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), diethylamine (DEA) and dibutylamine (DBA), which in total accounted for 82-91% of the \u01a9amines during different pollution episodes. The contributions of \u01a9amines-C to water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and \u01a9amines-N to water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) were 1.52% and 2.49% during haze, 1.24% and 1.96% during LP-LRH, and 2.00 and 2.98% during LP-HRH days, respectively. The mass proportion of \u01a9amines in fine particles was higher during LP-HRH periods (0.19%) than during haze and LP-LRH periods (0.16%). The mass proportion of DBA in \u01a9amines increased from 7% during haze and LP-LRH episodes to 25% during LP-HRH episodes. Compared with other amines, DBA showed a stronger linear relationship with RH (r\u00a0=\u00a00.867, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), which demonstrates its high sensitivity to high RH conditions. Meteorological parameters (including RH, the mixed layer depth, wind speed and temperature), the oxidizing capacity (ozone concentration), and gaseous pollutants (NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>) correlated with amines under different pollution conditions. Under high RH, acid-base reactions were the dominant pathway for the gas-to-particle distribution of amines in urban areas, while direct dissolution dominated in the background site. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to conduct in situ measurements of particulate amines during different pollution conditions in China, and further research is needed to in-depth understanding of the influence of amines on haze formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
