The CuO/<i>\u03b1</i>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite was characterised by X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer technique. The decomposition efficiency and energy yield of gaseous chlorobenzene in DBD catalysis system were studied by a function of gas flow rate, initial concentration and input voltage. The results showed that the CuO/<i>\u03b1</i>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite catalyst exhibited remarkable performance on chlorobenzene decomposition when the molar ratio was 0.4 and calcination temperature was 450\u00b0C. When the chlorobenzene initial concentration was 230\u2005mg\u2005m<sup>-3</sup>, the chlorobenzene decomposition efficiency and mineralisation rate on the DBD catalysis system reached 73.33% and 63.37%, respectively, its decomposition and mineralisation efficiency were enhanced about 20.5% and 16.61%, respectively, compared with the bare DBD system, and it also benefited to significantly reduce the ozone and NO<sub>2</sub> by-products. The possible pathway of chlorobenzene decomposition in the DBD catalytic hybrid system was proposed based on the products analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment & Pollution Control, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Nanominerals and Pollution Control of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Linxuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment & Pollution Control, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Analysis & Measurement, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment & Pollution Control, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Nanominerals and Pollution Control of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Ganggui", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment & Pollution Control, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Nanominerals and Pollution Control of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jieyu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment & Pollution Control, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Nanominerals and Pollution Control of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Xuehua", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment & Pollution Control, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Nanominerals and Pollution Control of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chengzhu", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33657965", "10.1080/09593330.2021.1899292"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
