In the Shu-needle therapy group, Shu-needle therapy was used in combination with ozone injection of low concentration. In the acupotomy group, the conventional acupotomy therapy was applied in combination with ozone injection of low concentration. The treatment was given once every 10 days, 3 treatments made one session. After one session treatment, the clinical efficacy of two groups was observed, scores of visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were counted before and after treatment. The long-term efficacy was followed up in half a year.", "The clinical curative rate was 69.2% (45/65) and the total effective rate was 96.9% (63/65) in the Shu-needle therapy group. The curative rate was 43.1% (28/65) and the total effective rate was 84.6% (55/65) in the acupotomy group. In comparison, the efficacy of the Shu-needle therapy group was superior to that of the acupotomy group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The scores of VAS and ODI were reduced obviously after treatment as compared with those before treatment in two groups (all P < 0.05). The improvements in the Shu-needle therapy group were superior to those in the acupotomy group (both P < 0.05). In the follow-up observation, the recurrence rate in the Shu-needle therapy group was lower than that in the acupotomy group [17.8% (8/45) vs 46.4% (13/28), P < 0.05].", "Shu-needle therapy in combination with ozone injection of low concentration achieves the superior efficacy on lumbar disc herniation as compared with the acupotomy group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of TCM, Dingxi Municipal Maternal and Child Care Service Center, Dingxi 743000, Gansu Province, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yin-Chuan", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shuang-E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bao", "ForeName": "Shou-Qian", "Initials": "SQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhen Jiu", "NlmUniqueID": "8600658", "ISSNLinking": "0255-2930"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acupuncture Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lumbar Vertebrae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23227695"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
