The two potentials are coupled only when the helium isotopes are different, and the calculations reveal that this coupling is sufficient to allow the two sets of distinguishable reactants, (4)He(+) + (3)He or (3)He(+) + (4)He, to yield He(2)(+) with comparable efficiency over a wide temperature range. Consequently, the potential coupling provides a significant formation rate enhancement for the low isotopic symmetry reactants, as compared to the symmetrical cases (e.g., (4)He(+) + (4)He or (3)He(+) + (3)He). The computed symmetry-induced kinetic isotope effects (SIKIEs) are in substantial agreement with the available experimental results and represent the first theoretical demonstration of this unusual kinetic phenomenon. Possible application of SIKIE to ozone formation and other chemical systems is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, 70409-1061, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Junkai", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poirier", "ForeName": "Bill", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gellene", "ForeName": "Gregory I", "Initials": "GI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16316243", "10.1021/ja0517419"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
