The paper outlines the role of economics in the evaluation of air pollution impacts on environmental systems and describes existing research. We identify studies that address economic effects in the agricultural sector, in the commercial forest sector, and in unmanaged natural systems. Effects related to ozone exposure are highlighted. The summary of available research is followed by a discussion of research recommendations. Several short-term recommendations are identified that can augment some of the new research being considered by scientists. A more ambitious, long-term research project is outlined for valuing air pollution impacts in unmanaged natural environments. Specifically, the paper describes possible advantages of an 'integrated assessment' framework that more formally brings together the complex relationships that exist in both ecological and economic systems. A final section contains thoughts on the importance of education (i.e., information transfer) in the research process, especially in relation to policy. It is further noted that education should be inclusive of all members of the research team, throughout all stages of the research process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Oregon State University, 97331, Corvallis, OR, USA. richard.adams@oregonstate.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "Richard M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horst", "ForeName": "Robert L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Int", "NlmUniqueID": "7807270", "ISSNLinking": "0160-4120"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Forestry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Policy Making"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology Transfer"}], "NumberOfReferences": "55"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12676216", "10.1016/S0160-4120(02)00187-3", "S0160-4120(02)00187-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
