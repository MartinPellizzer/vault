Two bronchoscopes were inserted through an endotracheal tube in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, mixed breed dogs and were wedged into sublobar bronchi located in the right and left lower lobes, respectively. Segments were ventilated via the bronchoscope with 5% CO2 in air delivered at 200 ml/min, and an aerosol of 99mTc-DTPA was generated and delivered through the scope and into the sublobar segment over a 30-s period. Clearance of 99mTc-DTPA was measured simultaneously from right and left lower lung segments at baseline and 1, 7, and 14 days after a 6-h sublobar exposure to filtered air or 400 parts per billion O3. O3 treatment significantly decreased the clearance halftime (t50) of 99mTc-DTPA by 50% from the baseline mean of 32.3 to 16.0 min at 1 day postexposure. After 7 days of recovery, t50 was still reduced by 28. 8%; however, by 14 days postexposure, clearance of 99mTc-DTPA had recovered, and the t50 had a mean value of 30.0 min. 99mTc-DTPA clearance was not altered by exposure to filtered air, and t50 values were comparable to baseline at 1, 7, and 14 days postexposure. These results reveal that a single local exposure to O3 increases transepithelial clearance, but only for epithelia directly exposed to O3, and that 7-14 days of recovery are required before permeability to small-molecular-weight solutes returns to normal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology Division, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA. mfoster@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Foster", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freed", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03810", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-50579", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiopharmaceuticals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VW78417PU1", "NameOfSubstance": "Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Radiopharmaceuticals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9931202", "10.1152/jappl.1999.86.2.641"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
