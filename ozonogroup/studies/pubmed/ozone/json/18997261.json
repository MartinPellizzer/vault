After complex course of treatment positive changes have happened in regulatory systems - in indexes of cellular and humoral immunity. The treatment with using OOM enabled earlier normalization of absolute and percentage content of T-lymphocytes, removed immunodeficiency of suppressor and helper population of T-lymphocytes, decreased circulating immune complexes, amount of B-lymphocytes. The latter was accompanied by normalization or increase of the level of the separate classes of immunoglobulines. Using OOM resulted in normalization of nonspecific immunity indexes, its bactericide activity. Under the influence of complex treatment of acne disease, statistically important increase of active neutrophiles amount have been observed in comparison with data before treatment and decrease of spontaneous and stimulated indexes of nitroblue-tetrozolit test."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dermatovenerology department of the Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davatdarova", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kazimov", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Georgia (Republic)", "MedlineTA": "Georgian Med News", "NlmUniqueID": "101218222", "ISSNLinking": "1512-0112"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Acne Vulgaris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulins"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18997261"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
