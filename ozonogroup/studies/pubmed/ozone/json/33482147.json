In preclinical studies, NTP promotes blood coagulation, wound healing with disinfection, and selective killing of cancer cells. Although these biological effects of NTP have been widely explored, the stoichiometric quantitation of ROS in the liquid phase has not been performed in the presence of biocompatible reducing agents, which may modify the final biological effects of NTP. Here, we utilized electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantitate <sup>\u25cf</sup>OH, using a spin-trapping probe 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, using a fluorescent probe; and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, using luminescent probes, after NTP exposure in the presence of antioxidants. l-ascorbate (Asc) at 50\u00a0\u03bcM concentration (physiological concentration in serum) significantly scavenged <sup>\u25cf</sup>OH, whereas (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and \u03b1-tocopherol were also effective at performing scavenging activities at 250\u00a0\u03bcM concentrations. Asc significantly scavenged O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 100\u00a0\u03bcM. l-Dehydroascorbate (DHA), an oxidized form of Asc, degraded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas it did not quench <sup>\u25cf</sup>OH or O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, which are sources of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, EGCG efficiently scavenged NTP-induced <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Chelex-treated water. These results indicate that the redox cycling of Asc/DHA and metabolites of DHA are important to be considered when applying NTP to cells and tissues. Additionally, ROS-reducing compounds, such as EGCG, affect the outcome. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the interaction between ROS and biomolecules to promote the medical applications of NTP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
