Rats were divided into four groups as the following: control group, PRP, HBO and Ozone groups. 0.1\u00a0ml of PRP was injected on the wound edges of each rat in the PRP group on days 1, 3 and 7. Each rat in the ozone group was systemically injected with 2.3-3.0\u00a0ml ozone gas on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days. The wounds of the rats in the control group were not performed anything. The rats in the HBO group were placed in the HBO pressure chamber and were treated with one session (2\u00a0h for each session) of 100% oxygen each day for 7\u00a0days. Rats in all groups were killed on the 15th day and the hard palates were excised for histopathological examination. Inflammation severity, neovascularization, fibroblast proliferation, collagen density and epithelization were evaluated.", "The rate of intense wound closure (epithelialization intensity) was significantly higher in all the three treatment groups, the PRP group was the highest, than in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Fibroblast proliferation level was higher in PRP group (p\u2009<\u20090.05), followed by ozone, HBO and control groups, respectively. Histologically, inflammation was significantly higher in the control group than the treatment groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). For the treatment groups; it was lowest in the PRP group, followed by the ozone and HBO groups, respectively. The rates of angiogenesis and collagenization were significantly higher in all the three treatment groups, the PRP group was the highest, than in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In this study, no significance difference was found between the groups in terms of blood glucose levels (p\u2009=\u20090.21).", "In this study, all three treatment modalities were found to be effective in wound healing, and PRP was found to be more effective than the others."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Uslu", "ForeName": "Kemal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6599-856X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. hasandeniztansuker@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Tansuker", "ForeName": "Hasan Deniz", "Initials": "HD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Tabaru", "ForeName": "Alper", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Egeren", "ForeName": "Selim Engin", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kulahci", "ForeName": "Kemal Kutay", "Initials": "KK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical and Clinical Microbiology, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Bulut", "ForeName": "P\u0131nar", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Emre", "ForeName": "Funda", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Health Sciences Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Oktay", "ForeName": "Mehmet Faruk", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol", "NlmUniqueID": "9002937", "ISSNLinking": "0937-4477"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hyperbaric Oxygenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet-Rich Plasma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Edgar WM (1992) Saliva: its secretion, composition and functions.
