Nevertheless, our understanding about the formation processes of the compounds through reactions of indoor air oxidants with primary emitted pollutants is still incomplete. In this study we performed real-time measurements of nitrous acid (HONO), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> = NO + NO<sub>2</sub>), O<sub>3</sub>, and VOCs to investigate the contribution of human presence and human activity, e.g., mopping the floor, to secondary organic compounds. During human occupancy a significant increase was observed of 1-butene, isoprene, and <i>d</i>-limonene exhaled by the four adults in the room and an increase of methyl vinyl ketone/methacrolein, methylglyoxal, and 3-methylfuran, formed as secondary compounds through reactions of OH radicals with isoprene. Intriguingly, the level of some compounds (e.g., <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 126, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 152, dihydrocarvone, and <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 194, geranyl acetone) formed through reactions of O<sub>3</sub> with the primary compounds was higher in the presence of four adults than during the period of mopping the floor with commercial detergent. These results indicate that human presence can additionally degrade the indoor air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key
