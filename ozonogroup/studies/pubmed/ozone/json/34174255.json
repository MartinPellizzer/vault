Here, variations in foliar chemistry of two poplar clones (Populus deltoides\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0maximowiczii, Eridano, and P.\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0euramericana, I-214) under a chronic O<sub>3</sub> treatment (80\u00a0ppb, 5\u00a0h\u00a0d<sup>-1</sup> for 10 consecutive days) were investigated. The aim was to elucidate if leaf age and/or O<sub>3</sub>-sensitivity (considering Eridano and I-214 as O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive and O<sub>3</sub>-resistant, respectively) can affect suitability of poplar foliage for Chrysomela populi L. (Coleoptera Chrysomelidae), in terms of palatability. Comparing controls, only low amino acid (AA) contents were reported in Eridano [about 3- and 4-fold in mature and young leaves (ML and YL, respectively)], and all the investigated primary metabolites [i.e. water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), proteins (Prot) and AA] were higher in YL than in ML of I-214 (+23, +54 and\u00a0+\u00a020%, respectively). Ozone increased WSC only in YL of Eridano (+24%, i.e. highest values among samples; O<sub>3</sub> effects are always reported comparing O<sub>3</sub>-treated plants with the related controls). A concomitant decrease of Prot was observed in both ML and YL of Eridano, while only in YL of I-214 (-41, -45 and -51%, respectively). In addition, O<sub>3</sub> decreased AA in YL of Eridano and in ML of I-214 (-40 and -14%, respectively). Comparing plants maintained under charcoal-filtered air, total ascorbate (Asc) was lower in Eridano in both ML and YL (around -22%), and abscisic acid (ABA) was similar between clones; furthermore, higher levels of Asc were reported in YL than in ML of Eridano (+19%). Ozone increased Asc and ABA (about 2- and 3-fold, respectively) in both ML and YL of Eridano, as well as ABA in YL of I-214 (about 2-fold). Comparing leaves maintained under charcoal-filtered air, the choice feeding test showed that the 2nd instar larvae preferred YL, and the quantity of YL consumed was 9 and 4-fold higher than ML in Eridano and I-214, respectively. Comparing leaves exposed to O<sub>3</sub>-treatment, a significant feeding preference for YL disks was also observed, regardless of the clone. The no-choice feeding test showed that larval growth was slightly higher on untreated YL than on untreated ML (+19 and\u00a0+\u00a010% in Eridano and I-214, respectively). The body mass of larvae fed with O<sub>3</sub>-treated YL was also significantly higher than that of larvae fed with untreated YL (3- and 2-fold in Eridano and I-214). This study highlights that realistic O<sub>3</sub> concentrations can significantly impact the host/insect interactions, a phenomenon dependent on leaf age and O<sub>3</sub>-sensitivity of the host."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
