We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the existing evidence.", "We conducted a systematic search of three databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, from their time of inception to mid-April, 2015. Original studies of any epidemiological design were included. Data from eligible studies were extracted by two investigators. To calculate the summary effect estimates (EE), the random effects model was used with their corresponding 95% CI.", "13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Although not reaching statistical significance, all the summary effect estimates for the risk of stillbirth were systematically elevated in relation to mean prenatal exposure to NO2 per 10\u2005ppb (EE=1.066, 95% CI 0.965 to 1.178, n=3), CO per 0.4\u2005ppm (EE=1.025, 95% CI 0.985 to 1.066, n=3), SO2 per 3\u2005ppb (EE=1.022, 95% CI 0.984 to 1.062, n=3,), PM2.5 per 4\u2005\u03bcg/m(3) (EE=1.021, 95% CI 0.996 to 1.046, n=2) and PM10 per 10\u2005\u03bcg/m(3) (EE=1.014, 95% CI 0.948 to 1.085, n=2). The effect estimates for SO2, CO, PM10 and O3 were highest for the third trimester exposure. Two time series studies used a lag term of not more than 6\u2005days preceding stillbirth, and both found increased effect estimates for some pollutants.", "The body of evidence suggests that exposure to ambient air pollution increases the risk of stillbirth. Further studies are needed to strengthen the evidence."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.
