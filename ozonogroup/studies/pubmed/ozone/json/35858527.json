The reactive species (HO\u00b7, ClO\u00b7, ozone, Cl\u00b7, and Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7) in the system were identified, and the changing trends of the percentage contributions of these reactive species to IPM removal under various conditions were systematically evaluated. The results showed that ClO\u00b7 and HO\u00b7 played the most significant roles in the apparent pseudo-first-order rate constants of IPM degradation (k<sub>obs</sub>, min<sup>-1</sup>) in the control experiment, and their percentage contributions to k<sub>obs</sub> were 41.31% and 34.45%, respectively. In addition, Cl\u00b7 and Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7 together contributed 22% to the k<sub>obs</sub>. Furthermore, the contribution of ozone to the IPM removal could be neglected. The concentrations of these species increased significantly when the concentration of NaClO was increased from 50\u00a0\u00b5M to 200\u00a0\u00b5M, while the percentage contribution of ClO\u00b7 to k<sub>obs</sub> was greatly increased. The concentrations and percentage contributions of HO\u00b7 and ClO\u00b7 decreased significantly as the solution pH increased from 5 to 9, with Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7 playing a greater role in the degradation of IPM under alkaline conditions. While Cl<sup>-</sup> or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> significantly promoted the generation of Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7 or CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7, neither had an obvious effect on k<sub>obs</sub>, suggesting that Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7 and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7 should have a certain reactivity with IPM. Compared with that of Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7, the percentage contribution of ClO\u00b7 and Cl\u00b7 to k<sub>obs</sub> was more likely to be inhibited by NOM. In addition, the organic and inorganic oxidation products of IPM were detected. The oxidation mechanisms of IPM degradation in the UV<sub>365</sub>/NaClO system, such as the H-extraction reaction, deiodination, substitution reaction, amide hydrolysis, and amine oxidation, were proposed according to the obtained 15 organic products. No effect on acute toxicity towards Vibrio fischeri and Photobacterium phosphoreum was detected during the oxidation of IPM by the UV<sub>365</sub>/NaClO system. Furthermore, the engineering feasibility of the oxidation system was demonstrated, by the effective degradation of IPM in actual water. However, HOI rapidly accumulated during the removal of IPM in the UV<sub>365</sub>/NaClO system, which poses certain environmental risks and will needs to be investigated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
