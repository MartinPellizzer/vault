CCVB is spin-pure, size-consistent, and can exactly (in its active space) separate any molecule into atoms for which unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) at dissociation is the sum of the ground state UHF energies of the atoms. However CCVB is far from a complete description of strong correlations. Its first failure to exactly describe spin-recouplings arises at the level of 3 electron pairs, such as the recoupling of 3 triplet oxygen atoms in the dissociation of singlet ozone. Such situations are often associated with spin frustration. To address this limitation, an extension of CCVB, termed CCVB+i3, is reported here that includes an independent (i) amplitude approximation to the 3-pair recouplings. CCVB+i3 thereby has the same basic computational requirements as those of CCVB, which has previously been shown to be an efficient method. CCVB+i3 correctly separates molecules that CCVB cannot. As a by-product, an independent 2-pair amplitude approximation to CCVB, called PP+i2, is also defined. Remarkably, PP+i2 can also correctly separate systems that CCVB cannot. CCVB+i3 is validated on the symmetric dissociation of D<sub>3<i>h</i></sub> ozone. CCVB+i3 is then used to explore the role of 3-pair recouplings in an [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>(SCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> cluster that has been used to model the iron-sulfur core of [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] ferredoxins. Using localized PP orbitals, such recouplings are demonstrated to be large in some low-lying singlet excited states of the cluster. Significant 3 pair recoupling amplitudes include the usual triangular motif associated with spin frustration and other geometric arrangements of the 3 entangled pairs across the 4 iron centers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA and Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Small", "ForeName": "David W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA and Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000243096669"], "LastName": "Head-Gordon", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30316269", "10.1063/1.5046318"]}}]}
