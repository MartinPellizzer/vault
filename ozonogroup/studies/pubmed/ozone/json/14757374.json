Typically, these findings are based on models that assume a linear relationship between log mortality and ozone level. In this study, we adapted generalized additive models in which ozone effects are presumed to occur in three different ways: as a simple linear term, as a cubic natural spline term, and as a combination of two linear terms (a threshold model). We applied these models to daily time-series data for Seoul, Korea for the years 1995-1999 and found that the threshold model always fits best among the three. A 2.6% (95% CI: 1.7-3.5) increase of estimated relative risk (RR) in the total mortality associated with a 21.5 ppb increase of daily 1-h maximum ozone lagged by 1 day was observed by linear Poisson's regression. However, a 3.4% (95% CI: 2.3-4.4) increase in the estimated RR was observed using the threshold model. Adjustments for other ambient pollutants caused little changes to these results; 2.4-2.5% in the linear models and 3.2-3.4% in the threshold models. In addition, the largest difference in the estimated RRs of the linear and threshold models was observed in the summer: 1.9% (95% CI: 0.5-3.3) by the linear model and 3.8% (95% CI: 2.0-5.7) by the threshold model. These findings indicate that the conventional time-series Poisson regression model, which dose not take threshold into consideration, could underestimate the true risk of the ozone effect on daily mortality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon Dong, Chongro-Gu, Seoul 110-799, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sun-Young", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jong-Tae", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Yun-Chul", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Kyu-Jeong", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ho", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14757374", "10.1016/j.envres.2003.09.006", "S0013935103001737"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
