This study demonstrated that ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>, 100 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 mg-O<sub>3</sub>/mg-DOC) reduced the cytotoxicity of wastewater from 14.2 mg of pentol/L produced by ozonation to 4.3 mg of pentol/L (1 mg/L bromide, pH 7.0). The genotoxicity was also reduced from 1.65 to 0.17 \u03bcg-4-NQO/L by UV/O<sub>3</sub>. Compared with that of O<sub>3</sub> alone, adsorbable organic bromine was reduced from 25.8 to 5.3 \u03bcg/L by UV/O<sub>3</sub>, but bromate increased from 32.9 to 71.4 \u03bcg/L. The UV/O<sub>3</sub> process enhanced the removal of pre-existing precursors (highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and poly aromatic hydrocarbons), while new precursors were generated, yet the combined effect of UV/O<sub>3</sub> on precursors did not result in a significant change in toxicity. Instead, UV radiation inhibited HOBr concentration through both rapid O<sub>3</sub> decomposition to reduce HOBr production and decomposition of the formed HOBr, thus suppressing the AOBr formation. However, the hydroxyl radical-dominated pathway in UV/O<sub>3</sub> led to a significant increase of bromate. Considering both organic bromine and bromate, the UV/O<sub>3</sub> process effectively controlled both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of wastewater to mammalian cells, even though an emphasis should be also placed on managing elevated bromate. Futhermore, other end points are needed to evaluate the toxicity outcomes of the UV/O<sub>3</sub> process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610000, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Chang-Jie", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610000, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bao-Jun", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610000, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jie-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9935-8533"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemical Research, National Institute of Environmental Research, Seogu, Incheon 22689, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Min-Yong", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5132-2147"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for Urban Water Recycling and Environmental Safety, Institute of Environment and Ecology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qianyuan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8099-0996"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610000, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mammals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CHO Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetulus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38872439", "10.1021/acs.est.4c00329"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
