The average daytime concentrations were calculated for each of the 55 available Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Station (PAMS) VOCs using data from the Baltimore site. The data were sorted in descending order to highlight the important species based on concentration. The OH reactivity with VOCs was sorted in descending order to identify the important species based on the magnitude of the OH reactivity. A similar process was followed for the OH reactivity with CO. The contribution of the significant species to the weekday/weekend difference in OH reactivity was examined. The OH reactivity with C5H8 was the largest among the OH reactivity with the PAMS' VOCs and was the same on the weekday and weekend. The weekday/weekend difference in OH reactivity with VOCs was entirely due to differences in concentrations of the anthropogenic VOCs. The OH reactivity with VOCs was 11% larger on the weekday. When OH reactivity with CO was included, the OH reactivity was 13% larger on the weekday."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Applications International Corporation, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. fvukovich@raleigh.saic.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vukovich", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9159UV381P", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroxide ion"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maryland"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11288312", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464205"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
