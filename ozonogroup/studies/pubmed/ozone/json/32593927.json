The worst O<sub>3</sub> pollution is confronted over North China Plain. Ozone polluted days (with observed regionally-averaged maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations exceeding 80\u00a0ppbv) in May-July in North China increased from 35 days in year 2014 to 56 days in year 2018, and persistent O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes that lasted for 5 days or longer (OPEs5) contributed 14.3% and 66.1% to those O<sub>3</sub> polluted days in 2014 and 2018, respectively. Model simulations suggest that O<sub>3</sub> transport from central eastern China (including Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces) contributes 36% of the enhanced O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in North China during OPEs5 relative to the seasonal mean. We find that emission control of volatile organic compounds in central eastern China is most effective to alleviate intensity of OPEs5 in North China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
