Under anaesthesia, a circular full-thickness bone defect was created in all groups, and the experimental groups were further divided into two sub-groups, with 7 rats in each group sacrificed at the end of the 4th and 8th weeks. Bone samples were dissected, fixed in 10% formalin solution, and decalcified with 5% ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA). After the routine follow-up on tissues, immunostaining of osteopontin and osteonectin antibodies was applied to sections and observed under a light microscope.", "The control group exhibited osteopontin and osteonectin expression in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells at the end of the 4th week with an acceleration at the 8th week. Ozone administration elucidated new trabecular bone formation by increasing osteoblastic activity. Lastly, our observations underscore that a combination of allograft and ozone application increased the osteoblast, osteocyte, and bone matrix development at the 4th and 8th weeks.", "Exposure to an ozone application with an alloplastic bone graft on calvarial bone damage may induce osteoblastic activity, matrix development, mature bone cell formation, and new bone formation in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Katip \u00c7elebi, \u0130zmir, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "La\u00e7in", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Bing\u00f6l, Bing\u00f6l, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "\u0130zol", "ForeName": "B S", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Dicle University, Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f6kalp \u00d6zkorkmaz", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Dicle, Diyarbakir, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deveci", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Dicle University, Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey. devecie32@hotmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deveci", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Folia Morphol (Warsz)", "NlmUniqueID": "0374620", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5659"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Osteonectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "106441-73-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Osteopontin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bone Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Osteonectin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Osteopontin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skull"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31489606", "10.5603/FM.a2019.0101", "VM/OJS/J/64775"]}}]}
