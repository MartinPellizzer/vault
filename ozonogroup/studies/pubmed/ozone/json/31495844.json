Two main sets of products, (i) HBr + O3 and (ii) BrOH + O2, are formed regardless of the presence of water, following a hydrogen abstraction mechanism. The HBr + O3 products are formed from the intermediate BrOOOH adduct, whereas BrOH + O2 are formed either from the intermediate OBrOOH adduct or via a barrierless hydrogen transfer from HO2 to BrO. Owing to the formation of molecular oxygen that can bear different spin configurations, the formation of BrOH + O2 products was examined both on the singlet and the triplet surfaces. Under relevant atmospheric temperatures and pressure, the formation of products (i) is energetically and kinetically less favorable than that of products (ii). The rate coefficient at 298 K for the HBr + O3 formation was determined to be 2.00 \u00d7 10-20 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, and found to decrease by 1-2 orders of magnitude when one or both reactants are clustered with water. For the formation of BrOH + O2, a rate coefficient of 2.21 \u00d7 10-11 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 is determined on both singlet and triplet surfaces in the absence of water. Though this rate coefficient slightly decreases for the hydrated reactions, the fractions of the reactants that are effectively complexed with water are not high enough to shift the overall BrOH + O2 formation rate. The current study further indicates that humidity plays a negligible role in ozone removal via the BrO + HO2 reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Shandong University, Binhai Road 72, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsona", "ForeName": "Narcisse T", "Initials": "NT", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31495844", "10.1039/c9cp03612a"]}}]}
