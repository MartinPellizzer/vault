The complex isolated in a Ne matrix yields trimethylamine-<i>N</i>-oxide (TMAO) upon irradiation (\u03bb \u2265 800 nm) by dissociation of O<sub>3</sub>. When the wavelength of radiation is changed to \u03bb = 455 nm, two stable conformers of dimethylaminomethanol (DMAM) are recognized besides TMAO. In an Ar matrix, DMAM and not TMAO is mainly produced upon \u03bb = 455 nm irradiation. The photoreaction mechanism of the O<sub>3</sub>-TMA complex with a single collision reaction between O(<sup>3</sup>P) and TMA in the gas phase to produce OH and CH<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> radicals is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kamata", "ForeName": "Kentaro", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yoshioka", "ForeName": "Rengo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5722-4596"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Akai", "ForeName": "Nobuyuki", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakata", "ForeName": "Munetaka", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33226237", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c08965"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
