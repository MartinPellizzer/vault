Hence, an international agreement has recently been reached calling for its reduced consumption and complete phasing out. This present research evaluates the potential of Ecologic, a biological, marine shell meal chitin material, as a soil amendment management agent for root knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, control, and its effect on the growth of Floradel tomato plant, Lycopersicon esculentum. To accomplish this goal, studies were conducted during which, experimental pots were set up in greenhouse environments using sterilized soil inoculated with 5,000 root-knot eggs per 1500 g soil. There were 4 treatments and 5 replications. Treatments were: No chitin; 50 g chitin; 100 g chitin; and 200 g chitin. A two-week wait period following Ecologic amendment preceded Floradel tomato planting to allow breakdown of the chitin material into the soil. Fresh and dry weights of shoot and root materials were taken as growth end-points. A statistically significant difference (p < or = 0.05) was obtained with regard to the growth rate of L. esculentum at 100 g chitin treatment compared to the control with no chitin. Mean fresh weights of Floradel tomato were 78.0 +/- 22.3 g, 81.0 +/- 20.3 g, 109.0 +/- 25.4 g and 102.0 +/- 33.3 g at 0, 50, 100 and 200 g chitin, respectively. The analysis of root knot nematode concentrations indicated a substantial effect on reproduction rate associated with chitin amendment. Study results showed a significant decrease in both root knot nematode eggs and juveniles (J2) at 100g and 200 g Ecologic chitin levels, however, an increase in nematode concentrations was recorded at the 50 g Ecologic chitin level (p < or = 0.05). The mean amounts of J2 population, as expressed per 1500 cm3 soil, were 49,933 +/- 38,819, 86,050 +/- 25248, 103 +/- 133 and 103 +/- 133 for 0, 50, 100 and 200 g chitin, respectively. Similarly, the mean numbers of root knot nematode eggs (per 1500 cm3 of soil) were 40,759 +/- 36,712, 66,048 +/- 39,730, 9,904 +/- 16,591 and 9,257 +/- 17,204. Root gall rating was also significantly lower (p < or = 0.05) at the 100 g and 200 g chitin levels compared to the control. Percent gall ratings were 3.3 +/- 1.0%, 3.2 +/- 1.0%, 1.0 +/- 0.5%, and 1.0% +/- 0.6% for amendment levels of 0, 50, 100, and 200 g chitin, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Toxicology Research Laboratory, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi 39217, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ladner", "ForeName": "Debora C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tchounwou", "ForeName": "Paul B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawrence", "ForeName": "Gary W", "Initials": "GW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101238455", "ISSNLinking": "1660-4601"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antinematodal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1398-61-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antinematodal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chitin"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Shellfish"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Tylenchoidea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Dropkin H.
