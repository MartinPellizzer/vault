The catalysts were prepared by a wet impregnation method that gave manganese supported on various commercial sources of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The properties of the catalysts were studied using physicochemical techniques, including Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H<sub>2</sub> temperature-programmed reduction (H<sub>2</sub>-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The O<sub>3</sub> decomposition tests of Mn-Ti catalysts with various manganese loadings revealed that the 10 wt% manganese catalyst exhibited optimal, excellent activity. The O<sub>3</sub> conversion and Mn valence state of the Mn-Ti catalysts were different, depending on the structure of the TiO<sub>2</sub> source. Increasing the O/Ti surface atomic ratio in TiO<sub>2</sub> increased the Mn<sup>3+</sup> ratio. The Mn<sup>3+</sup> ratio directly affected the O<sub>3</sub> decomposition activity of the Mn-Ti catalyst. When the Mn<sup>3+</sup> ratio was the largest, the catalyst showed the highest activity in O<sub>3</sub> decomposition. The valence state of Mn exposed to the surface was a critical factor in O<sub>3</sub> decomposition by Mn-Ti catalysts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Energy Engineering , Graduate School of Kyonggi University , Youngtong-ku, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Dong Wook", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Energy Engineering , Graduate School of Kyonggi University , Youngtong-ku, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Geo Jong", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Energy Engineering , Graduate School of Kyonggi University , Youngtong-ku, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Won", "ForeName": "Jong Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Energy Engineering , Graduate School of Kyonggi University , Youngtong-ku, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Sung Chang", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28042743", "10.1080/09593330.2016.1278274"]}}]}
