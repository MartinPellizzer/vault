Hence FO3 model accuracy will strongly depend on the gst model being implemented. In this study the recently developed semi-empirical Gst model of Dewar was coupled to the widely known biochemical photosynthesis ( An) model of Farquhar. The Gst performance of this model combination was evaluated with a 4-month time series of beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.) measurements. The Gst model was hereto optimized in two steps to a 4-day and a 8-day period. A comparison between the modelled and measured gst to O(3) (gstO3) revealed a rather good overall performance (R(2)=0.77). Errors between the model combination and the measurements are thought to be largely caused by a moderate performance of the AN model, due to poor parameterization. Two 2-day periods with distinctly differing soil and meteorological conditions were chosen to give a picture of the daily gst performance. Although instant relative differences between modelled and measured gstO3 are sometimes high, the model combination is able to simulate the rough daily courses of gstO3 and hence FO3 reasonably well. Further improvement on full parameterization of the gst model and a well-parameterized An model to be linked to are needed to draw founded conclusions about its performance. Future efforts hereto are certainly justified since the model's mechanistic nature makes it a tool able to model gst variation in space and time, O(3) effects on gst, and effective FO3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group Plant and Vegetation Ecology, University of Antwerpen UA (CDE), Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium. maarten.opdebeeck@ua.ac.be"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Op de Beeck", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f6w", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verbeeck", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deckmyn", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17357025", "10.1055/s-2006-924635"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
