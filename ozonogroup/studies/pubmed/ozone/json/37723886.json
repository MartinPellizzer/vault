Its impact on lipid oxidation was investigated in this study. Stripped methylesters were considered as a basic lipid model system and were treated by a multihollow surface dielectric barrier discharge. In dry air plasma, O<sub>3</sub>, <sup>\u00b7</sup>NO<sub>2</sub>, <sup>\u00b7</sup>NO<sub>3</sub>, and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> were identified as the main reactive species reaching the sample surface. Treatment time was the most prominent parameter affecting lipid oxidation, followed by the (specific) power input and the plasma-sample distance. In humid air plasma, less O<sub>3</sub> was detected, but ONOOH and O<sub>2</sub>NOOH were generated and presumed to play a role in lipid oxidation. Ozone mainly resulted in the formation of carbonyl substances via the trioxolane pathway, while reactive nitrogen species (i.e., <sup>\u00b7</sup>NO<sub>2</sub>, <sup>\u00b7</sup>NO<sub>3</sub>, ONOOH, and O<sub>2</sub>NOOH) led to the formation of hydroperoxides. The impact of short-living radicals (e.g., <sup>\u00b7</sup>O, <sup>\u00b7</sup>N, <sup>\u00b7</sup>OH, and <sup>\u00b7</sup>OOH) was restricted in general, since they dissipated too fast to reach the sample.<sup>\u00b7</sup>NO, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and UV radiation did not induce lipid oxidation. All the reactive species identified in this study were associated with the presence of O<sub>2</sub> in the input gas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6300-3044"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Danyang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0026-2564"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Van Paepeghem", "ForeName": "Charlie", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Sierens", "ForeName": "Joke", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Unit Plasma Technology (RUPT), Department of Applied Physics, Ghent University, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Narimisa", "ForeName": "Mehrnoush", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2255-6419"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Unit Plasma Technology (RUPT), Department of Applied Physics, Ghent University, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Nikiforov", "ForeName": "Anton", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Unit Plasma Technology (RUPT), Department of Applied Physics, Ghent University, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "De Geyter", "ForeName": "Nathalie", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3514-6045"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group EnVOC, Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Demeestere", "ForeName": "Kristof", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0121-5567"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Group NutriFOODchem, Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "De Meulenaer", "ForeName": "Bruno", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37723886", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c03706"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
