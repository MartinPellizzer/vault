Based on calculations of clear-sky UV irradiances, the effects of the Montreal Protocol have been hugely beneficial to avoid the health risks, such as skin cancer, which are associated with high UV, while there is only a small increase in health risks, such as vitamin D deficiency, that are associated with low UV. However, interactions with climate change may lead to changes in cloud and albedo, and possibly behavioural changes that could also be important."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newman", "ForeName": "Paul A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKenzie", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101124451", "ISSNLinking": "1474-905X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21455537", "10.1039/c0pp00387e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
