Ozonation is able to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents. However, during that reaction, ozonation products are formed. Some ozonation products were found to be persistent and have adverse effect on the environment. Moving bed bio reactors (MBBRs) were tested for the removal of the ozonation products of macrolide antibiotics and diclofenac at two different concentration levels 1\u202f\u03bcg/L and 10\u202f\u03bcg/L in laboratory reactors. It was found that the MBBRs are capable of degrading these compounds without back-transformation into the parent compounds. However, reaction rate constants and the degradation kinetics varied for different compounds and different concentrations. Depending on compound and conditions, the degradation reaction kinetics was found to follow either i) zero order ii) first order or iii) lag phase succeeded by first order. The study has proven that MBBRs have the potential to be efficient in polishing post ozonation treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
