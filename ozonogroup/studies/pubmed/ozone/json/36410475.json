However, eight nocturnal O<sub>3</sub> increase (NOI) events were identified in Nanjing in June 2021. To understand the mechanism of NOI events, we selected two events (June 6-7, and 24-25) for observational data analysis. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was employed for the process analysis (PA) and regional transport of O<sub>3</sub>. By analyzing the O<sub>3</sub> observation data and meteorological factors, we found that there were clear southeastward O<sub>3</sub> transport paths. The O<sub>3</sub> peak clearly moved from the upwind to the downwind cities in both events. Model simulations showed that when nocturnal O<sub>3</sub> enhancement occurred, horizontal transport resulted in a negative to positive net O<sub>3</sub> production rate. O<sub>3</sub> continued to get accumulated in Nanjing. Nocturnal O<sub>3</sub> in the first event was dominated by long-range transport, with the top two contributing cities being Huzhou (5.6 %) and Jiaxing (4.7 %). NOI during the second event was from the nearby upwind cities. The top three contributing cities were Shanghai (18.3 %), Wuxi (9.1 %), and Suzhou (8.8 %). We conclude that the June NOI events in Nanjing were mainly driven by the horizontal transport of southeasterly winds. This study provides scientific support for O<sub>3</sub> prevention and control in Nanjing in the summer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
