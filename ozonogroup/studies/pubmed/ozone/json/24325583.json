The main constituents are hydrogen tetroxide H2O4, trioxide H2O3, and peroxide H2O2 in comparable amounts and also water H2O. The mechanism and quantitative kinetic model of their formation have been proposed. H2O4, H2O3, and H2O2 are formed in the diffusion-controlled reactions between OH and HO2 in the liquid ozone layer and stabilized by transfer to the solid phase. OH and HO2 radicals are generated via a sequence of the reactions initiated by the interaction H + O3(liq). The model adequately reproduces the properties of the real condensates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, M.V.
