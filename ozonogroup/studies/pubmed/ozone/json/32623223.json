This work aims to evaluate the health and associated economic impacts of changes in air quality induced by heat wave, stagnation, and compound extremes under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition is applied to estimate health and related economic impacts of changes in surface O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels due to heat wave, stagnation, and compound extremes over the continental U.S. during past (i.e., 2001-2010) and future (i.e., 2046-2055) decades under the two RCP scenarios. Under the past and future decades, the weather extremes-induced concentration increases may lead to several tens to hundreds O<sub>3</sub>-related deaths and several hundreds to over ten thousands PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related deaths annually. High mortalities and morbidities are estimated for populated urban areas with strong spatial heterogeneities. The estimated annual costs for these O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> related health outcomes are $5.5-12.5 and $48.6-140.7 billion U.S. dollar for mortalities, and $8.9-97.8 and $19.5-112.5 million for morbidities, respectively. Of the extreme events, the estimated O<sub>3</sub>- and PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related mortality and morbidity attributed to stagnation are the highest, followed by heat wave or compound extremes. Large increases in heat wave and compound extreme events in the future decade dominate changes in mortality during these two extreme events, whereas population growth dominates changes in mortality during stagnation that is projected to occur less frequently. Projected reductions of anthropogenic emissions under bothRCP scenarios compensate for the increased mortality due to increasedoccurrence for heat wave and compound extremes in the future. These results suggest a need to further reduce air pollutant emissions during weather extremes to minimize the adverse impacts of weather extremes on air quality and human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
