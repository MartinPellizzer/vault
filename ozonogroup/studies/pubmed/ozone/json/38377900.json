However, the trade-off between the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dosage required for minimization of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation and effective pollutant removal has not been clearly delineated. In this study, employing experimental investigations as well as chemical modelling, we show that the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> required to achieve maximum pollutant removal may not be the same as that required for minimization of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation. At the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dosage required to minimize BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation (<10\u00a0\u00b5g/L), only pollutants with high to moderate reactivity towards O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH are effectively removed. For pollutants with low reactivity towards O<sub>3</sub>/<sup>\u2022</sup>OH, high O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>:DOC>>1\u00a0g/g) and high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dosages (O<sub>3</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> \u223c1 (g/g)) are required for minimizing BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation along with effective pollutant removal which may result in a very high residual of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the effluent, causing secondary pollution. On balance, we conclude that the peroxone process is not effective for the removal of low reactivity micropollutants if minimization of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation is also required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
