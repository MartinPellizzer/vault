Many of these ozonation products (OPs) are biodegradable and thus removed by post-treatment (e.g., aldehydes). Most studies on OPs of TrOCs in wastewater rely on reversed-phase liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS), which is not suited for highly polar analytes. In this study, supercritical fluid chromatography combined with high resolution MS (SFC-HRMS) was applied in comparison to the generic RPLC-HRMS to search for OPs in ozonated wastewater treatment plant effluent at pilot-scale. While comparable results were obtained from these two techniques during suspect screenings for known OPs, a total of 23 OPs were only observed by SFC-HRMS via non-targeted screening. Several SFC-only OPs were proposed as the derivatives of methoxymethylmelamines, phenolic sulfates/sulfonates, and metformin; the latter was confirmed by laboratory-scale ozonation experiments. A complete ozonation pathway of metformin, a widespread and extremely hydrophilic TrOC in aquatic environment, was elaborated based on SFC-HRMS analysis. Five of the 10 metformin OPs are reported for the first time in this study. Three different dual-media filters were compared as post-treatments, and a combination of sand/anthracite and fresh post-granular activated carbon proved most effective in OPs removal due to the additional adsorption capacity. However, six SFC-only OPs, two of which originating from metformin, appeared to be persistent during all post-treatments, raising concerns on their occurrence in drinking water sources impacted by wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
