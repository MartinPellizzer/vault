Avoidance of ozone stress may be explained by decreased stomatal conductance during ozone exposure because stomata are the principal interface for entry of ozone into plants. In this study, a coupled photosynthesis-stomatal model was modified to test whether the presence of ozone can induce avoidance of ozone stress by stomatal closure.", "The response of Siebold's beech (Fagus crenata), a representative deciduous tree species, to ozone was studied in a free-air ozone exposure experiment in Japan. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were measured under ambient and elevated ozone. An optimization model of stomata involving water, CO2 and ozone flux was tested using the leaf gas exchange data.", "The data suggest that there are two phases in the avoidance of ozone stress via stomatal closure for Siebold's beech: (1) in early summer ozone influx is efficiently limited by a reduction in stomatal conductance, without any clear effect on photosynthetic capacity; and (2) in late summer and autumn the efficiency of ozone stress avoidance was decreased because the decrease in stomatal conductance was small and accompanied by an ozone-induced decline of photosynthetic capacity.", "Ozone-induced stomatal closure in Siebold's beech during early summer reduces ozone influx and allows the maximum photosynthetic capacity to be reached, but is not sufficient in older leaves to protect the photosynthetic system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Silviculture and Forest Ecological Studies, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8689, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoshika", "ForeName": "Yasutomo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Makoto", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inada", "ForeName": "Naoki", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koike", "ForeName": "Takayoshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0372347", "ISSNLinking": "0305-7364"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Akimoto H.
