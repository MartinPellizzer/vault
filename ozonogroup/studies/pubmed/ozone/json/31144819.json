In this study, we use surface potential analyses to record and optimize the gas-phase deposition of APTES self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and to determine the resulting change of the electrokinetic potential and charge at the solid?liquid interface when the system is exposed to an electrolyte. Using a gas-phase molecular layer deposition setup with an in situ molecule deposition sensor, APTES is deposited at room temperature onto ozone-activated SiO<sub>2</sub>. The resulting layers are characterized using various techniques ranging from contact angle analysis, ellipsometry, fluorescence microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrokinetic analysis to AFM. It turns out that adequate postdeposition treatment is crucial to the formation of perfect molecular SAMs. We demonstrate how a thick layer of APTES molecules is initially adsorbed at the surface; however, the molecules do not bind to SiO<sub>2</sub> and are removed if the film is exposed to an electrolyte. Only if the film is kept in a gaseous environment (preferable at low pressure) for a long enough time do APTES molecules start to bind to the surface and form the SAM layer. During this time, superfluous molecules are removed. The resulting modification of the electrokinetic potential at the surface is analyzed in detail for different states."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Complex Systems?Bioelectronics (ICS-8) , Forschungszentrum Ju?lich , Ju?lich 52428 , Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7302-7816"], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xiaobo", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Complex Systems?Bioelectronics (ICS-8) , Forschungszentrum Ju?lich , Ju?lich 52428 , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "Nikolaus", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Complex Systems?Bioelectronics (ICS-8) , Forschungszentrum Ju?lich , Ju?lich 52428 , Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1296-8265"], "LastName": "Mayer", "ForeName": "Dirk", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Complex Systems?Bioelectronics (ICS-8) , Forschungszentrum Ju?lich , Ju?lich 52428 , Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6143-2702"], "LastName": "Offenha Usser", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Complex Systems?Bioelectronics (ICS-8) , Forschungszentrum Ju?lich , Ju?lich 52428 , Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1898-0751"], "LastName": "Wo Rdenweber", "ForeName": "Roger", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31144819", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b03832"]}}]}
