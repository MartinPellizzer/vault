The objectives were to: (1) identify various compounds in wastewater from a pulp and paper mill, (2) evaluate decolorization and organic removal efficiency by conventional bubble reactor and (3) evaluate the biodegradability at various progressive stages of ozonation. The qualitative GC/MS analyses were performed before and after the biological treatment and ozonation process. Two groups of compounds were observed in this wastewater: lignin-derived compounds and aliphatic compounds used in the pulp and paper production process (i.e. n-alkanes, fatty alcohols, fatty acid and ester). Treatment efficiency was measured by decolorization and TOC removal rates. Additionally, the utilization coefficient (k) and BOD/COD ratio were determined to observe the biodegradability of ozonized effluents. The results indicated that after 45 min, the ozonation of effluents yielded almost colorless effluent with over 90% decolorization efficiency and with corresponding ozone capacity rate of 20.0 mg O(3)L(-1). This decolorization was not always accompanied by the mineralization of the organic matters therefore ozonation was not related to TOC removal rates. The BOD/COD ratio increased from 0.10 to a maximum value of 0.32 with ozone flow rate (O/F) of 4.0 L min(-1). It was confirmed by the utilization coefficient as first order BOD equation, the magnitude k value increased from 0.21 day(-1) to maximum value of 0.47 day(-1) as the ozonation time was raised to 60 min with O/F 4.0 L min(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, 50 Phaholyothin Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900, Thailand. g4685023@ku.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kreetachat", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Damrongsri", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Punsuwon", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vaithanomsat", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiemchaisri", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chomsurin", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16971041", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.08.011", "S0304-3894(06)00940-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
