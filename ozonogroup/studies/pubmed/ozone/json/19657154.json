Efficiency of ozonation was determined for two leachates, different in age, composition and toxicity. We have studied the impact of ozonation time on removal of organics. The efficiency of treatment was monitored by COD, BOD(5) and DOC analyses, removal of nitrogen compounds, as well as changes in toxicity. Therefore, acute toxicity tests with luminiscent bacteria Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna and nitrifying organisms of activated sludge (ammonium oxidation) were performed prior and after ozonation experiments. It has been confirmed that longer time of ozonation does not bring significantly better results regarding treatment of young leachate (36% in 20 minutes, 42% in 120 minutes). Two steps kinetics observed resulted in minor detoxification regarding luminiscent bacteria and no changes in effects to daphnids. More effective was ozonation of the stabilized leachate. Removal of COD reached 50% in 80 minutes and 65% in 120 minutes. Detoxification was also observed. Presented research confirmed, that ozonation itself was not effective treatment methods for investigated types of leachates for reduction of their hazardous impacts to meet regulatory effluent limits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ljubljana, Askerceva 5, Ljubljana SI-1000, Slovenia. andreja.zgajnar@ki.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zgajnar Gotvajn", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derco", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tisler", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cotman", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zagorc-Koncan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19657154", "10.2166/wst.2009.400"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
