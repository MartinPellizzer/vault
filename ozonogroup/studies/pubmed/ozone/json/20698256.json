The results indicated that the whole process of O3 inactivating Giardia could be divided into two periods, the inactivated rate in log phase was significantly faster than it in the slow phase [k1 = (5.64 +/- 0.023) x 10(-1) mg x min, k2 = (2.72 +/- 0.002) x 10(-2) mg x min, k1 >> k2]. When the turbidity was 0.1 to 20. 0NTU, temperature was 5 to 35 degrees C, pH was 6.0 to 9.0, HA content was 0.5 to 10.0 mg/L, the turbidity was lower, the higher inactivating ratio could be received. With the increasing of temperature, the inactivating effect was decreased. The ability of O3 inactivating Giardia was stronger under acidic condition than it was in alkali circumstance. When the reaction system contained higher concentration of organics, the competition reaction might take place between Giardia and organics with O3, which might reduce inactivation ratio. The sequence of affecting disinfectant ability of O3 was NO3- > None > SO4(2-) > HCO3-, while inorganic cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cu2+) promoted the inactive reaction to a certain extent. If the CT value of O3 was more than 15.0 min x mg/L, the ratio of inactivation could exceed 99.0% during disinfecting drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal & Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zhilinran@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ran", "ForeName": "Zhi-Lin", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shao-Feng", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jun-Li", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yi-Xing", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Chong-Wei", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Giardia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20698256"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
