In this work, we demonstrate the direct detection of the HO<sub>2</sub> radical using an iodide-based chemical ionization mass spectrometer (iodide-CIMS). Expanding on the previously established correlation between molecule-iodide binding enthalpy and iodide-CIMS instrument sensitivity, the experimental detection of the HO<sub>2</sub> radical was preceded by the quantum chemical calculation of the HO<sub>2</sub>*I<sup>-</sup> cluster (PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP level), which showed a reasonably strong binding enthalpy of 21.60 kcal/mol. Cyclohexene ozonolysis intermediates and closed-shell products were next detected by the iodide-CIMS. The ozone-initiated cyclohexene oxidation mechanism was perturbed by the introduction of the HO<sub>2</sub> radical, leading to the formation of closed-shell hydroperoxides. The experimental investigation once again followed the initial computational molecule-iodide binding enthalpy calculations. The quantum chemical calculations were performed at the PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP level for radicals and DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP//PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP level for the closed-shell products. A comparison between the iodide-CIMS and nitrate-CIMS spectra with identical measurement steps revealed that the iodide-CIMS was able to detect the low-oxidized (O/C ratio 0.5 and 0.66) cyclohexene ozonolysis monomer products more efficiently than nitrate-CIMS. Higher-oxidized monomers (O/C ratio 1 to 1.5) were detected equally well by both methods. An investigation of dimers showed that both iodide- and nitrate-CIMS were able to detect the dimer compositions possibly formed from reactions between the peroxy radical monomers considered in this study. Additionally, iodide-CIMS detected organic ions that were formed by a previously suggested mechanism of dehydroxylation of peroxy acids (and deoxygenation of acyl peroxy radicals) by H<sub>2</sub>O*I<sup>-</sup> clusters. These mechanisms were computationally verified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5989-609X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, and \u2021Department of Physics, University of Helsinki , Helsinki, 00100, Finland."}], "LastName": "Iyer", "ForeName": "Siddharth", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, and \u2021Department of Physics, University of Helsinki , Helsinki, 00100, Finland."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xucheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6025-5959"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, and \u2021Department of Physics, University of Helsinki , Helsinki, 00100, Finland."}], "LastName": "Hyttinen", "ForeName": "Noora", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, and \u2021Department of Physics, University of Helsinki , Helsinki, 00100, Finland."}], "LastName": "Kurt\u00e9n", "ForeName": "Theo", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, and \u2021Department of Physics, University of Helsinki , Helsinki, 00100, Finland."}], "LastName": "Rissanen", "ForeName": "Matti P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28796517", "10.1021/acs.jpca.7b01588"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
