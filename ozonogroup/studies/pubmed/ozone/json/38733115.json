Petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) can contain highly toxic compounds that can harm the environment. These toxic compounds can be a challenge in biological treatment technologies due to the effects of these compounds on microorganisms. These challenges can be overcome by using ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) as a standalone or as a pretreatment to the biological treatment. Ozone was used in this study to degrade the organic pollutants in the heavily contaminated PRW from a refinery in Mpumalanga province of South Africa. The objective was achieved by treating the raw PRW using ozone at different ozone treatment times (15, 30, 45, and 60\u2009min) at a fixed ozone concentration of 3.53\u2009mg/dm<sup>3</sup>. The ozone treatment was carried out in a 2-liter custom-designed plexiglass cylindrical reactor. Ozone was generated from an Eco-Lab-24 corona discharge ozone generator using clean, dry air from the Afrox air cylinder as feed. The chemical oxygen demand, gas chromatograph characterization, and pH analysis were performed on the pretreated and post-treated PRW samples to ascertain the impact of the ozone treatment. The ozone treatment was effective in reducing the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) compounds in the PRW. The 60-min ozone treatment of different BTEX pollutants in the PRW resulted in the following percentage reduction: benzene 95%, toluene 77%, m\u2009+\u2009p-xylene 70%, ethylbenzene 69%, and o-xylene 65%. This study has shown the success of using ozone in reducing the toxic BTEX compounds in a heavily contaminated PRW."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Vaal University of Technology, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Khoza", "ForeName": "Nkosinathi", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Vaal University of Technology, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Seodigeng", "ForeName": "Tumisang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Vaal University of Technology, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Banza", "ForeName": "Musamba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Material and Metallurgical Engineering, Botswana International University of Science and Technology, Palapye, Botswana."}], "LastName": "Ochieng", "ForeName": "Aoyi", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38733115", "10.1080/10934529.2024.2348417"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
