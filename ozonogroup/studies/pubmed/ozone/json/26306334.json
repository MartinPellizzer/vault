However, there are numerous knowledge gaps, including safe contact times, exposure levels, and potential long-term effects on aquaculture species in both freshwater and seawater. The effect of different ozone (O3) doses (0.5-1.0, 1.5-2.0, and 2.5-3.0 mg of O3/L for 90 s) on recently fertilized eggs of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua and eyed eggs of Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss was evaluated in comparison with the effects of two commercial disinfectants: Perosan (0.004 mg/L) and Ovadine (100 mg/L). The impact of ozone application was evaluated based on hatching success, larval nucleic acid concentration, larval growth, and survival. Overall, results indicated that ozonation of Atlantic Cod eggs at a dose less than 3.0 mg/L for 90 s produced no negative effect on the larvae up to 30 d posthatch. Furthermore, ozonation of Atlantic Salmon and Rainbow Trout eggs generated no negative effect on the larvae, based on monitoring until 85% yolk sac re-absorption (16 d posthatch)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fry", "ForeName": "Jessica", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casanova", "ForeName": "P\u00e9rez Juan", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamoutene", "ForeName": "Dounia", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lush", "ForeName": "Lynn", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walsh", "ForeName": "Andy", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Couturier", "ForeName": "Cyr", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Aquat Anim Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9884881", "ISSNLinking": "0899-7659"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Fish Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gadus morhua"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oncorhynchus mykiss"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salmo salar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26306334", "10.1080/08997659.2014.983278"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
