In particular, organic pollutants generated by many of these industries contaminate the environment leading to health and other issues. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been introduced to remove organic pollutants present in wastewater. Sonolytic degradation of organic pollutants is considered as one of the AOPs, however, this process has its limitations. In order to overcome the limitations, hybrid techniques involving ultrasound and other AOPs have been developed. That is, ultrasound combined with heterogeneous AOPs (ultrasound/metal ions, ultrasound/metal oxides, and ultrasound/photocatalysis) and homogeneous AOPs (ultrasound/ozone, ultrasound/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and ultrasound/persulfate) for the degradation/mineralization of organic pollutants. This review highlights the advantages of using hybrid techniques involving ultrasound for the degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
