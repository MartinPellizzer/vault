Considering the large contribution of O<sub>3</sub> in degrading the air quality of western Taiwan, three-year (2019-2021) hourly concentration data of VOC, NO<sub>X</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> from 4 monitoring stations of western Taiwan: Tucheng (TC), Zhongming (ZM), Taixi (TX) and Xiaogang (XG), was evaluated to identify the effect of anthropogenic emissions on O<sub>3</sub> formation. Owing to the high-ambient reactivity of VOCs on the underestimation of sources, photochemical oxidation was assessed to calculate the consumed VOC (VOC<sub>cons</sub>) which was followed by the source identification of their initial concentrations. VOC<sub>cons</sub> was observed to be highest in the summer season (16.7 and 22.7 ppbC) at north (TC and ZM) and in the autumn season (17.8 and 11.4 ppbC) in southward-located stations (TX and XG, respectively). Results showed that VOCs from solvents (25-27%) were the major source at northward stations whereas VOCs-industrial emissions (30%) dominated in south. Furthermore, machine learning (ML): eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model based de-weather analysis identified that meteorological factors favor to reduce ambient O<sub>3</sub> levels at TC, ZM and XG stations (-67%, -47% and -21%, respectively) but they have a major role in accumulating the O<sub>3</sub> (+38%) at the TX station which is primarily transported from the upwind region of south-central Taiwan. Crucial insights using ML outputs showed that the finding of the study can be utilized for region-specific data-driven control of emission from VOCs-sources and prioritized to limit the O<sub>3</sub>-pollution at the study location-ns as well as their accumulation in distant regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
