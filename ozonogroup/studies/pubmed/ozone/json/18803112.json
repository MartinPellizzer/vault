The factors that affect the degradation efficiency of diuron were examined. The generated inorganic ions and organic acids during the ozonation process were detected. Total organic carbon removal rate and the amount of the released Cl(-) increased with increasing ozonation time, but only 80.0% of the maximum theoretical concentration of Cl(-) at total mineralization was detected when initial diuron concentration was 13.8 mg L(-1). For N species, the final concentrations of NO3(-) and NH4+ after 60 min of reaction time were 0.28 and 0.19 mg L(-1), respectively. The generated acetic acid, formic acid and oxalic acid were detected during the reaction process. The main degradation pathway of diuron by ozonation involved a series of dechlorination-hydroxylation, dealkylation and oxidative opening of the aromatic ring processes, leading to small organic species and inorganic species. The degradation efficiency of diuron increased with decreasing initial diuron concentration. Higher pH value, more ozone dosage, additive Na2CO3, additive NaHCO3 and additive H2O2 were all advantageous to improve the degradation efficiency of diuron."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Jingwei", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luan", "ForeName": "Jingfei", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jibiao", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lianhong", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9I3SDS92WY", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diuron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18803112", "10.1080/10934520801893535", "902655089"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
