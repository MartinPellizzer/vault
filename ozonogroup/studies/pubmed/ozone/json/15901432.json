These are only two of the clinical problems for which ozone can, and has, been used; it has also been employed for a wide variety of other purposes in both dentistry and medicine. This pale blue-coloured gas plays an important role as a natural constituent in the higher layer of the Earth's atmosphere. There is growing evidence that it can be employed as a useful therapeutic agent. This paper reviews its therapeutic uses to date and suggests its possible future clinical applications. Consumer demands for this strong oxidant may increase as the general public becomes increasingly aware of its therapeutic capacity and the non-invasive manner in which it can be administered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, GKT, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK. aylin.baysan@kcl.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baysan", "ForeName": "Aylin", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Prim Dent Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9617339", "ISSNLinking": "1355-7610"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Denture Cleansers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Equipment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denture Cleansers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Root Caries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15901432", "10.1308/1355761053695158"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
