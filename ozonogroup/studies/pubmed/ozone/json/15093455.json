Evaluations of the upper and lower tree crowns of 18 trees revealed evidence of significant upper surface stipple, leaf reddening and premature senescence on 72% of the trees. A general survey of an additional 169 trees disclosed that 41% exhibited similar symptoms. A gradient of increasing symptoms with increasing elevation was also evident. For the most part, asymptomatic trees were observed to be situated within well-shaded coves at the lower elevations with very few symptomatic trees present in these areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savage", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Bauer", "ForeName": "M de L", "Initials": "Mde L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarado", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093455", "10.1016/s0269-7491(96)00121-2", "S0269749196001212"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
