Nevertheless, the application of ozonation is hindered by its high energy requirements and by the uncertainties regarding the formation of toxic transformation products in the process. Energy requirements of ozonation can be reduced with a pre-ozone treatment, such as a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter, that removes part of the effluent organic matter before ozonation. This study investigated a combination of BAC filtration followed by ozonation (the BO<sub>3</sub> process) to remove MPs at low ozone doses and low energy input, and focused on the formation of toxic organic and inorganic products during ozonation. Effluent from a WWTP was collected, spiked with MPs (approximately 1\u00a0\u00b5g/L) and treated with the BO<sub>3</sub> process. Different flowrates (0.25-4\u00a0L/h) and specific ozone doses (0.2-0.6\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/g TOC) were tested and MPs, ecotoxicity and bromate were analyzed. For ecotoxicity assessment, three in vivo (daphnia, algae and bacteria) and six in vitro CALUX assays (Era, GR, PAH, P53, PR, andNrf2 CALUX) were used. Results show that the combination of BAC filtration and ozonation has higher MP removal and higher ecotoxicity removal than only BAC filtration and only ozonation. The in vivo assays show a low ecotoxicity in the initial WWTP effluent samples and no clear trend with increasing ozone doses, while most of the in vitro assays show a decrease in ecotoxicity with increasing ozone dose. This suggests that for the tested bioassays, feed water and ozone doses, the overall ecotoxicity of the formed transformation products during ozonation was lower than the overall ecotoxicity of the parent compounds. In the experiments with bromide spiking, relevant formation of bromate was observed above specific ozone doses of approximately 0.4 O<sub>3</sub>/g TOC and more bromate was formed for the samples with BAC pre-treatment. This indirectly indicates the effectivity of the pre-treatment in removing organic matter and making ozone more available to react with other compounds (such as MPs, but also bromide), but also underlines the importance of controlling the ozone dose to be below the threshold to avoid formation of bromate. It was concluded that treatment of the tested WWTP effluent in the BO<sub>3</sub> process at a specific ozone dose of 0.2\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/g TOC, results in high MP removal at limited energy input while no increase in ecotoxicity, nor formation of bromate was observed under this condition. This indicates that the hybrid BO<sub>3</sub> process can be implemented to remove MPs and improve the ecological quality of this WWTP effluent with a lower energy demand than conventional MP removal processes such as standalone ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
