Wattenberg, Herman E. Daily, Barry Commoner, James T. McHugh, and Karan Singh. Sadik stated that at the current rate of growth the world's population could double in 40 years. In 1990 the total reached 5.3 billion with the addition of another 92 million people that year. At this rate the number could reach 6.25 billion by 2000, 8.5 billion by 2025, and 10-11 billion before leveling off around 2085 with 96% of this growth in the developing countries. The African rate of growth of 3-4% cancels out development programs. The present signs of environmental stress include the impairment of the ozone layer, acidification, depletion of rain forests, and erosion. According to Wattenberg the problem is not population, it is culture, what people do that makes the difference. In south Korea, Indonesia, India, China, Brazil, and Mexico there have been major decreased in fertility since the early 1960s. Free market opportunities with family planning offer the solution. Daly opined that affluence was the main environment problem. Poverty induces higher fertility and environmental degradation; the specter of the consumption level of the average Indian rising to the levels of the average Swede looms; thus the consumption of industrial countries must be reduced. Commoner declared that the demographic transition as it had occurred in developed countries explains population growth as a result of improved living conditions and reduced mortality before fertility plummets because of even higher living standards. The economies of developing countries must be strengthened to eliminate poverty whereby they can attain stable populations. Cooperation among nations, enhancement of human life and dignity, and intensified efforts to provide family planning were advocated by the others."]}], "OtherID": ["075378", "00215494"], "PMID": "12285800", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "05", "Day": "05"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0145-1189", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "16", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1990", "Season": "Jul-Aug"}}, "Title": "EPA journal", "ISOAbbreviation": "Epa J"}, "ArticleTitle": "A forum: how big is the population factor?", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "29", "EndPage": "33", "MedlinePgn": "29-33"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadik", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wattenberg", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daly", "ForeName": "H E", "Initials": "HE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Commoner", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mchugh", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Epa J", "NlmUniqueID": "9426499", "ISSNLinking": "0145-1189"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poverty"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12285800"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
