Although it has been well documented that BVOC emissions are altered in response to elevated O<sub>3</sub>, consequent effects on the carbon budget have been largely unexplored. Here, we studied the effects of elevated O<sub>3</sub> (80\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup>) on diurnal variation of BVOC emissions and gas exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> from above- and belowground parts of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and further investigated effects on the carbon budget. In spring, elevated O<sub>3</sub> decreased BVOC emissions and net photosynthesis rate (Pn) from above-ground parts of both species. As BVOC emissions have a causal relationship with dormancy recovery, O<sub>3</sub>-induced decreases in BVOC emissions indicated the inhibition of dormancy recovery. Contrary to the spring results, in summer BVOC emissions from aboveground parts were increased in response to elevated O<sub>3</sub> in both species. Decreases in Pn indicated O<sub>3</sub> stress. O<sub>3</sub>-induced monoterpene emissions from aboveground were the main volatile defense response. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> had little effect on BVOC emissions from belowground parts of either species in spring or summer. In spring, elevated O<sub>3</sub> decreased the proportion of carbon emitted as BVOCs relative to that assimilated by photosynthesis (the proportion of BVOC-C loss) at the soil-plant system levels in both species. In summer, elevated O<sub>3</sub> resulted in a net CO<sub>2</sub>-C loss at the soil-plant system level of Scots pine. During this process, O<sub>3</sub>-induced BVOC-C loss can represent a significant fraction of carbon exchange between the atmosphere and Scots pine. In Norway spruce, the effects of O<sub>3</sub> were less pronounced. The current results highlight the need for prediction of BVOC emissions and their contributions to the carbon budget in boreal forests under O<sub>3</sub> stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
