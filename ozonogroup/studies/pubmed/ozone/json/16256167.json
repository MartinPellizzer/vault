The mechanism of hydroxyl radical production by electrolysis-ozonation process was also estimated with a mathematical model. The experimental results revealed that the electrolysis-ozonation process had a synergistic effect on the degradation of 4-CBA. The advanced oxidation effect of electrolysis-ozonation was inferred from standard potentials of relevant electrochemical reactions and mathematical model analysis to be mainly attributed to ()O(3)(-) promotion of O(3) at the cathodes. An increase in electric current improved the degradation rate of 4-CBA. However, the pseudo-first order degradation rate constant reached a plateau at high electric current densities, as ()O(3)(-) promotion of O(3) at the cathodes was regulated by O(3) transport process from the bulk to the cathodes in the range exceeding an electric current density of 10 Am(-2). Accordingly, the balance of O(3) transport flux and electric current is important for the efficient operation of the electrolysis-ozonation reactor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Ryukoku University, 1-5 Yokotani, Setaooe-cho, Otsu 520-2194, Japan. naoyuji@rins.ryukoku.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kishimoto", "ForeName": "Naoyuki", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "Yukako", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuno", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oomura", "ForeName": "Tomoaki", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mizutani", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IC7888DF4L", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorobenzoic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16256167", "10.1016/j.watres.2005.09.001", "S0043-1354(05)00496-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
