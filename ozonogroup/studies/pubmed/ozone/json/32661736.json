Air samples collected in nine prefecture-level cities were analyzed using a preconcentration method coupled with GC-MS/FID. The characteristics and ozone generation potential (OFP) of VOCs were analyzed. The relationship between air quality index (AQI) and VOCs and gross domestic product (GDP) and VOCs were also discussed, respectively. The results show that the characteristics of VOCs in cities are highly related to their industrial structure and GDP. Generally, areas with high AQI values are accompanied by high VOC concentrations. Alkanes and halocarbons were the most abundant VOCs in the atmospheric environment in the nine prefecture-level cities, accounting for 24.5~61.6% and 15.6~23.6% of total VOC concentration, respectively. The MIR method was used to analyze the OFP, and olefins contributed the most to ozone formation. Among the nine cities located in Sichuan, Dazhou was found to be the city with the highest OFP value (1191.49\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
