As an immediate measuring or a quantitative statement about the influence on cilia in vivo at human beings is extremely difficult and problematic, a convenient model experimental system in form of the so called ciliate mobility test (CMT) has been used. In this connection the influence on cilia of the protozan single-celled organism Tetrahymena pyriformis, regarding its average speed of locomotion has been taken as standard. The proof, that the cilia are identical in morphological and functional respect at the human ciliated epithelium and at T. pyriformis has been reached by electron optical comparative representation and bibliographical known substances, influencing cilia (theophylline, bromhexine, ambroxol, terpin hydrate, mercaptoethanesulfonat-sodium, amrinon, salbutamol, tetracosactid-hexaacetate, histamine, and phenol). With regard to the comparability and applicability to the human respiratory ciliated epithelium we have been able to gain statements by means of the CMT. By constructing a special reaction vessel the influence of harmful gases at a thin layer of ciliate culture suspension (1 cm) for a standardised exposure time (1 hour) has been made possible and with that a model for the comparability with the conditions of the human respiratory ciliated epithelium has been created. A number of harmful gases, that are relevant in the air hygiene (CO, CO2, N2, N2O, NO2, O3, SO2) as well as cigarette smoke at active smokers (primary stream smoke) and the inhalation of the smoke of other people's cigarettes has been tested. It turned out, that especially NO2 (nitric oxide) shows a high ciliar toxicity, while the controversially discussed ozone (O3) has not resulted in detraction of cilia. CO, N2O and SO2 have been--to a great extent--harmless on cilia in the concentration range relevant in the air hygiene. Remarkable are the results, that cigarette smoke shows clear toxic effects on cilia both at active smoking, as well as the inhalation of the smoke of other people's cigarettes. With that another contribution to the discussion about the harmfulness of active smoking and the inhalation of the smoke of other people's cigarettes is made."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Hygiene, University Erlangen-Nuremberg."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gr\u00e4f", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gr\u00e4f", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wenz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Zentralbl Hyg Umweltmed", "NlmUniqueID": "8912563", "ISSNLinking": "0934-8859"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cilia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrahymena pyriformis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10084202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
