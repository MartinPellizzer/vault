Bronchitic symptoms (bronchitis, cough, or phlegm in last 12 months) were ascertained via questionnaire in adulthood. Associations between mean air pollution exposure across childhood and self-reported adult bronchitic symptoms were estimated using logistic regression. We further adjusted for childhood bronchitic symptoms and asthma to understand whether associations operated beyond childhood respiratory health impacts. Effect modification was assessed for family history of asthma, childhood asthma, and adult allergies.", "1308 participants were included (mostly non-Hispanic White [56%] or Hispanic [32%]). At adult assessment (age mean=32.0 years, standard deviation [SD]=4.7) 25% reported bronchitic symptoms. Adult bronchitic symptoms were associated with NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> childhood exposures. Odds ratios per SD increase: 1.69 (95%CI:1.14,2.49) for NO<sub>2</sub> (SD=11.1ppb); 1.51 (95%CI:1.00,2.27) for PM<sub>10</sub> (SD=14.2\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>). Adjusting for childhood bronchitic symptoms or asthma produced similar results. NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> associations were modified by childhood asthma, with larger associations among asthmatics.", "Childhood NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> exposures were associated with adult bronchitic symptoms.
