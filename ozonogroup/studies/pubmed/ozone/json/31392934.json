In this study, highly active nano-Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> was synthesized and firstly applied in catalytic ozonation system for simultaneous removal of metronidazole (MNZ) and heavy metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>). The results showed that the synthesized Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles exhibited high efficiencies of removing both MNZ and heavy metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>) in the catalytic ozonation process. Surprisingly, the removal efficiency of MNZ in the catalytic ozonation system with nano-Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> catalyst was improved in the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Some parameters such as catalyst dosage, initial concentration of MNZ, initial concentration of heavy metal and reaction temperature could affect the simultaneous removal of MNZ and heavy metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>). This study provides an innovative and effective method for the simultaneous removal of antibiotics and heavy metals from the aquatic environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environment, Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environment, Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Guangcan", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ludong University, Yantai, Shandong, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes and Ecological Remediation, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research (YIC), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Yantai, Shandong, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes, YICCAS, Yantai, Shandong, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ludong University, Yantai, Shandong, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhenhua", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140QMO216E", "NameOfSubstance": "Metronidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NBZ3QY004S", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium Hydroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metronidazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31392934", "10.1080/09593330.2019.1648560"]}}]}
