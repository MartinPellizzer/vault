Magnesium substituted zinc in wurtzite structure and the Zn-O-Mg bond was formed in Mg-doped ZnO on the basis of the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The removal efficiencies of isoniazid were enhanced in Mg-doped ZnO catalytic ozonation processes (57.7% by 0.05-MgZnO and 76.3% by 0.10-MgZnO in 9\u202fmin), compared with ozonation alone (50.5%) and ZnO catalytic ozonation (49.5%). The removal efficiencies of total organic carbon (TOC) were also improved in Mg-doped ZnO catalytic ozonation processes. When the initial pH of 7.2 was lower than the pH<sub>PZC</sub> (point of zero charge) of Mg-doped ZnO, surface hydroxyl groups of the catalysts were protonated and the solution pH gradually increased during Mg-doped ZnO catalytic ozonation. The increase in the solution pH value mainly induced ozone decomposition into superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>). Furthermore, protonated surface hydroxyl groups (S-OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) on Mg-doped ZnO also contributed a little to ozone decomposition. The 0.10-MgZnO powder showed high stability after continuous use in the process. Additionally, we proposed a possible degradation pathway for the oxidation of isoniazid in Mg-doped ZnO catalytic ozonation on the basis of intermediates detected.
