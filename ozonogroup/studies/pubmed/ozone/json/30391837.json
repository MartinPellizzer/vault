We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and PD, given the nature of disease etiology. A total of 10 studies were identified by searching Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed before October 2017. We found a significantly increased risk of PD with 10 parts per billion (ppb) increase in nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) exposure (relative risk (RR)\u202f=\u202f1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.09). The pooled RR for the association between carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, 1\u00a0parts per million (ppm) increment, and the risk of PD was 1.65 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.48). The pooled RRs for the association between nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure per 1 ppb increment, and the risk of PD were 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.03) and 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02), respectively. There was a significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis for fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), NO<sub>2</sub>, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and CO. We concluded that NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and O<sub>3</sub> exposure were associated with an increased risk of PD, although there is high risk of bias. The dose-response effects evaluated by high-quality studies are needed. Researches should be expanded to low- and/or middle- income countries where indoor and outdoor air pollution are high. CAPSULE: Long-term exposure to ambient NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and O<sub>3</sub> can increase the risk of Parkinson's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
