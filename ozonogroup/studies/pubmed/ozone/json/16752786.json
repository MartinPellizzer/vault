An ozone treatment in the presence of ionic manganese, a catalyst, increased the sludge reduction ratio three times higher than that of a single ozonation, presumably due to an increase in OH radical production. The ozone treatment yielded the effective sludge reduction ratio with an increasing ozone dosage, and an effective dosage of the catalyst was found to be 4 mg-Mn/g-TS. When a mechanical pretreatment and an ozone/catalyst were applied in a series, the integrated process, even at a half mechanical intensity and a half level of ozone dosage, showed higher and faster sludge reduction than each single process did. In addition, the integrated pretreatment process showed the highest dewaterability of the treated sludges. A ratio of sludge cake generation, which was newly introduced to quantify overall performance of sludge treatment processes, showed that the integrated pretreatment followed by the aerobic digestion yielded approximately a half of the sludge cake volume compared to the single aerobic digestion. Therefore, the integrated pretreatment can be a feasible method for the effective reduction of total suspended solid and the final volume."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Applied Chemistry, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Korea. sjhwang@khu.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16752786", "10.2166/wst.2006.228"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
