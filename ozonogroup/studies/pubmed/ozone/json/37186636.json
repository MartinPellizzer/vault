In this paper, the effect of ozonation application in the treatment of copper mineral processing wastewater, which is difficult to be effectively treated by traditional processes due to its complex composition, was investigated. The effects of ozonation time, ozone concentration, temperature and pH on the degradation of organic compounds in the wastewater by ozonation were researched. It was found that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the wastewater could be reduced by 83.02% by ozonation under optimal treatment conditions. In addition, the mechanism of ozone degradation of the difficult-to-degrade wastewater was studied, and the reasons for the fluctuating variations of COD and ammonia nitrogen during ozonation treatment were explained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Environment and Resource Utilization, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environment, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China E-mail: weilinsheng@ncu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Shukai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Environment and Resource Utilization, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environment, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China E-mail: weilinsheng@ncu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Miaoqiang", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yongping Copper Mine of Jiangxi Copper Co., Ltd, Shangrao 334505, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Qihang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yinli Direct Drinking Water Equipment of Jiangxi Co., Ltd, Xinyu 338004, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jincheng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yinli Direct Drinking Water Equipment of Jiangxi Co., Ltd, Xinyu 338004, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Renya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Environment and Resource Utilization, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environment, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China E-mail: weilinsheng@ncu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Environment and Resource Utilization, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environment, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China E-mail: weilinsheng@ncu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Linsheng", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37186636", "10.2166/wst.2023.122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
