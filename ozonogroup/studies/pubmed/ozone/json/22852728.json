In the classic large-scale sinusoidal-voltage driven DBD, also known as silent or ozonizer discharge, capacitance values can be determined from charge-voltage (Q-V) plot, also called Lissajous figure. For miniature laboratory reactors driven by fast pulsed voltage waveforms with sub-microsecond rise time, the capacitance of the dielectric barriers cannot be evaluated from a single Q-V plot because of the limited applicability of the classical theory. Theoretical determination can be problematic due to electrode edge effects, especially in the case of asymmetrical electrodes. The lack of reliable capacitance estimates leads to a \"capacitance bottleneck\" that obstructs the determination of other DBD electrical parameters in fast-pulsed reactors. It is suggested to obtain capacitance of dielectric barriers from a plot of the maximal charge versus maximal voltage amplitude (Q(max) - V(max) plot) in a manner analogous to the classical approach. The method is examined using measurements of current and voltage waveforms of a coaxial DBD reactor in argon at 100 mbar driven by square voltage pulses with a rise time of 20 ns and with different voltage amplitudes up to 10 kV. Additionally, the applicability of the method has been shown for the data reported in literature measured at 1 bar of nitrogen-oxygen gas mixtures and xenon."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP), Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2, Greifswald 17489, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pipa", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoder", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koskulics", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brandenburg", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Rev Sci Instrum", "NlmUniqueID": "0405571", "ISSNLinking": "0034-6748"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22852728", "10.1063/1.4737623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
