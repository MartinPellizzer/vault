The average mixing ratios of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 36.3 \u00b1 27.9 ppbv with the dominant contribution from alkanes (55.5%), followed by aromatics (33.3%). The diurnal variation of TVOCs showed a strong photochemical consumption during daytime, resulting in the formation of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Five VOC sources were resolved by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, including solvent usage (28.6%), liquid petroleum gas (LPG) usage (24.4%), vehicle exhaust (21.0%), industrial emissions (13.2%) and gasoline evaporation (12.9%). The regional transport air masses from the upwind cities of south China can result in the elevated concentrations of TVOCs. Low ratios of TVOCs/NO<sub>x</sub> (1.53 \u00b1 0.88) suggested that the O<sub>3</sub> formation regime at WQS site was VOC-limited, which also confirmed by a photochemical box model with the master chemical mechanism (PBM-MCM). Furthermore, the observation on high-O<sub>3</sub> episode days revealed that frequent O<sub>3</sub> outbreaks at WQS were mainly caused by the regional transport of anthropogenic VOCs especially for aromatics and the subsequent photochemical reactions. This study provides valuable information for policymakers to propose the effective control strategies on photochemical pollution in a regional perspective."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
