The peritonitis severity was graded in accordance to Mannheim's index of peritonitis (MIP). The patients were divided on two groups. In 60 patients (group of comparison) the basic treatment was conducted, without immunocorrection. The patients of the main group were divided on three subgroups. To the patients of the first subgroup (43) 400 ml of ozonated isotonic solution (OIS) of sodium chloride was infused intravenously additionally in the contents of basic therapy, as well as peritoneal-enteral detoxication using OIS was conducted. In a second subgroup a regional intraabdominal endolymphatic ozonotherapy (OTH) was conducted to 57 patients with OIS and peritoneal-enteral sanation using medical ozone. In the 3d subgroup in 51 patients additionally were applied intravenous infusion of OIS and peritoneal-enteral sanation with medical ozone. To these patients cytokinotherapy was conducted, when splenopid was applied intravenously, intraperitoneally and enterally simultaneously. The indices of the T- and B-immunity links, phagocytic activity of neutrophils, including phagocytic index, phagocytic number, the completeness of phagocytosis index, as well as the content of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukins (IL) - IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 were estimated in the blood serum in dynamics. The combined staged three-level (systemic, intraperitoneal and enteral) application of natural cytokins and medical ozone have promoted mutual potentiating of their action, significant efficacy of the immunemodulating therapy in comparison with such systemic and local OTH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gadzhiev", "ForeName": "N D", "Initials": "ND"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sushkov", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klimova", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kordon", "ForeName": "T I", "Initials": "TI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ukraine", "MedlineTA": "Klin Khir", "NlmUniqueID": "9516872", "ISSNLinking": "0023-2130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "therapeutic use", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infusions, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "immunology", "surgery", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Peritonitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sorption Detoxification"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Suction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23888800"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
