Two poplar clones differing in O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity were exposed to five O<sub>3</sub> levels in open-top chambers for 97\u00a0d: charcoal-filtered ambient air (CF), non-filtered ambient air (NF) and NF plus 20\u00a0ppb (NF\u00a0+\u00a020), 40\u00a0ppb (NF\u00a0+\u00a040) and 60\u00a0ppb (NF\u00a0+\u00a060). At both leaf and plant level, isoprene emission was significantly decreased by NF\u00a0+\u00a040 and NF\u00a0+\u00a060 for both clones. Although intra-specific variability was found when the emissions were up-scaled to the whole plant, both leaf- and plant-level emissions decreased linearly with increasing concentration-based (AOT40, cumulative exposure to hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations >40\u00a0ppb) and flux-based indices (POD<sub>Y</sub> , cumulative stomatal uptake of O<sub>3</sub> \u00a0>\u00a0Y nmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> PLA s<sup>-1</sup> ). AOT40- and POD<sub>7</sub> -based dose-responses performed equally well. The two clones responded differently to AOT40 and similarly to POD<sub>Y</sub> (with a slightly higher R<sup>2</sup> for POD<sub>7</sub> ) when the emission was expressed as change relative to clean air. We thus recommend POD<sub>7</sub> as a large-scale risk assessment metric to estimate isoprene emission responses to O<sub>3</sub> in poplar."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons
