The concentration variation characteristics for the pollutants in different areas and at different times were analyzed. Using a numerical model of human respiratory exposure, 102 joggers were studied, as was the temporal-spatial variation of inhalation dose of pollutants. At typical running areas, the concentrations of CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were relatively higher in winter, whereas the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> were higher in spring and summer. The concentrations of CO, NO<sub>2,</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were lower in the afternoon (16:00-18:00), whereas the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> were lower in the morning (06:00-08:00) and evening (18:00-20:00). There was a linear correlation between concentrations roadside to those in nearby parks, as the concentrations of CO roadside were generally consistent with those in parks (<i>c</i><sub>road</sub>/<i>c</i><sub>park</sub>=1.01, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.93), the concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> roadside were higher than those in parks (<i>c</i><sub>road</sub>/<i>c</i><sub>park</sub> were 0.56 and 1.19, respectively), and the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> roadside were lower than those in parks (<i>c</i><sub>road</sub>/<i>c</i><sub>park</sub>=0.74, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.97). During moderate or higher pollution conditions, 92% of joggers halted outdoor activities, 62.7% chose to jog in parks, 66.7% chose to jog at night, and 64.7% of joggers had single run mileages of 10-20 km. When people chose to jog in the afternoon and evening, the inhalation of CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were relatively lower, whereas the inhalation of O<sub>3</sub> was higher. During spring and summer, night running after 20:00 reduced the O<sub>3</sub> inhalation dose. Running roadside led to higher inhalation of CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> than that in parks; however, O<sub>3</sub> inhalation was lower."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Shuang-Cheng", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Shuo-Han", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Xin-Zhu", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Jia-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Science and Engineering, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Shun-Xi", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Running"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29998664", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201711178"]}}]}
