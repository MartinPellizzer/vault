This provided an opportunity to study the response of changes in anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) in Shenzhen to emission reduction and to evaluate the effectiveness of current emission reduction measures. This study analyzed the variety of AVOCs before, during, and after the epidemic lockdown based on the online observation data of pollutants at Lianhua Station in Shenzhen from March 7, 2022 to March 27, 2022. Additionally, the sensitivity of ozone formation and the assessment of the reduction effect of precursors was conducted by an observation based model(OBM). The results showed that:affected by regional influences and the interference of meteorological conditions, the average value of AVOCs in Shenzhen urban areas did not drop significantly during the lockdown period compared to that before the lockdown. However, the peak of AVOCs at the morning peak time under the influence of \"sea and land wind\" during the epidemic lockdown period dropped by 46% on average compared with that during the non-lockdown period, and the aromatic hydrocarbon component dropped the most by 59%. Additionally, under the influence of continuous easterly wind, or during the accumulation and increase of AVOCs affected by regional transmission, aromatic components also decreased by an average of 25% and 21%, respectively. During the lockdown period of the epidemic in Shenzhen, the O<sub>3</sub> formation in urban areas was still AVOCs-limited. Increasing the emission reduction ratio of AVOCs was the most effective measure to reduce O<sub>3</sub> in the short term. In order to ensure the effectiveness of emission reduction, it was recommended that the coordinated emission reduction ratio of AVOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> should be greater than 1:2. It was only possible to enter the downward channel of O<sub>3</sub> if the deep emission reduction was more than 60%. This study revealed that the emission reduction of AVOCs during the morning traffic peak during the epidemic lockdown period was conducive to inhibiting the formation of O<sub>3</sub>, whereas the control of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> would promote it. Strengthening the control of local aromatic hydrocarbon components during the regional impact process could also significantly reduce O<sub>3</sub> production. At this stage, Shenzhen should strengthen the management and control of industrial solvents, especially to reduce the aromatic hydrocarbon components in the solvent source that have a greater impact on the generation of O<sub>3</sub>. Further, Shenzhen should continue to promote the reform of the energy structure of motor vehicles to reduce the emission of VOCs in fuel combustion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chu-Xiong", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou OnePoint Environmental Consultant Co.[KG-*4], Ltd.[KG-*4], Guangzhou 510220, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cheng-Liu", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Zhi-Cheng", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Tian-Fa", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guang-Cheng", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ming-di", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jian-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Disease Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37438278", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202207153"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
