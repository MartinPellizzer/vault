Although numerous observations have shown that volcanoes do not significantly contribute to the stratospheric chlorine burden, no quantitative explanation has been published. Hydrogen chloride (HCI) scavenging processes during the early phases of a volcanic eruption are discussed. A plume dynamics and thermodynamics model is used to show that HCI removal in condensed supercooled water can reduce HCI vapor concentrations by up to four orders of magnitude, preventing substantial stratospheric chlorine injection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tabazadeh", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turco", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17806335", "10.1126/science.260.5111.1082", "260/5111/1082"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
