However, most studies conducted single exposure analyses. We aim to assess the individual and combined effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, residential greenness, fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) on vitamin D levels in a national cohort study of older adults in China. We used the 2012 and 2014 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey data, and measured the environmental exposure in the same year. We interpolated the UV radiation from monitoring stations, measured residential greenness through satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), modeled PM<sub>2.5</sub> with satellite data, and estimated O<sub>3</sub> using machine learning. We dichotomized serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), the primary circulating form of vitamin D, into non-deficiency (\u226550\u00a0nmol/L) and deficiency (<50\u00a0nmol/L) categories. We used the generalized estimating equation for analysis, adjusted for sociodemographic information, lifestyle, physical condition, and season of blood draw, and calculated joint odds ratios based on the Cumulative Risk Index. We also explored the interaction between interested exposures, modification of participants' characteristics, and potential mediation. We included 1,336 participants, with a mean age of 83 at baseline. In single exposure models, the odds ratios of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) for per interquartile range increase in UV radiation, NDVI, PM<sub>2.5,</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and decrease were 0.39 (95\u00a0% CI:0.33,0.46), 0.90 (0.81,1.00), 1.65 (1.53,1.78), 1.67 (1.46,1.92), respectively. UV radiation mediated nearly 48\u00a0% and 78\u00a0% of the relationship between VDD and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, respectively. The association between UV radiation and VDD was stronger in females than men (OR: 2.25 vs 1.22). UV radiation, residential greenness can protect against VDD, while, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> increase the risk of VDD. UV radiation partly mediated the association between air pollution and VDD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..
