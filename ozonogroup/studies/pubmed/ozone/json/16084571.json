Two air quality monitoring sites in Hong Kong, i.e., Tsuen Wan and Tung Chung, are selected for the numerical experiments. The MLP-ARD model based on Bayesian evidence framework can provide reliable interval estimation of real observation as well as offering efficient strategy to avoid over-fitting. The performance comparisons between MLP-ARD model and traditional artificial neural network (ANN) model based on maximum likelihood indicate that MLP-ARD model is more powerful to capture the wild fluctuation of O3 level especially during O3 episodes than the traditional model. Furthermore, it can assess and rank the input variables for the prediction according to their relative importance to the output variable, i.e., the daily maximum O3 concentration in this study. The preliminary experimental results indicate that nitric oxide (NO) and solar radiation are the most important input variables for O3 prediction at both selected sites. In addition, the previous daily maximum O3 level is also important for Tung Chung site. In this regard, MLP-ARD model is a feasible tool to interpret the real physical and chemical process of urban O3 variation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building and Construction, City University of Hong Kong, 83, Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Wei-Zhen", "Initials": "WZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urbanization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16084571", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.06.047", "S0045-6535(05)00872-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
