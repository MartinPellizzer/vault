This study employed the functionalized colloidal microbubble technology as one-step fast HWW treatment. Inorganic coagulant (monomeric Fe(III)-coagulant or polymeric Al(III)-coagulant) and ozone were used as surface-decorator and gaseous core modifier, respectively. The Fe(III)- or Al(III)-modified colloidal gas (or, ozone) microbubbles (Fe(III)-CCGMBs, Fe(III)-CCOMBs, Al(III)-CCGMBs and Al(III)-CCOMBs) were constructed. Within 3\u00a0min, CCOMBs decreased COD<sub>Cr</sub> and fecal coliform concentration to the levels meeting the national discharge standard for medical organization. Regrowth of bacteria was inhibited and biodegradability of organics was increased after the simultaneous oxidation and cell-inactivation process. The metagenomics analysis further reveals that Al(III)-CCOMBs performed best in capturing the virulence genes, antibiotic resistance genes and their potential hosts. The horizontal transfer of those harmful genes could be effectively hampered thanks to the removal of mobile genetic elements. Interestingly, the virulence factors of adherence, micronutrient uptake/acquisition and phase invasion could facilitate the interface-dominated capture. Featured as cascade processes of capture, oxidation and inactivation in the one-step operation, the robust Al(III)-CCOMB treatment is recommended for the HWW treatment and the protection of downstream aquatic environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
