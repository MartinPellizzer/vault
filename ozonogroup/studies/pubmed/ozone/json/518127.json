It was designed to produce a constant mass transfer between the gas phase and the exposed cell phase. Monolayers of neonatal rat lung fibroblasts cultured in miniature glass dishes were used to test for ozone toxicity. The cells were alternately exposed to ozone (0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 1.35, and 4.05 ppm) for 30 sec and then to culture medium for 30 sec over a 1-hr period. Toxicity was measured as inhibition of cell growth 4 days after exposure to ozone. Growth was significantly inhibited at all concentrations with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.8 ppm. The system described was effective for quantifying ozone toxicity for cultured lung cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wenzel", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wrobel", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotek", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["518127", "10.1080/00039896.1979.10667449"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
