The percentages of cells in total apoptosis after exposure to FBC and OBC were significantly higher than in untreated control cells (<i>P</i> < .001). Moreover, OBC exposed cells exhibited significantly more total apoptosis than FBC exposed cells (<i>P</i> < .001). Compared to the untreated control, there was enhanced mRNA expression of NLRP3, Caspased-1, ASC, and IL-1\u03b2 in both FBC and OBC treated HCECs (all <i>P</i> < .01). In addition, OBC treated HCECs yielded higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA compared to FBC treated cells (<i>P</i> < .05).<b>Conclusion</b>: Both FBC and OBC particles have a cytotoxic effect on HCECs, accompanied by NLRP3 inflammasome activation, indicating that the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of the BC cytotoxic process. OBC is more toxic than FBC particles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yifei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Curr Eye Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8104312", "ISSNLinking": "0271-3683"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammasomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NLRP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PYCARD protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.36", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium, Corneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammasomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31765230", "10.1080/02713683.2019.1698051"]}}]}
