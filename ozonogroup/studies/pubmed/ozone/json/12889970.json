A careful analysis of calculated energies (considering thermochemical corrections, solvation energies, BSSE corrections, the self-interaction error of DFT, etc.) reveals that the gas-phase mechanism of the reaction is dominated by radical or biradical intermediates while the solution-phase mechanism is characterized by hydride transfer and the formation of an intermediate ion pair that includes the HOOO(-) anion. The product distribution observed for the ozonation in acetone solution can be explained on the basis of the properties of the HOOO(-) anion. General conclusions for the ozonation of alcohols and the toxicity of ozone (inhaled or administered into the blood) can be drawn."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Theoretical Chemistry, G\u00f6teborg University, Reutersgatan 2, S-413 20 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Anan", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cremer", "ForeName": "Dieter", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plesnicar", "ForeName": "Bozo", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12889970", "10.1021/ja030245m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
