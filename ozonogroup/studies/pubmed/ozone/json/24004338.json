Here we investigate how this reaction is affected by the presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of marine origin, using a heterogeneous flow reactor and detection of gaseous I2 by solvent trapping and UV/vis spectroscopy. Ozone deposition measurements over coastal seawater implied an O3 reactivity (\u03bb) toward coastal marine DOC of \u223c500 (420-580) s(-1), 2-5 times higher than that toward iodide at typical ocean concentrations (\u223c0.5-1 \u00d7 10(-7) M). We added varying amounts of highly concentrated DOC extracted from coastal seawater to I(-) solutions (1 \u00d7 10(-5) M) such that the relative reactivities of DOC and I(-) toward O3 (\u03bbDOC/\u03bbI) were in the expected range for natural seawater. The evolution of gaseous I2 and the loss of aqueous I(-) both reduced as DOC concentrations increased, with an overall suppression of I2 emissions of about a factor of 2 under conditions of \u03bbDOC/\u03bbI representative of open ocean waters (0.5-1). A kinetic model of the SML suggested that neither competition of DOC with I(-) for reaction with interfacial O3, nor direct loss of I2 and hypoiodous acid (HOI) through reaction with increasing quantities of DOC, can fully explain these results. We conclude that the suppression of I2 emissions by DOC is largely a physical effect arising from a decrease in the net transfer of I2 from the aqueous to gas phase, as suggested by recent laboratory studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of York , Heslington, York, UK Y010 5DD."}], "LastName": "Shaw", "ForeName": "Marvin D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carpenter", "ForeName": "Lucy J", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iodides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24004338", "10.1021/es4011459"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
