Col-0 and WS accelerated development and developed lesions within 10 d under increased ozone, while Cvi-0 and Th grew slowly. RNAs were used in microarray hybridizations (Col-0-based 26 000 elements, 70-mer oligonucleotides). A two-step analysis of variance (ANOVA) model, including comparison with values obtained under [O3], was used for analyses. WS showed the greatest number of changes in gene expression in response to ozone. Th showed the least changes, suggesting that its expression state at [O3] was sufficient for resistance at increased ozone. Patterns observed in ambient air controls for Cvi-0 and Col-0 were most similar, while Th showed the greatest number of differences compared with the other controls. Compared with Col-0, however, Cvi-0 showed higher levels of expression of chaperones, receptor kinase-like and photosynthesis-related genes in ambient air. Cvi-0 exhibited ozone-mediated changes in a pathway involving AtSR, a homologue of the mammalian NF kappa B family of redox-sensitive transcription factors, changes in chaperones, WRKY and C2H2 proteins and antioxidants. WS displayed ozone-mediated decreases in the expression of two AtSR/NF kappa B family members, C2-domain proteins and genes associated with cell wall growth and changes in the expression of marker genes for programmed cell death (PCD), among them RCD1, a key regulator in this pathway. Microarray data were verified by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. We relate O3-response diversity across the four lines to different responses among signaling and transcriptional response networks and differences in gene expression at [O3] levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, University of Illinois, 1201 W Gregory Drive, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pinghua", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mane", "ForeName": "Shrinivasrao P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sioson", "ForeName": "Allan A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robinet", "ForeName": "Cecilia Vasquez", "Initials": "CV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heath", "ForeName": "Lenwood S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bohnert", "ForeName": "Hans J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grene", "ForeName": "Ruth", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Plant Cell Environ. 2006 Jul;29(7):1460-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17087469", "10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01465.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
