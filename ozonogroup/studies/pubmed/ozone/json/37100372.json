Herein we aim to investigate the association between ozone exposure and glucose homeostasis, and to explore the potential role of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in this association. A total of 6578 observations from the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort (baseline and two follow-ups) were included in this study. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin (FPI), plasma C-reactive protein (CRP, biomarker for systemic inflammation), urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, biomarker for oxidative DNA damage), and urinary 8-isoprostane (biomarker for lipid peroxidation) were repeatedly measured. After adjusting for potential confounders, ozone exposure was positively associated with FPG, FPI, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and negatively associated with HOMA of beta cell function (HOMA-\u03b2) in cross-sectional analyses. Each 10\u00a0ppb increase in cumulative 7-days moving average ozone was associated with a 13.19%, 8.31%, and 12.77% increase in FPG, FPI, and HOMA-IR, respectively, whereas a 6.63% decrease in HOMA-\u03b2 (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). BMI modified the associations of 7-days ozone exposure with FPI and HOMA-IR, and the effects were stronger in subgroup whose BMI \u226524\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Consistently high exposure to annual average ozone was associated with increased FPG and FPI in longitudinal analyses. Furthermore, ozone exposure was positively related to CRP, 8-OHdG, and 8-isoprostane in dose-response manner. Increased CRP, 8-OHdG, and 8-isoprostane could dose-dependently aggravate glucose homeostasis indices elevations related to ozone exposure. Increased CRP and 8-isoprostane mediated 2.11-14.96% of ozone-associated glucose homeostasis indices increment. Our findings suggested that ozone exposure could cause glucose homeostasis damage and obese people were more susceptible. Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress might be potential pathways in glucose homeostasis damage induced by ozone exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
