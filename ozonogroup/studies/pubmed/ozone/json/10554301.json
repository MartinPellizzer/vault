Corn (Zea mays) stalk and poplar (Populus deltoides) wood lignin solutions (organosolvolytic juices) obtained from their respective autohydrolyzed materials and an organosolv lignin were treated with ozone, and the time course trend of the identified reaction products was studied. GC/MS and GC/FID were used to identify and quantify (internal standard method) the reaction products. The following acids were identified: glycolic, oxalic, malic, glyceric, p-hydroxybenzoic, and vanillic. In addition, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, syringaldehyde, and hydroquinone were also identified. All the oxyaromatic aldehydes reached maximum yields at short reaction times (between 1 and 8 min). These results were used to determine the ratio between the different phenylpropane units of their constitutive lignins. The ratio of p-hydroxyphenyl:guaiacyl:syringyl units for corn stalk, poplar wood, and organosolv lignins was 5.3:2:1, 0.1:1:1.1, and 0:1:1.1, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica-Murcia, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad de Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, Apartado 4021, 30071 Murcia, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quesada", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rubio", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10554301", "10.1021/jf970208c", "jf970208c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
