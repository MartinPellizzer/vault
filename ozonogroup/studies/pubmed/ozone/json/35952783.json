The results showed that China was the country with the largest number of patents in the field, and the United States was the main exporter of international technology flows. Chemical processes combined with biological and physical processes was the mainstream, and ozonation and electrochemical treatment were the major single technologies. Technology evolution path generally showed the transition from biological process-combined chemical treatment to electrochemical treatment and finally to physical process-combined chemical treatment. Furthermore, future trends were revealed from both patents and papers. It demonstrated that efficient removal of ammonia nitrogen, green water treatment agents and resourcezation of wastewater were the key innovation directions, and technologies with regard to efficient use of energy (including photocatalytic technology and microbial fuel cell) were the main research hotspots. Overall, this study provided a comprehensive understanding for the research and application of chemical treatment for wastewater technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
