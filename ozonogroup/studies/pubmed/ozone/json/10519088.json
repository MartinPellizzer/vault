For PAHs consisting of more than three condensed aromatic rings, soot aerosols are the main carrier, on the surface of which they can react with trace gases like ozone. In this study the clean-up procedure and analysis of ozonized benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was optimized. B[a]P and its degradation products were preseparated into three fractions. Different reversed-phase materials were evaluated for high-performance liquid chromatographic separation. Among these, a phenyl-modified silica material proved best-suited and the chromatographic separation was optimized on this material. For the detection of separated degradation products, liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS) was used. With this method, 29 components could be characterized. Besides the three known main degradation products (B[a]P-1,6-dione, B[a]P-3,6-dione, B[a]P-6,12-dione, B[a]P-4,5-dione and 4-oxa-benzo[d,e,f]chrysene-5-one (B[def]C-lactone), were identified for the first time with the help of reference substances. B[def]C-lactone is known as a substance with a mutagenic potential similar to B[a]P. Several other compounds could be tentatively identified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Hydrochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Letzel", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenberg", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wissiack", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grasserbauer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niessner", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmospheric Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10519088", "10.1016/s0021-9673(99)00716-5", "S0021-9673(99)00716-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
