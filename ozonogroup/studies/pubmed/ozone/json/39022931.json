Both positive matrix factorization \uff08PMF\uff09 and an observation-based model \uff08OBM\uff09 were used to identify the main sources of VOCs, O<sub>3</sub> production mechanisms, and sensitive species. The results showed that the average value of <i>\u03c1</i>\uff08O<sub>3</sub>-8h\uff09 during the HPP period in the urban area was \uff08246.67\u00b111.24\uff09 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and <i>\u03c1</i>\uff08O<sub>3</sub>-1h\uff09 had a peak value of 300 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The volume fractions of VOCs and NO<sub>2</sub> concentration were affected by the decrease in planetary boundary layer and wind speed, which were 76.99%-145.36% and 127.78%-141.18% higher than those in the other three periods, respectively, and were the main reasons for the aggravation of O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Alkanes, oxygenated volatile organic compounds \uff08OVOCs\uff09, and halogenated hydrocarbons accounted for 43.81%, 20.98%, and 17.43% of VOCs in urban areas, respectively. All of them showed significant growth during the HPP period, with acetone, propane, and ethane being the top three species by volume in each stage and isopentane showing the highest growth during the HPP period. Alkene, alkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons accounted for 40.19%, 28.06%, and 21.92% of the ozone generation potential \uff08OFP\uff09. 1-butene, toluene, isopentane, and isoprene were the species with higher OFP. Isoprene had the highest OFP during the PRP phase, and 1-butene had the highest OFP during the HPP phase. The volume fraction of isopentane significantly increased OFP. The correlation coefficient between VOCs and CO preliminarily indicated that motor vehicle exhaust and oil and gas volatilization were the main sources of VOCs during the HPP period. Further use of PMF revealed that solvent use sources, combustion sources, motor vehicle exhaust+oil and gas volatilization sources, industrial emission sources, and plant sources were important sources of VOCs in urban areas. The contribution of motor vehicle exhaust+oil and gas volatilization sources in the HPP period to VOCs was 3.09-14.72 times higher than that in other periods. The contribution of solvent use sources to VOCs was approximately 2.50 times higher than that in the CP and PRP periods. The main sources of VOCs volume fraction increase were motor vehicle exhaust, oil and gas volatilization sources, and solvent use sources. Potential sources and concentration weight analysis found that VOCs were also affected by the transmission of VOCs to Binzhou and Dongying in the northeast direction. The OBM results indicated that the main pathway of O<sub>3</sub> formation in urban areas was the reaction of peroxide hydroxyl radicals \uff08HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7\uff09 and methyl peroxide radicals \uff08CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7\uff09 with NO, and the net ozone generation rate during the HPP phase [<i>P</i>\uff08O<sub>3</sub>\uff09<sub>net</sub>] was 24\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Based on the sensitivity experiment results, the alkene components of 1-butene, propylene, cis-2-butene, and ethylene were the dominant species for O<sub>3</sub> production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Gui-Qin", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jun-Xiao", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Provincial Eco-environment Monitoring Center, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Miao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Provincial Eco-environment Monitoring Center, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng-Ju", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "You-Min", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Resources and Environment Innovation, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Safety and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266590, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Qi-Yue", "Initials": "QY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xiao-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39022931", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202307045"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
