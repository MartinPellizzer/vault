Sterility assurance level was achieved by an over 6-log reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 12980, and the decimal reduction value was 0.77\u2009min in sterilization mode. A reduction of over 3 logs in Limulus amebocyte lysate coagulation activity of purified endotoxin from Escherichia coli was observed after treatment in endotoxin-inactivation mode. The same inactivation ability was observed when treating dried bacterial cells. Biomaterials made of polymer or metal did not exhibit cytotoxicity after gas exposure at O<sub>3</sub> concentrations below 200\u2009ppm. As the results of human cell-based pyrogen testing, significant amounts of endotoxin that were over the limit for medical devices contacting cerebrospinal fluid (2.15\u2009EU/device) were detected on scissors washed with a washer-disinfector and sterilized with ethylene oxide or autoclaving. In contrast, endotoxin decreased to 0.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009EU/device after O<sub>3</sub> /H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> mixed gas sterilization in endotoxin-inactivation mode. Compared to conventional gas sterilization methods, O<sub>3</sub> /H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> mixed gas has high sterilization ability and a strong capacity to inactivate endotoxin. It is expected that this sterilization technology will improve the safety of reusable medical devices and utensils for regenerative medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Devices, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nomura", "ForeName": "Yusuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Cleran Group, Strategy Development Department, Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery Business Area, IHI Corporation, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamamura", "ForeName": "Junji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Devices, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Fukui", "ForeName": "Chie", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Department, Public Welfare Institute of Scientific Research Foundation, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Fujimaki", "ForeName": "Hideo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Cleran Group, Strategy Development Department, Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery Business Area, IHI Corporation, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Kazuyuki", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Cleran Group, Strategy Development Department, Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery Business Area, IHI Corporation, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Matsuo", "ForeName": "Ken-Ichi", "Initials": "KI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Cleran Group, Strategy Development Department, Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery Business Area, IHI Corporation, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kuromatsu", "ForeName": "Hisashi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Microbiology, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kikuchi", "ForeName": "Yutaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Devices, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Haishima", "ForeName": "Yuji", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biomed Mater Res B Appl Biomater", "NlmUniqueID": "101234238", "ISSNLinking": "1552-4973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JJH7GNN18P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Geobacillus stearothermophilus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "A compendium of processes, materials, test methods, and acceptance criteria for cleaning reusable medical devices.
