However, the combined effect of O<sub>3</sub>, soil N and P on isoprene emission from leaves has never been tested. We therefore examined isoprene emission in leaves of Oxford poplar clone exposed to O<sub>3</sub> (ambient, AA [35.0\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> as daily mean]; 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA; 2.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA), soil N (0 and 80\u00a0kg\u00a0N ha<sup>-1</sup>) and soil P (0, 40 and 80\u00a0kg\u00a0P ha<sup>-1</sup>) in July and September in a Free-Air Controlled Exposure (FACE) facility. We also investigated the response of isoprene emission to foliar N, P and abscisic acid (ABA) contents in September because the 2-C-methylerythritol-5-phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis produces ABA. We found that O<sub>3</sub> increased isoprene emission in July, which was associated to increased dark respiration, suggesting an activation of metabolism against O<sub>3</sub> stress as an initial response. However, O<sub>3</sub> decreased isoprene emission in September which was associated to reduced net photosynthesis. In September, isoprene emission was positively correlated with leaf N content and negatively correlated with leaf P content in AA. However, no response of isoprene emission to foliar N and P was found in elevated O<sub>3</sub>, suggesting that the isoprene responses to foliar N and P depended on the O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels. Isoprene emission rate in 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA and 2.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA increased with increasing leaf ABA content, indicating accelerated senescence of injured leaves to favor new leaf growth when high O<sub>3</sub> and nutritional availability in the soil were combined. Even though foliar N and P usually act as a proxy for isoprene emission rate, the impact of recent abiotic factors such as O<sub>3</sub> should be always considered for modeling isoprene emission under climate change."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
