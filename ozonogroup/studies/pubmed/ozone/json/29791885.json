Therefore, it is important to monitor and attenuate emerging contaminants before they can negatively affect the aquatic environment. However, due to the diversity and complexity of OMPs, there are limitations to using a single method for treating a combination of these pollutants. To address this issue, a mobile water treatment system (MWTS) equipped with different treatment units was designed to remove OMPs under field conditions. The MWTS was configured with various modular units including coagulation, flocculation, dissolved air flotation, membrane filtration, ozone oxidation, granular activated carbon, and UV disinfection. Each treatment unit could be operated either individually or in different combinations to identify the optimal configuration of treatment units for the removal of OMPs. To investigate the effectiveness of the MWTS, twelve OMPs were selected and introduced simultaneously into the feed water samples collected from different rivers throughout Korea. The current study proved that the MTWS is an effective solution to treat OMPs and is a time saving treatment system. The combined effects of the different treatment units removed over 99% of the selected OMPs, regardless of their physicochemical properties. Moreover, since the system is mobile, on-site analyses can be conducted to identify the most effective treatment method and configuration for each OMP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
