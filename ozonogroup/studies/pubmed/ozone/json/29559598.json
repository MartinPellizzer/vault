The hydropathic compression of potassium permanganate solution for 34 patients with pemphigus vulgaris served as a control. The main treatment for both groups were glucocorticoids and immune inhibitors. The lesions of patients, bacterial infection, usage of antibiotics, patient's satisfaction, and clinical curative effect were evaluated in the 2 groups.\u2029 Results: There was no significant difference in the curative effect and the average length of staying at hospital between the 2 groups (P>0.05). But rate for the usage of antibiotics was significantly reduced in the group of ozone hydrotherapy (P=0.039). The patients were more satisfied in using ozone hydrotherapy than the potassium permanganate solution after 7-day therapy (P>0.05).\u2029 Conclusion: Ozone hydrotherapy is a safe and effective aid method for pemphigus vulgaris. It can reduce the usage of antibiotics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Fuqiong", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Danqi", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaolan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wenfang", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yongzhuo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luan", "ForeName": "Chunyan", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Binbin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban", "NlmUniqueID": "101230586", "ISSNLinking": "1672-7347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00OT1QX5U4", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Permanganate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Length of Stay"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pemphigus"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Permanganate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29559598", "10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2018.02.008"]}}]}
