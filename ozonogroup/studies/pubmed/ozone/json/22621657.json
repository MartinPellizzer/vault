Although disinfection by ozone has been shown to efficiently remove this compound, the transformation products have not been identified. To that end, the reaction of ozone with 1H-benzotriazole in aqueous solution has been studied in real time employing quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS) and negative electrospray ionization. The transformation products have been identified by calculating their empirical formulas using accurate mass measurements, and further confirmed by performing the reaction with stable isotope-labeled 1H-benzotriazole and measuring product ion spectra. Stable reaction products were distinguished from transient species by plotting their extracted mass profiles. The products that resulted from ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the reaction were qualitatively identified by modifying the conditions to either promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals, or to scavenge them. Based on experimental evidence, a mechanism for the direct reaction between ozone and 1H-benzotriazole is proposed that results in the formation of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarbaldehyde, which has an empirical formula of C(4)H(3)O(2)N(3). Lastly, it was confirmed that the same transformation products formed in surface water and tertiary-treated wastewater, although they were observed to degrade at higher ozone doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Research and Development Center, Southern Nevada Water Authority, PO Box 99954, Las Vegas, Nevada 89193-9954, United States. doug.mawhinney@snwa.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mawhinney", "ForeName": "Douglas B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vanderford", "ForeName": "Brett J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Snyder", "ForeName": "Shane A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "86110UXM5Y", "NameOfSubstance": "benzotriazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22621657", "10.1021/es300338e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
