In this work, the AOC and its relationships with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were investigated with a chemical transport model (CTM) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region during the four seasons of 2017. The region-wide average AOC is ~4.5\u00d710<sup>-4</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> in summer and\u00a0~\u00a06.4\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> in winter. Hydroxyl (OH) radicals oxidation contributes 55-69% to the total AOC, followed by nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) radicals and O<sub>3</sub> (accounting for 19-34% and\u00a0<\u00a010%, respectively). The AOC attains a strong positive correlation with the O<sub>3</sub> level in all seasons. However, it is weakly or insignificantly correlated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> except in summer. Additionally, AOC\u00d7(SO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0volatile organic compound (VOC)) is well correlated with the PM<sub>2.5</sub> level, and high levels of precursors counteract lower AOC values in cold seasons. Collectively, the results indicate that the abundance of precursors could drive secondary aerosol formation in winter, and aqueous or heterogeneous reactions (not considered in the AOC estimates) are likely of importance at high aerosol loadings in the YRD. The relationship between the daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> levels is affected by the AOC magnitude. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> are strongly correlated when the AOC is relatively high, but PM<sub>2.5</sub> is independent of O<sub>3</sub> under low-AOC (<6.6\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>, typically in winter) conditions. This work reveals the dependence of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> relationships on the AOC, suggesting that joint PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> reduction could be realized at moderate to high AOC levels, especially in spring and autumn when the cooccurrence of high O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> events is frequently observed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
