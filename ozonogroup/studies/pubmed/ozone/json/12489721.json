Hence, rape has become an important agricultural plant (in Saxony 1998: 12% of the farmland) in the recent years. During flowering of rape along with intensive radiation and high temperatures, a higher production and emission of biogenic VOC was observed. The emissions of terpenes were determined and more importantly, high concentrations of organic carbonyl compounds were observed during this field experiment. All measurements of interest have been carried out during two selected days with optimal weather conditions. It is found that the origin or the mechanism of formation of different group of compounds had strong influence on the day to day variation of their concentrations. The emission flux of terpenes from flowering rape plants was determined to be 16-32 microg h(-1) m(-2) (30-60 ng h(-1) per g dry plant-540-11080 ng h(-1) per plant), in total. Limonene, alpha-thujene and sabinene were the most important compounds (about 60% of total terpenes). For limonene and sabinene reference emission rates (Ms) and temperature coefficients were determined: beta(limonene) = 0.108 K(-1) and Ms = 14.57 microg h(-1) m(-2) beta(sabinene) = 0.095 K(-1) and Ms = 5.39 microg h(-1) m(-2). The detected carbonyl compound concentrations were unexpectedly high (maximum formaldehyde concentration was 18.1 ppbv and 3.4 ppbv for butyraldehyde) for an open field. Possible reasons for these concentrations are the combination of primary emission from the plants induced by high temperature and high ozone stress, the secondary formation from biogenically and advected anthropogenically emitted VOC at high radiation intensities and furthered by the low wind speeds at this time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Troposph\u00e4renforschung, Permoserstr. 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany. konrad@tropos.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "Konrad", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pelzing", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gnauk", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kappe", "ForeName": "Anett", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teichmann", "ForeName": "Ulrich", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spindler", "ForeName": "Gerald", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haferkorn", "ForeName": "Sylvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jahn", "ForeName": "Yvonne", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herrmann", "ForeName": "Hartmut", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12489721", "10.1016/s0045-6535(02)00610-0", "S0045-6535(02)00610-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
