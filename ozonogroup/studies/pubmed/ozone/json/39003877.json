In the actual ozonation process, \u222b[O<sub>3</sub>]dt values can be calculated by monitoring the O<sub>3</sub> decay during the process. However, calculating \u222b[<sup>\u2022</sup>OH]dt is challenging in the field, which necessitates developing models to predict \u222b[<sup>\u2022</sup>OH]dt from measurable parameters. This study demonstrates the development of machine learning models to predict \u222b[<sup>\u2022</sup>OH]dt (the output variable) from five basic input variables (pH, dissolved organic carbon concentration, alkalinity, temperature, and O<sub>3</sub> dose) and two optional ones (\u222b[O<sub>3</sub>]dt and instantaneous ozone demand, IOD). To develop the models, four different machine learning methods (random forest, support vector regression, artificial neural network, and Gaussian process regression) were employed using the input and output variables measured (or determined) in 130 different natural water samples. The results indicated that incorporating \u222b[O<sub>3</sub>]dt as an input variable significantly improved the accuracy of prediction models, increasing overall R<sup>2</sup> by 0.01-0.09, depending on the machine learning method. This suggests that \u222b[O<sub>3</sub>]dt plays a crucial role as a key variable reflecting the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH-yielding characteristics of dissolved organic matter. Conversely, IOD had a minimal impact on the accuracy of the prediction models. Generally, machine-learning-based prediction models outperformed those based on the response surface methodology developed as a control. Notably, models utilizing the Gaussian process regression algorithm demonstrated the highest coefficients of determination (overall R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91-0.95) among the prediction models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
