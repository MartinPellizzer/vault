PAN concentrations were generally higher at the downtown location than at the suburban location, but on days when the O<sub>3</sub> concentration exceeded 80 ppbv, PAN concentrations were similar at both locations. On days when O<sub>3</sub> did not exceed 80 ppbv, suburban PAN concentrations were much lower than downtown concentrations and resembled those reported for rural areas in the eastern United States. Regression analysis of PAN and O<sub>3</sub> on NO<sub>x</sub> and total non-methane hydrocarbons (TNMHC) showed PAN to be most strongly dependent on morning NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations, while O<sub>3</sub> was most dependent on morning TNMHC concentrations. NO<sub>x</sub>, PAN, and meteorological data from the suburban site were used in a one-dimensional transport model to estimate the accumulation rate of PAN to be ~1.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>. A simple kinetic model estimated peroxyacetyl radical concentrations to be ~0.5 pptv at the suburban location."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aneja", "ForeName": "Viney P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hartsell", "ForeName": "Benjamin E", "Initials": "BE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Deug-Soo", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b DGA, Inc. , Ventura , California , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grosjean", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28085653", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463786"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
