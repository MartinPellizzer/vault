After 79 days of exposure, ozone reduced and elevated CO2 increased net assimilation rate. However, the effect was dependent on daily accumulated exposure. No statistically significant differences in total plant mass accumulation were observed, although ozone-treated plants tended to be smaller. Changes in atmospheric gas concentrations induced changes in allocation of resources: under elevated ozone, shoots showed high priority over roots and had significantly elevated N concentrations. As a result of different shoot N concentration and net carbon assimilation rates, photosynthetic N use efficiency was significantly increased under elevated CO2 and decreased under ozone. The differences in photosynthesis were mirrored in the growth of the fungus in symbiosis with the pine seedlings. However, exposure to CO2 and ozone both reduced the symbiosis-mediated N uptake. The results suggest an increased carbon cost of symbiosis-mediated N uptake under elevated CO2, while under ozone, plant N acquisition is preferentially shifted towards increased root uptake."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Oulu University, PL 3000, FIN-90401 Oulu, Finland; Laboratoire de Biologie Foresti\u00e8re, Associ\u00e9 INRA, Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9-Nancy I, BP 239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France; INRA-Centre de Recherches Foresti\u00e8res, Unit\u00e9 Ecophysiologie Foresti\u00e8re-Laboratoire de Pollution Atmosph\u00e9rique, F-54280 Champenoux, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kyt\u00f6viita", "ForeName": "Minna-Maarit", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le Thiec", "ForeName": "Didier", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dizengremel", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11240914", "10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1110307.x", "ppl1110307"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
