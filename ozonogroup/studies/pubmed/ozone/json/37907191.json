This review aims to provide an understanding of the sources, transformation, and fate of 6PPD-Q in water and the current knowledge on its effects on aquatic organisms. Furthermore, we discuss research gaps pertaining to the mechanisms by which 6PPD-Q acts within fish bodies. Previous studies have demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of 6PPD-Q in the environment, including air, water, and soil. Moreover, this compound has shown high lethality to certain fish species while not affecting others. Toxicological studies have revealed its impact on the nervous system, intestinal barrier function, cardiac function, equilibrium loss, and oxidative stress in various fish species. Additionally, exposure to 6PPD-Q has led to organ injury, lipid accumulation, and cytokine production in C. elegans and mice. Despite studies elucidating the lethal dose and effects of 6PPD-Q in fish species, the underlying mechanisms behind these symptoms remain unclear. Future studies should prioritize investigating the mechanisms underlying the lethality of 6PPD-Q in fish species to gain a better understanding of its potential effects on different organisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
