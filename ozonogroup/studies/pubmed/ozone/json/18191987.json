The simulated gas-phase pollutants concentrations and aerosols are compared with those observed in South Korea and the East Asia Network (EANET). The results indicate that the present modeling system including ADAM, aerosol dynamic model and MM5 model simulates quite well and the gas-phase pollutants concentrations observed in South Korea and the simulated aerosol concentrations with the gas-aerosol interaction yield much better results in concentrations than those without the gas-aerosol interaction. It is found that the favorable regions for the gas-aerosol interaction in Asia are eastern China (high pollutants emissions), Korea, Japan and the East China Sea that are downstream regions of the Asian dust sources and relatively high relative humidity. In these regions the concentrations of SO2 and O3 decrease whereas the concentrations of sulfate and nitrate increase significantly due to the gas-aerosol interaction. In particular, the increase of sulfate concentration due to the interaction is more than 30% of the corresponding concentration without the gas-aerosol interaction. It is also found that the time-area mean column concentrations of PM10, sulfate, nitrate in the model domain are respectively to be 154.9, 3.2, 3.6 mg m(-2) without the gas-aerosol interaction. However, with the gas-aerosol interaction these values have been increased to 0.6% (155.8 mg m(-2)), 16% (3.7 mg m(-2)), and 14% (4.1 mg m(-2)) of the corresponding concentration without the gas-aerosol interaction. On the other hand, the time-area mean concentration of ammonium is found to decrease about 13% (1.8 mg m(-2) to 1.6 mg m(-2)) due to the gas-aerosol interaction. The result clearly indicates the importance of the gas-aerosol interaction on the tropospheric chemistry during the long-range transport period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-742, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Jae-In", "Initials": "JI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Soon-Ung", "Initials": "SU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18191987", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.11.026", "S0048-9697(07)01219-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
