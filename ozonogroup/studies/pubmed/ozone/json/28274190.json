The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of widely applied conventional and ozone-biological activated carbon (O<sub>3</sub>-BAC) advanced treatment technology on biosafety of drinking water. The items, including assimilable organic carbon (AOC), biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC), heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) and the microorganism community structures, were used to evaluate the biosafety. Moreover, their relationships with molecular weights (MWs) and fluorescence intensity of dissolved organic matter were investigated. The results indicated that the technology provided a considerable gain in potable water quality by decreasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC, from 5.05 to 1.71\u2005mg/L), AOC (from 298 to 131\u2005\u03bcg/L), BDOC (from 1.39 to 0.24\u2005mg/L) and HPCs (from 275 to 10\u2005CFU/mL). Ozone brought an increase in DOC with low MW <1\u2005kDa, which accompanies with an increase in AOC/BDOC concentration, which could be reduced effectively by subsequent BAC process. The formation of AOC/BDOC was closely related to DOC with low MWs and aromatic protein. Bacteria could be released from BAC filter, resulting in an increase in HPC and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in effluent, while the post sand filter could further guarantee the biosafety of finished water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, College of Civil Engineering , Huaqiao University , Xiamen , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment , Tsinghua University , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Xiaobin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, College of Civil Engineering , Huaqiao University , Xiamen , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Rusen", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment , Tsinghua University , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, College of Civil Engineering , Huaqiao University , Xiamen , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Baoling", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, College of Civil Engineering , Huaqiao University , Xiamen , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhenming", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment , Tsinghua University , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaojian", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28274190", "10.1080/09593330.2017.1297850"]}}]}
