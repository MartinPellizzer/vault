However, to date, the transport behavior and source areas of ozone in the YRD region have not been systematically analyzed. In this study, by combining the ozone observational record with a HYSPLIT (hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory) model, we tried to reveal the spatiotemporal regularity of the airflow transport trajectory of ozone. Spatially, high ozone concentrations mainly clustered in industrial cities and resource-based cities. Temporally, the center of the ozone pollution shifted westward of Nanjing from 2015 to 2021. With the passage of time, the influence of meteorological elements on the ozone concentration in the YRD region gradually weakened. Marine atmosphere had the most significant impact on the transmission path of ozone in Shanghai, of which the trajectory frequency in 2021 accounted for 64.21% of the total frequency. The transmission trajectory of ozone in summer was different from that in other seasons, and its transmission trajectory was mainly composed of four medium-distance transmission paths: North China-Bohai Sea, East China Sea-West Pacific Ocean, Philippine Sea, and South China Sea-South China. The contribution source areas mainly shifted to the southeast, and the emission of pollutants from the Shandong Peninsula, the Korean Peninsula-Japan, and the Philippine Sea-Taiwan area increased the impact of ozone pollution in the Shanghai area from 2019 to 2021. This study identified the regional transport path of ozone in the YRD region and provided a scientific reference for the joint prevention and control of ozone pollution in this area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
