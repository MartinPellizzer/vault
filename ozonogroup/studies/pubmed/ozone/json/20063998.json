The authors followed a cohort of 31 asthmatic children (4-11 years of age) residing in Muang district, Chiang Mai, Thailand, from 29 August 2005 to 30 June 2006, for 306 days. The daily air pollutants, including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 microm, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 microm, carbon monoxide, ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and the meteorological parameters, including pressure, temperature, relative humidity, rain quantity, and sunshine duration, were recorded. The peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) were fitted with pollutants and meteorological covariates using general linear mixed models to account for random effects and autocorrelation. The authors found that there were inverse associations of SO(2) and evening PEFR, with a coefficient of -2.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.22 to -0.28); of SO(2) and daily percent deviation of PEFR, with a coefficient of -0.73 (95% CI = -1.33 to -0.12); and of O(3) combining with SO(2) and daily average PEFR, with a coefficient of -0.16 (95% CI = -0.31 to -0.00) and -1.60 (95% CI = -3.10 to -0.11), respectively. The associations of O(3) and SO(2) with PEFR were found even when SO(2) concentrations never exceeded the standard level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. pwiwatanadate@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wiwatanadate", "ForeName": "Phongtape", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trakultivakorn", "ForeName": "Muthita", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20063998", "10.3109/08958370903300327"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
