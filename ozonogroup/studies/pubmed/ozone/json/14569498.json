Because each molecule of O(3) rapidly bleaches one molecule of the deeply colored ITS, an OZAC value in concentration units was computed from the difference in light absorbance between the sample and the saline control multiplied by the extinction coefficient of ITS. Experiments in 0-40 micro M antioxidant solutions indicated that the OZAC values of uric acid and ascorbic acid were close to their actual concentrations and were independent of O(3) concentration. On the other hand, the OZAC of reduced glutathione and possibly human nasal lavage were nonlinearly related to antioxidant concentration and were directly related to O(3) concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rutkowski", "ForeName": "Joseph M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santiago", "ForeName": "Lizzie Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben-Jebria", "ForeName": "Abdellaziz", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ultman", "ForeName": "James S", "Initials": "JS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES06075", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14569498", "10.1080/08958370390241876", "L0507DRCC5HWB8P7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
