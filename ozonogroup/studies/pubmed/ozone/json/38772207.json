This study innovatively applied and optimized a statistics-based complex network method in atmospheric environmental field. The methodology was enhanced through improvements in edge weighting and threshold calculations, leading to the development of an advanced pollutant transport network model. This model integrates pollution, meteorological, and geographical data, thereby comprehensively revealing the dynamic characteristics of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> transport among various cities in China. Research findings indicated that, throughout the year, the O<sub>3</sub> transport network surpassed the PM<sub>2.5</sub> network in edge count, average degree, and average weighted degree, showcasing a higher network density, broader city connections, and greater transmission strength. Particularly during the warm period, these characteristics of the O<sub>3</sub> network were more pronounced, showcasing significant transport potential. Furthermore, the model successfully identified key influential cities in different periods; it also provided detailed descriptions of the interprovincial spillover flux and pathways of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> across various time scales. It pinpointed major pollution spillover and receiving provinces, with primary spillover pathways concentrated in crucial areas such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region and its surrounding areas, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Fen-Wei Plain. Building on this, the model divided the O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and synergistic pollution transmission regions in China into 6, 7, and 8 zones, respectively, based on network weights and the Girvan Newman (GN) algorithm. Such division offers novel perspectives and strategies for regional joint prevention and control. The validity of the model was further corroborated by source analysis results from the WRF-CAMx model in the BTH area. Overall, this research provides valuable insights for local and regional atmospheric pollution control strategies. Additionally, it offers a robust analytical tool for research in the field of atmospheric pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..
