The complete eradication of bacteria in a caries-affected tooth, during cavity preparation, is considered a difficult clinical task. In addition to weakening the tooth structure, attempts to excavate extensive carious tissue completely, by only mechanical procedures, may affect the vitality of the pulp. Therefore, disinfection of the cavity preparation after caries excavation can aid in the elimination of bacterial remnants that can be responsible for recurrent caries, postoperative sensitivity, and failure of the restoration. However, the effects of disinfectants on the restorative treatment have been a major concern for dental clinicians and researchers. This review aims to explore existing literature and provide information about different materials and techniques that have been used for disinfecting cavity preparations and their effects and effectiveness in operative dentistry and, therefore, helps dental practitioners with clinical decision to use cavity disinfectants during restorative procedures. Antimicrobial effectiveness and effects on the pulp and dental restorations, in addition to possible side effects, were all reviewed in this paper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dental Sciences, College of Dentistry King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, e-mail: malshowaish@ksu.edu.sa."}], "LastName": "Bin-Shuwaish", "ForeName": "Mohammed S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Contemp Dent Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101090552", "ISSNLinking": "1526-3711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzalkonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9009-62-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Propolis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MOR84MUD8E", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorhexidine gluconate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzalkonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Cavity Preparation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dentistry, Operative"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morinda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oral Surgical Procedures"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Propolis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvadoraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27794161", "10.5005/jp-journals-10024-1946", "1526-3711-1713"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
