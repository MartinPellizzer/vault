Aquatic humus in lake water (LW), artificially recharged groundwater (AW), and purified artificially recharged groundwater (PW) were fractionated by high-pressure size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) with UV-254nm detection before and after oxidation, a technique which resulted generally in seven peaks. The sum of the molecular size fractions (SMSF) of the LW was reduced by 47% during the bank filtration process, and the SMSF of the AW was reduced by 55% during the process in the water treatment plant. The oxidation of the AW resulted in reductions in the range of 18-35% of the SMSF; the respective range of the PW was 15-69%. However, the content of the total organic carbon (TOC) reduced only slightly, and a high correlation between the TOC and the SMSF (0.911) was observed in the whole material. The greatest decreases appeared in the highest-molecular-weight fractions while the low-molecular-weight fractions remained nearly unchanged. The total content of the six organic small-molecular-weight acids (sum of the organic acids, SOA) (formate, acetate, propionate, pyruvate, oxalate, and citrate) varied between 0.1-5.1% and 0.1-9.7% of the reduced TOC in the AW and the PW, respectively. The formation of the SOA, especially of oxalate, was the greatest after hydrogen peroxide combined with ozonation (as much as 1,100 microg/L), while chlorination resulted in the SOA of < 50 microg/L."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health, National Public Health Institute, Kuopio, Finland. tiia.myllykangas@ktl.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myllykangas", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nissinen", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rantakokko", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martikainen", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vartiainen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14333-13-2", "NameOfSubstance": "permanganic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12171403", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00517-6", "S0043-1354(01)00517-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
