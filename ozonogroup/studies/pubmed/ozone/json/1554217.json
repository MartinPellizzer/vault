Because of the complexities inherent in studying this phenomenon in whole animals, we developed a model of ozone-induced effects on airway physiology using the isolated perfused rat lung. Rat lungs were suspended in an airtight chamber and perfused via the pulmonary circulation with a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 4.5% bovine albumin. Ventilation of the lungs was achieved by generating a fluctuating negative pressure within the chamber (-2 to -7 cm H2O) at a rate of 60 breaths/min. The lungs were ventilated with humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 alone (control condition) or mixed with ozone at 1.0 or 2.0 ppm. Transpulmonary pressure, flow rate, and tidal volume were recorded at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours, and pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were calculated. There was no significant difference in lung weight/total body weight ratios between the three groups at the end of the 3-h period. RL increased and Cdyn decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner with ozone exposure. The percent increase above baseline in RL +/- SEM at 3 h was 9.4 +/- 4.1% for control lungs, 21.0 +/- 3.2% for 1.0 ppm ozone-exposed lungs, and 63.6 +/- 13.5% for 2.0 ppm ozone-exposed lungs. The percent decrease below baseline in Cdyn +/- SEM at 3 h was 27.4 +/- 2.1% for control lungs, 37.1 +/- 2.7% for 1.0 ppm ozone-exposed lungs, and 55.2 +/- 7.3% for 2.0 ppm ozone-exposed lungs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "California Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pino", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonald", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berry", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joad", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tarkington", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyde", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-07055", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Compliance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perfusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1554217", "10.1164/ajrccm/145.4_Pt_1.882"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
