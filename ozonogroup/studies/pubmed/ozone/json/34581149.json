Currently, few studies have focused on the identification of odorants and the quantification of emissions from these building materials. Here, we summarize the analytical methods available for the study of indoor odorants and evaluate existing understanding of odorants from nine kinds of building materials, namely plaster board, wood-based materials, linoleum, carpets, plastics, rubber, artificial leather, paints, and adhesives. The possible odor-causing compounds emitted by these different materials and their odor threshold values are identified. Finally, suggestions are proposed for future research and control measures to minimize indoor odor pollution. Overall, olfactometry is the most important tool for odor analysis desite the non-standardized application of the technique when used in the assessment of odor emissions from building materials. In addition, there are large differences in the reported patterns of odorant emissions from building materials, although oxidized substances such as aldehydes, ketones, and acids are frequently identified in association with the aging of the materials via processes such as oxidation and ozone degradation over time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wan-Zhong", "Initials": "WZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory for Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Peng-Yi", "Initials": "PY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Construction Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Olfactometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581149", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202101284"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
