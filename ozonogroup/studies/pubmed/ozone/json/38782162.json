Catalytic ozonation with metal-free catalysts has attracted increasing attention to eliminate the risk of secondary pollution of byproducts in water treatment. Here, we compared the disinfection efficiency and microbial community of catalytic ozone with a type of metal-free catalyst fluorinated ceramic honeycomb (FCH) and NaClO disinfectants under laboratory- and pilot-scale conditions. Under laboratory conditions, the disinfection rate of catalytic ozonation was 3\u223c6-fold that of ozone when the concentration of Escherichia coli was 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup>\u00a0CFU/ml, and all E. coli were killed within 15\u00a0s. However, 0.65\u00a0mg/L NaClO retained E. coli after 30\u00a0min using the traditional culturable approach. The microorganism inactivation results of raw reservoir water disinfected by catalytic ozonation and ozonation within 15\u00a0s were incomparable based on the cultural method. In pilot-scale testing, catalytic ozonation inactivated all environmental bacteria within 4\u00a0min, while 0.65\u00a0mg/L NaClO could not achieve this success. Both catalytic ozonation and NaClO-disinfected methods significantly reduced the number of microorganisms but did not change the relative abundances of different species, i.e., bacteria, viruses, eukaryotes, and archaea, based on metagenomic analyses. The abundance of virulence factors (VFs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) was detected few in catalytic ozonation, as determined by metagenomic sequencing. Some VFs or ARGs, such as virulence gene 'FAS-II' which was hosted by Mycobacterium_tuberculosis, were detected solely by the NaClO-disinfected method. The enriched genes and pathways of cataO<sub>3</sub>-disinfected methods exhibited an opposite trend, especially in human disease, compared with NaClO disinfection. These results indicated that the disinfection effect of catalytic ozone is superior to NaClO, this finding contributed to the large-scale application of catalytic ozonation with FCH in practical water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
