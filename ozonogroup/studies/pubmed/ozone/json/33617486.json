Between 14 and 87 campaigns were performed between 2014 and 2018 in five WWTPs. High removals of 3 log for both EC and IE, and lower removals of 1-2 log for SSR and RNA-F bacteriophages, were observed in conventional activated sludge and biofiltration WWTPs. The MBR WWTP achieves notably greater removals of 4.5-5.5 log for faecal bacteria and 3-4 log for SSR and RNA-F bacteriophages. This WWTP is the only one already in compliance with reuse standards, the other ones being non-compliant because of SSR and RNA-F bacteriophages. The implementation of a micro-grain activated carbon process would increase the WWTP removals of 0.8 log for faecal bacteria, due to particles retention, with no significant effect on both other pathogens. Ozonation (0.9-1.3 g O<sub>3</sub>/g dissolved organic carbon) or performic acid (0.8-1.2 ppm) would have greater benefits with additional removals of 1.5-2.5 log for EC, 1-2 log for IE and 0.5-1 log for SSR and RNA-F bacteriophages. Correlations between pathogen indicator removals and initial concentrations were found, as well as a significant decrease of RNA-F bacteriophage concentrations in Parisian raw wastewater, below 2 log. Thus, RNA-F bacteriophages could be a real issue to evaluate the compliance of Parisian wastewater with reuse. The time evolution of removals demonstrated that SSR is the most problematic parameter regarding reuse in conventional activated sludge and biofiltration WWTPs, as its initial concentration is high (5 log) but removals insufficient (<2 log). In contrast, removals of RNA-F bacteriophages greater than 2 log can be obtained within WWTPs completed or not with a tertiary treatment when the initial concentration in raw wastewater is sufficient. Correlations were also found between the removals of pathogen indicators and the removals of physico-chemical parameters, but they are not good enough to allow performance predictions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SIAAP (service public de l'assainissement francilien), Direction Innovation, 82 avenue Kl\u00e9ber 92700, Colombes, France E-mail: romain.mailler@siaap.fr."}], "LastName": "Mailler", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SIAAP (service public de l'assainissement francilien), Direction Innovation, 82 avenue Kl\u00e9ber 92700, Colombes, France E-mail: romain.mailler@siaap.fr."}], "LastName": "M\u00e8che", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SIAAP (service public de l'assainissement francilien), Direction Innovation, 82 avenue Kl\u00e9ber 92700, Colombes, France E-mail: romain.mailler@siaap.fr."}], "LastName": "Rocher", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33617486", "10.2166/wst.2021.004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
