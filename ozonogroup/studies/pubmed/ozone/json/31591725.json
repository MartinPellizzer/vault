Fruit senescence directly affects sensorial and nutritional quality during postharvest life. It has been clarified that reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage are responsible for fruit senescence. Some cultivars of yellow-fleshed kiwifruit can be stored for a short period compared with green-fleshed kiwifruit. Postharvest performance is affected by the physiological state of the fruit at harvest, associated with its postharvest management. Among several postharvest applications, ozone treatment is considered as a cost-effective and eco-friendly food-processing technology to preserve the fruits' quality during cold storage. In this study, we investigated the influence of ozone, after gradual cooling treatment, on the antioxidant defense system in Actinidia chinensis, 'Soreli'.", "Bioactive compound content decreased during cold storage, and ozone treatment enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase during cold storage. This treatment preserved membrane integrity by inhibiting lipoxygenase activity and malondialdehyde accumulation. A multivariate statistical approach, using principal component analysis, provided the global response to the effect of ozone postharvest treatment during cold storage in kiwifruit 'Soreli'.", "Ozone treatment improves the efficiency of antioxidative system and storability of 'Soreli' kiwifruits. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest systems (DIBAF), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goffi", "ForeName": "Valentina", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e l'Analisi dell'Economia agraria (CREA), Centro di ricerca Olivicoltura, Frutticoltura e Agrumicoltura, Caserta, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magri", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest systems (DIBAF), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1866-8741"], "LastName": "Botondi", "ForeName": "Rinaldo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e l'Analisi dell'Economia agraria (CREA), Centro di ricerca Olivicoltura, Frutticoltura e Agrumicoltura, Caserta, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5284-0333"], "LastName": "Petriccione", "ForeName": "Milena", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Actinidia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nishiyama I, Fruits of the Actinidia genus.
