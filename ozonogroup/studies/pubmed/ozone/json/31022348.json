Upon ozonation, a decrease in DOM absorbance was observed in parallel with an increase in singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) and fluorescence quantum yields (\u03a6<sub>1O2</sub> and \u03a6<sub>F</sub>). The increase in \u03a6<sub>1O2</sub> was attributed to the formation of quinone-like moieties during ozonation of the phenolic moieties of DOM, while the increase in \u03a6<sub>F</sub> can be explained by a significant decrease in the internal conversion rate of the first excited singlet state of the DOM (<sup>1</sup>DOM*). It is a consequence of an increase in the average energy of the first electronic transition (S<sub>1</sub> \u2192 S<sub>0</sub>) that was assessed using the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission (\u03bb<sub>F,max</sub>). Furthermore, ozonation did not affect the ratio of the apparent steady-state concentrations of excited triplet DOM (<sup>3</sup>DOM*) and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, indicating that ozonation does not affect the efficiency of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production from <sup>3</sup>DOM*. The consequences of these changes for the phototransformation rates of micropollutants in surface waters were examined using photochemical model calculations. The decrease in DOM absorbance caused by ozonation leads to an enhancement of direct photolysis rates due to the increased transparency of the water. Rates of indirect photooxidation induced by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and <sup>3</sup>DOM* slightly decrease after ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering , University of Colorado , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leresche", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering , University of Colorado , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6529-0892"], "LastName": "McKay", "ForeName": "Garrett", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering , University of Colorado , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurtz", "ForeName": "Tyler", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133 , CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf , Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) , Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , CH-1015 Lausanne , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6852-8977"], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133 , CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6848-947X"], "LastName": "Canonica", "ForeName": "Silvio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering , University of Colorado , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3311-9089"], "LastName": "Rosario-Ortiz", "ForeName": "Fernando L", "Initials": "FL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31022348", "10.1021/acs.est.8b06410"]}}]}
