The Fenton-like AOP has been conducted as the pre-treatment of textile effluent involving the activation of persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as a single and the mixed oxidants by using the Flyash (FA)-Pd composite particles as the activator. The maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 84% has been observed for a stand-alone O<sub>3</sub> based treatment at an O<sub>3</sub> flow rate of 5-6\u00a0g\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>. By conducting the pre-treatment of textile effluent with the PS, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and mixed oxidants (PS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) based Fenton-like AOPs, the COD removal after an O<sub>3</sub> based post-treatment has been observed to be 83, 87, and 93% respectively at an O<sub>3</sub> flow rate of 2, 3, and 5\u00a0g\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>. Hence, the Fenton-like pre-treatment involving the activation of mixed oxidants has been determined to be the best method for the highest COD removal of real-time textile effluent. The optimum values of initial oxidant-ratio (initial [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]:initial [PS]), initial oxidant-dosage, and ozonation time, for the mixed oxidants based Fenton-like pre-treatment, have been determined to be 3\u00a0wt% mM<sup>-1</sup>, 6:2\u00a0wt% mM<sup>-1</sup>, and 60\u00a0min respectively. Under the most optimum conditions, the COD removal has been attributed to the combination of O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> (for the pre-treatment) and <sup>\u2022</sup>OOH (for the post-treatment) which possess relatively lower oxidation potential values."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
