For that purpose, groundwater from the production wells supplying the towns Zrenjanin and Temerin (Vojvodina, Serbia) was used. Due to its complex composition, the purification system required the combination of the electroreduction/electrocoagulation, using iron and aluminum electrode plates with/without ozonation, followed by the electromagnetic treatment and the finally by the simultaneous ozonation/UV treatment. The electroreduction was used for the removal of nitrates, nitrites, and Cr(VI), while the removal of arsenic, heavy metals, suspended solids, color and turbidity required the application of the electrocoagulation with simultaneous ozonation. Organic contaminants and ammonia were removed completely in the last treatment step by applying the simultaneous ozonation/UV treatment. All measured parameters in the purified water were significantly lower compared to the regulated values. Under the optimum treatment conditions, the removal efficiencies for color, turbidity, suspended solids, total arsenic, total chromium, Ni(II), total copper, sulfates, fluorides, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites were 100%. The removal efficiencies of the total manganese and iron were 85.19% and 97.44%, respectively, whilst the final concentrations were 4 and 7\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Energy Ltd., Zagreb, Croatia. vorescan@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orescanin", "ForeName": "Visnja", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kollar", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nad", "ForeName": "Karlo", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mikulic", "ForeName": "Nenad", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Groundwater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serbia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23379949", "10.1080/10934529.2013.729896"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
