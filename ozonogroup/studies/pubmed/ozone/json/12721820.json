A strong relationship between O(3) column depth and the ratio of UV-B to PAR irradiance ( F(uv-b)/ F(par)) was recorded at ground level ( r(2)=92%, P<0.001). Weaker, but significant, associations between O(3) column depth and ground level unweighted and biologically effective UV-B radiation (UV-B(be)) were also found. Regression analyses indicated that F(uv-b)/ F(par) was the best predictor for concentrations of UV-B screening pigments and total carotenoids extracted from plant tissues. Concentrations of these pigments were loosely ( r(2)= ca. 30%) but significantly ( P<0.01) positively associated with F(uv-b)/ F(par). Concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were also positively associated with irradiances and daily doses of unweighted UV-B and UV-B(be) radiation. The concentrations of chlorophylls a and b were apparently unaffected by O(3) depletion. The data derived from this study suggest that changes to the radiative environment associated with stratospheric O(3) depletion influence the pigmentation of A. regularis. As a corollary, flavonoids are shown to be present in tissues of A. regularis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council, High Cross, Madingley Road, CB3 0ET, Cambridge, UK. k.newsham@bas.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newsham", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bryopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Planta. 1989 Feb;177(2):228-36", "ArticleIdList": ["24212345"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 2001 Mar;127(1):1-10", "ArticleIdList": ["28547159"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 2001 Feb;125(2):738-51", "ArticleIdList": ["11161031"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Dec 21;96(26):15310-5", "ArticleIdList": ["10611381"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc. 1999 Aug;74(3):311-45", "ArticleIdList": ["10466253"]}, {"Citation": "J Chromatogr. 1987 Jan 2;384:371-82", "ArticleIdList": ["3818856"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12721820", "10.1007/s00442-003-1191-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
