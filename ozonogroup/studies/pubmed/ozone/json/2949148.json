Firstly, components of humic acid (resorcinol, vanillin, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, protochatechuic acid and benzoic acid) were tested and were not found to show a desmutagenic effect. By contrast, lignin did show a desmutagenic effect. The desmutagenic effect of humic acid was decreased by ozone treatment, and the degree of decrease corresponded with a decrease in KMnO4 consumption. Benzo[a]pyrene and humic acid were incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h and extracted by ethyl acetate and the extract was investigated by gas chromatography (GC). The peak of the decomposition product did not appear, but the amount of benzo[a]pyrene was decreased. This suggests that the desmutagenic effect of humic acid was caused by adsorption of benzo[a]pyrene by humic acid rather than by decomposition of benzo[a]pyrene. Humic acid had the largest adsorption activity at its critical micelle concentration (CMC), while adsorbed benzo[a]pyrene could be released by ultrasonication. Fulvic acid and water-soluble humic substance showed a slight inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ose", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagase", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayase", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XII14C5FXV", "NameOfSubstance": "fulvic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2949148", "10.1016/0027-5107(87)90050-9", "0027-5107(87)90050-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
