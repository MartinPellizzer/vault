The predictor variable was the postoperative medication used after third molar surgery. Using the split-mouth design, the study group received topical ozone without postoperative systemic antibiotics, whereas the control group did not receive ozone but only systemic antibiotics. The 2 groups were prescribed analgesics for 2\u00a0days. The assessing surgeon was blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome variables were postoperative mouth opening, pain, and swelling. The secondary outcome variable was the number of analgesic doses required by each group on postoperative days 3 to 5. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, paired t tests, and 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (P < .05). SPSS 20.0 was used for data analysis.", "The study sample included 33 patients (n\u00a0= 33 in each group). The study group showed statistically relevant decreases in postoperative pain, swelling, and trismus. Further, the number of analgesics required was smaller than in the control group. No adverse effects of ozone gel were observed in any patient.", "Ozone gel was found to be an effective topical agent that considerably improves patient comfort postoperatively and can be considered a substitute of postoperative systemic antibiotics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.
