While O<sub>3</sub> pollution has emerged as a prominent concern in southwestern China yet variations in O<sub>3</sub> levels during 2013-2020 are still unclear and the dominant factor in explaining the long-term O<sub>3</sub> trend throughout the SCB remains elusive due to uncertainties in emission inventory and variability associated with meteorological conditions. Here, we use extensive basin-wide ambient measurements to examine the spatial pattern and trend of O<sub>3</sub> and leverage OMI and TROPOMI satellites in conjunction with MEIC emission inventory to track emission changes. Sensitivity simulations are conducted by using WRF-CMAQ model to investigate the impacts of meteorological variability and emission changes on O<sub>3</sub> changes over 2013-2020. O<sub>3</sub> concentrations exhibit obvious interannual increases during 2013-2019 and a slight decrease in 2020. Both decreases in the MEIC emission inventory (-2.9% yr<sup>-1</sup>) and OMI NO<sub>2</sub> column density (-3.1% yr<sup>-1</sup>) reflects the declining trend in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions over 2013-2020, while anthropogenic VOCs were not adequately regulated during 2013-2017, which explained the majority of deteriorated O<sub>3</sub> pollution from 2013 to 2017. Furthermore, attribution analysis based on CMAQ simulations indicate that the unexpected aggravated O<sub>3</sub> levels in 2019 is not only modulated by disproportional reductions in VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, but also associated with unfavorable meteorological conditions featured by profound heatwaves and frequent stagnant conditions. In 2020, the abnormal meteorological conditions in May leads to substantial increase of O<sub>3</sub> by 26.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> as compared to May 2019, while the considerable enhancement was fully offset by low O<sub>3</sub> levels over the whole period which attributes to substantial emission reductions. This study reveals the long-term trend of O<sub>3</sub> levels and precursor emissions and highlights the effects of meteorological variability and emission changes on O<sub>3</sub> pollution over the SCB, with strong implications for designing effective O<sub>3</sub> control measures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
