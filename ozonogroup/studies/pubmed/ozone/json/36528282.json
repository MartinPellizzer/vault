Aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S.aureus and their effect on the physical properties MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred disk-shaped specimens (diameter 10\u00a0mm and thickness 3\u00a0mm) were developed by using polyvinylsiloxane impression material and inoculated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S.aureus in an in-vitro setup. The samples were arbitrarily isolated into five groups and subjected for 3\u00a0min to the designated disinfection modality. Group 1 Control, group 2: GaH, group 3: 0.1% RF, group 4: MI, and group 5 OG. Following decontamination, the physical properties (contact angle, strain-in-compression, and tear strength) of impression materials were evaluated. Statistical analysis for CFU/mL (log10) for exposed E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S.aureus was performed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison tests at a p-value of less than 0.05.", "The most effective antimicrobial efficacy for impression disinfection against all scrutinized microbial colonies were displayed by group 5 OG and the lowest disinfection effectiveness was unveiled by the control group with no treatment. The intragroup comparison revealed that impression disinfection with GaH, MI, and ozone corroborated analogous antimicrobial efficacy(p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The disinfecting capacity of the impression material with 0.1% RF was significantly less than MI, GaH, and OG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "Disinfection of polyvinyl siloxane impression material with ozone gas, microwave irradiation, and glutaraldehyde demonstrated reasonable antimicrobial efficiencies against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S.aureus with no detrimental effects on the physical properties of impression material. More studies are advocated to extrapolate the findings of the present study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
