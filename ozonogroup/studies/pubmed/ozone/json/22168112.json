However, air pollution levels in China are still at the higher end of the world level. Less information is available regarding changes in national levels of other pollutants such as PM2.5 and ozone. The Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection (MOEP) set an index for \"controlling/reducing total SO2 emissions\" to evaluate the efficacy of air pollution control strategy in the country. Total SO2 emissions declined for the first time in 2007. Chinese epidemiologic studies evidenced adverse health effects of ambient air pollution similar to those reported from developed countries, though risk estimates on mortality/morbidity per unit increase of air pollutant are somewhat smaller than those reported in developed countries. Disease burden on health attributable to air pollution is relatively greater in China because of higher pollution levels. Improving ambient air quality has substantial and measurable public health benefits in China. It is recommended that the current Chinese air quality standards be updated/revised and the target for \"controlling/reducing total SO2 emissions\" be maintained and another target for \"reducing total NO2 emissions\" be added in view of rapid increase in motor vehicles. Continuous and persistent efforts should be taken to improve ambient air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. bhchen@shmu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Bingheng", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kan", "ForeName": "Haidong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Renjie", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Songhui", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Chuanjie", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22168112", "10.1080/10473289.2011.604288"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
