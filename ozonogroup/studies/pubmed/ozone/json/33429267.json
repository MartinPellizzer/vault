The O<sub>3</sub> fluxes reaching both surface of cell wall (F<sub>cw</sub>) and plasmalemma (F<sub>pl</sub>) were estimated considering apoplastic ascorbate, a major scavenger of O<sub>3</sub>. The difference (D) between F<sub>cw</sub> and F<sub>pl</sub> was defined as detoxification capacity of O<sub>3</sub> by reaction with ascorbate in the leaf apoplast (ASC<sub>apo</sub>). The accumulated stomatal O<sub>3</sub> flux above D nmol\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> (AF<sub>stD</sub>) and the accumulated F<sub>pl</sub> (AF<sub>pl</sub>) were calculated over the optimal integration period covering the whole reproductive development of wheat, and used to derive O<sub>3</sub>AF<sub>stD</sub> yield-response relationships in comparison with POD<sub>Y</sub> (phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> dose above a threshold of Y nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>) and AOT40 (accumulated O<sub>3</sub> dose over a threshold of 40\u00a0ppb). There was a good agreement between the observed and modeled values of ASC<sub>apo</sub> and stomatal conductance. AF<sub>stD</sub> and AF<sub>pl</sub> performed better than POD<sub>Y</sub> and AOT40 in terms of R<sup>2</sup> and intercept. However, the AF<sub>stD</sub> metric was more suitable for assessing grain yield loss due to lower sensitivity of the regression slope to variations in the input parameters, compared with AF<sub>pl</sub>. The average critical level (CL) of four cultivars for 5% grain-yield reduction was 1.53\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> using POD<sub>6</sub> and 2.81\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> using AF<sub>stD</sub>, with the latter being well above the POD<sub>6</sub>-derived value for European cultivars (1.3\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>). The minimum hourly averaged O<sub>3</sub> concentration contributed to CLs was below 20\u00a0ppb according to AF<sub>stD</sub>, a value that is lower than that suggested by POD<sub>6</sub> (\u224827\u00a0ppb). O<sub>3</sub> flux-response relationships and CLs on the basis of quantified detoxification capacity shall facilitate the understanding of the different degrees of susceptibility to O<sub>3</sub> among species or cultivars, and improve the assessments of O<sub>3</sub> impacts on plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
