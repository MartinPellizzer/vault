Concentrations of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a typical e-waste dismantling workshop were 137\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 135\u00a0ng/m<sup>3</sup> and 42\u00a0ng/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, which were lower than those without emission control measures. The partial removal of pollutants due to the emission control measures also decreased the ozone formation potential and non-cancer risk of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In the workshop, the lifetime cancer risk (LCR) of VOCs (8.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup>) was close to the recommended values. Conversely, the LCR of PAHs (3.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup>) and the total exposure index of PBDEs (19\u00a0ng/d) were remarkably lower than the recommended values of 10<sup>-3</sup> and that without emission control measures, respectively. Meanwhile, the concentrations of TVOCs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs), PBDEs, and PAHs in the outlet were approximately 10-30 times higher than those in the workshop. In addition, the LCR of TVOCs within a 5-km radius area remained higher than the accepted value (10<sup>-6</sup>), and the inhalation exposure risk of PCDD/Fs within a 20-km radius area was five times higher than the recommended value. Therefore, the emissions from e-waste recycling processes should be considered as an important source of air pollution, and more efficient control measures should be taken in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
