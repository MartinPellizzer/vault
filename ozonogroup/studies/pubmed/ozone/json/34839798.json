Due to irradiation, the concentration of high molecular weight (HMW) molecules decreased, and that of the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction increased. Microbiological analyses showed that biodegradation was neglectable. To assess the consequences for water treatment processes, coagulation jar tests were performed by comparing the removal effectivity for NOM fractions from irradiated and unirradiated raw water. The degree of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal by coagulation was lower for irradiated waters. As primarily HMW organic compounds are removed by coagulation, the decrease in coagulation performance is attributed to the increase in the LMW concentration due to photochemical reactions induced by solar radiation. Flocs were about 15% larger for irradiated water. Possibilities to adapt water treatment to respond to changes in DOC composition and concentration are outlined. Ozonation-biofiltration is judged as the most promising treatment process to cope with climate change-related challenges in drinking water treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hydro-Ingenieure GmbH, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hochschule Magdeburg-Stendal, FB Wasser, Umwelt, Bau und Sicherheit Magdeburg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Supply Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany."}], "LastName": "Slavik", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Supply Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kostrowski", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2016-6078"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Supply Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aquateam COWI AS, Oslo, Norway."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}], "LastName": "Uhl", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dissolved Organic Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dissolved Organic Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34839798", "10.1080/09593330.2021.2007289"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
