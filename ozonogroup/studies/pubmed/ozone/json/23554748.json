The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of ozone on the rheological and electrical properties of stored human blood. Venous blood samples, obtained from three healthy humans, were treated with different concentrations of ozone (30, 50, 70 and 80 \u00b5g/mL) for three weeks in vitro. Ozone was generated from portable medical-grade oxygen using electrical corona arc discharge. The ultraviolet-visible absorption of hemoglobin in the wavelength of 300-700 nm showed that ozone in this range did not interact with iron ions and it was not toxic below the concentration of 80 \u00b5g/mL. The changes of blood viscosity were also measured. The electrical conductivity and permittivity, in the frequency range from 5 to 50 MHz, were measured in the control and treated samples subjected to different concentrations of ozone at different stored periods. The results showed that the conductivity and permittivity measurements may serve as a useful indicator in the quality assessment of blood samples stored in the blood bank."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Benha University, Benha 13518, Egypt; ; Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Taibah University, Al-Ula 100823, Saudia Arabia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baieth", "ForeName": "Hoda El-Saied Abdel", "Initials": "Hel-S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elashmawi", "ForeName": "Islam Shoukri", "Initials": "IS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "J Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101551157", "ISSNLinking": "1674-8301"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors reported no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Zhao TX, Shanwell A.
