An increasing body of recent evidence indicates that biochars can also remove gaseous chemical contaminants, such as those occurring in industrial flue gases. However, unlike other applications such as in agroecosystems, soil amendments, and aquatic systems, comprehensive reviews on biochar applications in the field of air pollution control are still lacking. The current paper examined existing evidence to understand the nature of contaminants, particularly the gaseous ones, potential applications, constraints, and future research needs pertaining to biochar applications in air pollution control. The preparation of biochars and their functionalized derivatives, and the properties influencing their capacity to remove gaseous contaminants are summarized. The removal capacity and mechanisms of various organic and inorganic gaseous contaminants by biochars are discussed. Evidence shows that biochars effectively remove metal vapours, particularly elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>), acidic gases (H<sub>2</sub>S, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>), ozone, nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and organic contaminants including aromatic compounds, volatile organic compounds, and odorous substances. The mechanisms for the removal of gaseous contaminants, including; adsorption, precipitation, and size exclusion were presented. Potential industrial application domains include remediation of gaseous emissions from incinerators, waste-to-energy systems, kilns, biomass and coal-fired boilers/cookers, cremation, smelters, wastewater treatment, and agricultural production systems including livestock husbandry. These industrial applications, coupled with the renewable, low-cost and sustainable nature of biochars, point to opportunities to further develop and scale up the biochar technology in the air pollution control industry. However, the biochar-based air filter technology still faces several challenges, largely stemming from constraints and several knowledge gaps, which were highlighted. Hence, further research is required to address these constraints and knowledge gaps before the benefits of the biochar-based air filters are realized."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
