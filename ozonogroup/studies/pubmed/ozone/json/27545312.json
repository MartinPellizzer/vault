Step wise hydrogen atom abstraction generates the first resting state the trihydroxide -COOOH, which undergoes decomposition to produce the free radical species alkoxyl -CO\u02d9 and peroxyl \u02d9OOH thereby setting off a complex chain of radical processes. The H transfer from peroxyl radical to alkoxyl allows formation of inactive alcohol and the singlet excited dioxygen. Other competitive processes include the self fragmentation or \u03b2-scission of the alkoxyl -CO\u02d9 to give rise to a carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde) and a C-centred free radical species. Tertiary C-H bonds are most susceptible to O3 oxidation followed by secondary and primary. Among the polymers studied, poly(styrene) is the least resistant to C-H bond ozonation, followed by poly(propylene), poly(methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(vinyl chloride). Calculations also reveal catalytic effects of water in promoting the C-H bond oxidation process in polymer systems without competing H-bond donor groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University, Canberra ACT 2601, Australia. michelle.coote@anu.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Richmond", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Coote", "ForeName": "Michelle L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27545312", "10.1039/c6cp05064f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
