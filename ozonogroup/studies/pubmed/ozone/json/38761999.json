In AD, the skin barrier is impaired on multiple levels. Underlying factors include genetic, chemical, immunologic, and microbial components. Increased skin pH in AD is part of the altered microbial microenvironment that promotes overgrowth of the skin microbiome with Staphylococcus aureus. The secretion of virulence factors, such as toxins and proteases, by S aureus further aggravates the skin barrier deficiency and additionally disrupts the balance of an already skewed immune response. Skin commensal bacteria, however, can inhibit the growth and pathogenicity of S aureus through quorum sensing. Therefore, restoring a healthy skin microbiome could contribute to remission induction in AD. This review discusses direct and indirect approaches to targeting the skin microbiome through modulation of the skin pH; UV treatment; and use of prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. Furthermore, exploratory techniques such as skin microbiome transplantation, ozone therapy, and phage therapy are discussed. Finally, we summarize the latest findings on disease and microbiome modification through targeted immunomodulatory systemic treatments and biologics. We believe that targeting the skin microbiome should be considered a crucial component of successful AD treatment in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
