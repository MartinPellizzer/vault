Lipid profiling of 161 lipid species for baseline fasting plasma was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.", "In search of CHD predictors, seven lipids were selected by elastic-net regression during over 90% of 1000 cross-validation repetitions, and the derived composite lipid score showed an adjusted odds ratio of 3.75 (95% confidence interval: 3.15, 4.46) per standard deviation increase. Addition of the lipid score into traditional risk model increased c-statistic to 0.736 by an increment of 0.077 (0.063, 0.092). From the seven lipids, we found mediation of CHD risk from baseline diabetes through sphingomyelin (SM) 41:1b with a considerable mediation proportion of 36.97% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We further found that the positive associations of phosphatidylcholine (PC) 36:0a, SM 41:1b, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:0 and LPC 20:3 were more pronounced among participants with higher exposure to fine particulate matter or its certain components, also to ozone for LPC 18:0 and LPC 20:3, while the negative association of cholesteryl ester (CE) 18:2 was attenuated with higher black carbon exposure (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "We identified seven lipid species with greatest predictive increment so-far achieved for incident CHD, and also found novel biomarkers for CHD risk stratification among individuals with diabetes or heavy air pollution exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
