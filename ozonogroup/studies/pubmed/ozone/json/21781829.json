Data from an O(3) exposure modeling exercise indicates that relatively few hours can account for a significant amount of the total cumulative ozone intake dose (D(I)(T)) received in a year. While O(3) concentration levels affected the hourly intake dose (D(Ih)) more than breathing rate (V \u0307 (E)), there was a distinct and significant relationship between V \u0307 (E) and D(Ih) when hours in a year were stratified by concentration levels. By investigating the V \u0307 (E) levels associated with high dose hours, it appears that activities with an hourly V \u0307 (E) rate of between 25 and 45 l/min can lead to high intake doses of O(3). The exercise literature was reviewed to ascertain which activities could lead to that range of V \u0307 (E)'s and be sustained by children for 1 h. A list of such activities was developed. If an analyst is interested only in modeling high D(Ih) hours for children aged 6-13, an efficient approach might be to focus on those activities and estimate D(I)(T) for the other hours in an aggregated manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Risk and Exposure Assessment Group, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCurdy", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9612020", "ISSNLinking": "1382-6689"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21781829", "10.1016/s1382-6689(97)10019-9", "S1382-6689(97)10019-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
