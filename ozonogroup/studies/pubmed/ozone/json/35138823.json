Focus areas include compounds emitted, air quality indoors and outdoors, odor assessment, and the potential health effects of emitted compounds. Studies suggest that \u03b2-myrcene is a tracer candidate for CCF biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Furthermore, \u03b2-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, and \u03b1-pinene are often reported in air samples collected in and around CCF facilities. The BVOC emission strength per dry weight of plant is higher than most conventional agriculture crops. Nevertheless, reported total CCF BVOC emissions are lower compared with VOCs from other industries. Common descriptors of odors coming from CCFs include \"skunky\", \"herbal\", and \"pungent\". However, there are few peer-reviewed studies addressing the odor impacts of CCFs outdoors. Atmospheric modeling has been limited to back trajectory models of tracers and ozone impact assessment. Health effects of CCFs are mostly related to odor annoyance or occupational hazards. We identify 16 opportunities for future studies, including an emissions database by strain and stage of life (growing cycle) and odor-related setback guidelines. Exploration and implementation of key suggestions presented in this work may help regulators and the industry reduce the environmental footprint of CCF facilities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z4."}], "LastName": "de Ferreyro Monticelli", "ForeName": "Davi", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9822-420X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z4."}], "LastName": "Bhandari", "ForeName": "Sahil", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V5Z 4R4."}], "LastName": "Eykelbosh", "ForeName": "Angela", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3329-184X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Services, BC Centre for Disease Control, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V5Z 4R4."}], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "Sarah B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0146-7038"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z4."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z4."}], "LastName": "Giang", "ForeName": "Amanda", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0400-2057"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z4."}], "LastName": "Zimmerman", "ForeName": "Naomi", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35138823", "10.1021/acs.est.1c06372"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
