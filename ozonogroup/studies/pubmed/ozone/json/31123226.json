Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the operating variables such as pH, dosing rate, rapid mixing time, and gentle mixing speed on TOC removal. A TOC removal of 89.805% and 79.79% was observed for SF-O and SF-W, respectively. Ferrate as SF-O and SF-W demonstrated 26.67% and 8.51% more TOC removal at a lower dosage compared to conventional chemicals such as chlorine, ozone, poly aluminum chloride (PAC) and polyelectrolyte. The optimum conditions of the independent variables including sodium ferrate (SF-O and SF-W), pH, rapid mixing time and gentle mixing speed were found to be 1.54 mg/L and 2.68 mg/L, 8.5, 30 s at 120 rpm for coagulation followed by 20 min of gentle mixing. Economic analysis showed that the application of SF instead of conventional chemicals provides a significant reduction in operational costs by about 68%, mainly because of the reduction of chemicals and energy consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Isfahan Regional Water Organization, Isfahan, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Momtazpour", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Environmental Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of medical Sciences, Ahwaz, Iran and Environmental Technologies Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran E-mail: sahand369@yahoo.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jorfi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Bushehr Branch, Islamic Azad University, Bushehr, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tabatabaie", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Bushehr Branch, Islamic Azad University, Bushehr, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pazira", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16836-06-9", "NameOfSubstance": "ferrate ion"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31123226", "10.2166/wst.2019.127"]}}]}
