To determine if seedlings and mature trees were similarly affected by ozone exposure, growth and nutrient concentrations in northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) 4-year-old seedlings and 32-year-old mature trees were examined after treatment with subambient, ambient and twice ambient concentrations of ozone for three growing seasons. SUM00 values summed over the three growing seasons were 147, 255 and 507 ppm-h, respectively, for the subambient, ambient and twice ambient exposures. For mature trees, no influence of ozone treatment on lower stem diameter growth, stem growth within the mid-canopy and foliar biomass was observed. Seedling height was increased by ozone, but biomass and diameter were unaffected. A reduction in the specific leaf weight of leaves in response to ozone coincident with the loss of recurrent flushing was observed in seedlings. Ozone exposure reduced foliar nitrogen concentrations and increased woody tissue nutrient concentrations in seedlings and mature trees at the end of the third growing season. These results suggest an influence of ozone on retranslocation processes in seedlings and mature trees."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry, Auburn University, AL 36849-5418, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samuelson", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mays", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091424", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)00067-4", "0269749195000674"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
