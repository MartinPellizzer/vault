Results showed that VOCs concentrations were 32.94, 38.10, 42.41, and 47.12 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, when the O<sub>3</sub> concentration levels were categorized as excellent, good, light pollution, and moderate pollution, respectively. VOCs were composed of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes and aromatics, which accounted for 61.72%-63.36%, 14.96%-15.51%, 2.73%-4.13%, and 18.53%-19.10%, respectively, of VOCs concentrations at different O<sub>3</sub> concentration levels. Among them, the proportion of alkanes was slightly higher when O<sub>3</sub> concentration was categorized as good or light pollution, alkenes and alkynes accounted for the highest proportion when O<sub>3</sub> concentration was excellent, and the proportion of aromatics was highest during periods of moderate pollution. The main VOCs species were propane, ethane, ethylene, toluent, <i>n</i>-butane, isopentane, <i>m</i>/<i>p</i>-xylene, propylene, acetylene, <i>n</i>-hexane, isobutene, benzene, <i>n</i>-pentane, isoprene, and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene. The concentration percentage of isopentane, <i>n</i>-pentane, benzene, ethylene, propylene, <i>n</i>-butane, and isobutane increased gradually as O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased. Significant increases in isoprene and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene were observed during periods of light and moderate pollution. Alkenes and aromatics had higher ozone formation potential (OFP), and the contribution of alkenes to OFP declined as the O<sub>3</sub> level rose, whereas that of aromatics increased. Ethylene, propylene, <i>m</i>/<i>p</i>-xylene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, toluene, isoprene, <i>trans</i>-2-butene, and <i>cis</i>-2-pentene were the key species for O<sub>3</sub> generation, and the contribution ratio of 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, isoprene, propylene, and ethylene to OFP increased significantly during light or moderate O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Positive matrix factorization was applied to estimate the source contributions of VOCs. Automobile exhaust, solvent usage, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)/gasoline evaporation, combustion, petrochemical industrial emissions, natural sources, and other industrial emissions were identified as major sources of VOCs in summer. As O<sub>3</sub> concentration level rose, the contribution percentage of automobile exhaust, LPG/gasoline evaporation, petrochemical industrial emissions, and natural sources increased gradually, whereas the contribution of combustion and other industrial emissions decreased overall. The contribution of solvent usage was lower when O<sub>3</sub> levels indicated light or moderate pollution than when it was good."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science & Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-Mei", "Initials": "WM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jing-Yun", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Mei", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Wen-Kai", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li-Wei", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34309245", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202101129"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
