UV/O<sub>3</sub> was used in the recirculation stream, partially treating the recalcitrant in aMBR permeate to improve its biodegradability, and then send back to aMBR for biodegradation. Removal performance of UV/O<sub>3</sub>-aMBR system with recirculation ratio 20, 40, 60 and 80% was tested and compared. The removal of COD<sub>Mn</sub>, UV<sub>254</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>-N increased with the increment of recirculation ratio. UV/O<sub>3</sub>-aMBR system has higher recalcitrant removal performance and less membrane fouling. The fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) was largely reduced in UV/O<sub>3</sub>-aMBR system, and the system hydrophilicity was higher than aMBR system. The Modified Stover Kincanoon model was able to describe UV/O<sub>3</sub>-aMBR system; and has higher Umax than aMBR system. UV/O<sub>3</sub>-aMBR can be develop as an effective technology in improving recalcitrant removal in polluted surface water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
