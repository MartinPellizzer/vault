As previous research has shown, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from plants can react with other urban air constituents (e.g., NOx, HO radical) and thus negatively affect regional air quality. In this pilot study, BVOC emissions from <i>Cannabis</i> plants were analyzed at four grow facilities. The concentrations of measured BVOCs inside the facilities were between 110 and 5,500\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>. One adult <i>Cannabis</i> plant emits hundreds of micrograms of BVOCs per day and thus can trigger the formation of tropospheric ozone (approximately 2.6\u00a0g day<sup>-1</sup> plant<sup>-1</sup>) and other toxic air pollutants. In addition, high concentrations of butane (1,080- 43,000\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>), another reactive VOC, were observed at the facilities equipped with <i>Cannabis</i> oil extraction stations. <i>Implications</i>: High concentrations of VOCs emitted from <i>Cannabis</i> grow facilities can lead to the formation of ozone, secondary VOCs (e.g., formaldehyde and acrolein), and particulate matter. Our results highlight that further assessment of VOC emissions from <i>Cannabis</i> facilities is needed, and this assessment is one of the key factors for developing policies for optimal air pollution control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute , Reno , NV , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samburova", "ForeName": "Vera", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute , Reno , NV , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDaniel", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute , Reno , NV , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "Dave", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Management Division, Washoe County Health District , Reno , NV , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Texas at El Paso , El Paso , TX , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stockwell", "ForeName": "William R", "Initials": "WR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute , Reno , NV , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khlystov", "ForeName": "Andrey", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31498732", "10.1080/10962247.2019.1654038"]}}]}
