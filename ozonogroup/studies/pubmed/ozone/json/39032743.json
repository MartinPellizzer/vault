While numerous studies indicate an association between air pollution and chronic kidney disease, studies on ESKD are rare. We investigated the association of long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), black carbon (BC) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) with ESKD incidence in two large population-based European cohorts. We followed individuals in the Austrian Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Program (VHM&PP) and the Italian Rome Longitudinal Study (RoLS) using dialysis and kidney transplant registries. Long-term exposure to pollutants was estimated at the home address using Europe-wide land use regression models at 100x100m scale. Hazard ratios (HR) were determined from Cox-proportional hazard models adjusted for individual and neighbourhood level confounders. We observed 501 events among 136,823 individuals in VHM&PP (mean age 42.1\u00a0years; crude incidence rate (IR) 0.14 per 1000 person-years) and 3231 events among 1,939,461 individuals in RoLS (mean age 52.4\u00a0years; IR 0.22 per 1000 person-years). In VHM&PP, there was no evidence of an association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> and ESKD. There were elevated HRs but with large confidence intervals for BC (HR 1.17 [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI): 0.98, 1.39] for 0.5*10<sup>-5</sup>/m), and for NO\u2082 (HR 1.14 [95%CI: 0.96, 1.35] for 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). In RoLS, ESKD was associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> (HR 1.37 [95\u00a0% CI: 1.06, 1.76] for an increase of 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), while there was no evidence of association with BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, or O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Our study suggests an association of air pollution with ESKD incidence, which differed between the two cohorts and may possibly be influenced by respective air pollution mixtures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
