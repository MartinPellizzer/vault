When 100\u00a0mg/L CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO was added to the reaction system, the BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration generated was 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0at pH\u00a0=\u00a07.0, 100\u00a0\u03bcM PMS addition and 1.30\u00a0mg/min ozone injection after 30\u00a0min reaction. Compared with the 6.58\u00a0\u03bcM BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> produced in the control group, the addition of CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO prominently inhibited the generation of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the inhibition efficiency reached 96.17\u00a0%. The addition of CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO inhibited the conversion of hypobromous acid, thereby inhibiting the formation of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Meanwhile, the first-order kinetic constant of the degradation of SMX by O<sub>3</sub>/PMS and O<sub>3</sub>/PMS/CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO was 0.163 and 0.422 min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The addition of CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO promoted the degradation of SMX and the removal efficiency was reached above 98\u00a0% after 10\u00a0min reaction. According to the optimization of the GO loading ratio, it was found that CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO with 20\u00a0% GO loading had the best promotion effect on the degradation of SMX, and almost completely inhibited the formation of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Finally, in the repeated cycle experiment, CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO could maintain its high catalytic activity and still had a high removal effect on SMX after three repeated uses. Besides, the BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition efficiency was above 80\u00a0% after two repeated uses. Therefore, adding synthetic CuCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GO is an effective way to control the formation of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and enhance the degradation of SMX in the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
