The majority of recent and current space instruments use reflective diffusers. As a result, numerous Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) calibration comparisons have been conducted between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other industry and university-based metrology laboratories. However, based on literature searches and communications with NIST and other laboratories, no Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution Function (BTDF) measurement comparisons have been conducted between National Measurement Laboratories (NMLs) and other metrology laboratories. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in the use of transmissive diffusers in the calibration of satellite, air-borne, and ground-based remote sensing instruments. Current remote sensing instruments employing transmissive diffusers include the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite instrument (OMPS) Limb instrument on the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) platform,, the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) on the Korea Aerospace Research Institute's (KARI) Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura platform, the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument and the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS).. This ensemble of instruments requires validated BTDF measurements of their on-board transmissive diffusers from the ultraviolet through the near infrared. This paper presents the preliminary results of a BTDF comparison between the NASA Diffuser Calibration Laboratory (DCL) and NIST on quartz and thin Spectralon samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Systems and Applications, Inc., Lanham, MD 20706."}], "LastName": "Georgiev", "ForeName": "Georgi T", "Initials": "GT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biospheric Sciences Branch, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771."}], "LastName": "Butler", "ForeName": "James J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biospheric Sciences Branch, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771."}], "LastName": "Thome", "ForeName": "Kurt", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899."}], "LastName": "Cooksey", "ForeName": "Catherine", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Systems and Applications, Inc., Lanham, MD 20706."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Leibo", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "9999-NIST", "Agency": "Intramural NIST DOC", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101524122", "ISSNLinking": "0277-786X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Butler JJ, Johnson BC, Barnes RA.
