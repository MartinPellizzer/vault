This experiment was conducted to study the purification effect and degradation product in NTP under different frequency power supply,to provide a theoretical basis for coupling with biotechnology. The results showed that the removal efficiency for mixed waste gas in the plasma first increased and then decreased with the increase of the SIE. The maximum energy efficiency was obtained at 6111 J\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> under high frequency power and 7167 J\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> under low frequency condition, respectively. Extending residence time caused a rise in mixed gas removal efficiency, but the removal load didn't always increase and the highest removal load was observed with the residence time of 5 s, so 5 s was regarded as the optimal reaction condition for the subsequent analysis in this study. The degradation products were analyzed under the specific conditions. Experimental results showed that the amount and the selectivity of carbon dioxide both increased with the increase of SIE in the plasma reactor. The amount of ozone increased to a maximum value and then decreased with the increase of SIE in the plasma reactor, and the amount of ozone produced in low-frequency power plasma was lower than that in high-frequency power. The trend of TOC values was similar to the trend of ozone generation, indicating that the best water solubility was obtained at the highest energy efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Li-Ying", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hai-Qian", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanxi Environmental Monitoring Station, Lanxi 321100, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi-Ling", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965082", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201610228"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
