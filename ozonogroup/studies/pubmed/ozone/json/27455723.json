The sequence of spin-coating of Ag and UV-ozone treatment resulted in different device performance. For devices in which Ag NPs solution was spin-coated on ITO substrates before UV-ozone treatment, power conversion efficiency increased from 3.4% to 3.7%, while the power conversion efficiency decreased if Ag NPs solution was spin-coated after UV-ozone treatment. In both cases, the short-circuit current density increased, and the open-circuit voltage remained relatively constant. The variation of power conversion efficiency mainly depended on the changing of the fill factor, which is related to film morphology of the devices.
