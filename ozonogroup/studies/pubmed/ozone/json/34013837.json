By the use of a dielectric-barrier-discharge reactor, O<sub>2</sub> was converted into O<sub>3</sub> at an O<sub>2</sub> flow rate of 0.56 mmol/(L\u00b7min), with 5 mol% O<sub>2</sub>-to-O<sub>3</sub> conversion. Using a self-supporting bubble generator, O<sub>3</sub> bubbles with an average diameter (<i>d</i><sub>bbl</sub>) of 50 \u00b5m were continuously supplied into a solution in TBA (OH\u2022 scavenger) at 303 K, and the TBA being degraded. For comparison, O<sub>3</sub> bubbles with <i>d</i><sub>bbl</sub> values of 200-5000 \u00b5m were obtained using a dispersing-type generator. It was found that the minimization of bubble diameter accelerated both O<sub>3</sub> dissolution, as a consequence of the increase in the gas-liquid interfacial area and the residence time of the bubbles, and enhanced OH\u2022 generation, because of the increase in contact probability between dissolved O<sub>3</sub> and OH<sup>-</sup> at the minute gas-liquid interfaces, caused by the accumulation of OH<sup>-</sup> around the fine bubble surfaces. To ascertain the influence on organic compound degradation of the improved oxidation potential, bisphenol A, as a model compound, was degraded by O<sub>3</sub> bubble injection at different <i>d</i><sub>bbl</sub> values. Sequentially, the high OH\u2022 selectivity obtained by minimizing the bubble diameter can effectively achieve the rapid degradation of organic compounds and intermediates under a constant O<sub>3</sub> flow rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Industrial Technology, Nihon University, Narashino, Japan."}], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "Masakazu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Industrial Technology, Nihon University, Narashino, Japan."}], "LastName": "Wada", "ForeName": "Yoshinari", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Industrial Technology, Nihon University, Narashino, Japan."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Kangjian", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology, Narashino, Japan."}], "LastName": "Onoe", "ForeName": "Kaoru", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Industrial Technology, Nihon University, Narashino, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hiaki", "ForeName": "Toshihiko", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34013837", "10.1080/09593330.2021.1931469"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
