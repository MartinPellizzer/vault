The latter condition resulted in lung damage and inflammation while the former did not. Directly after exposure surfactant was isolated and two morphologically and functionally different surfactant subtypes were obtained by differential centrifugation. Surfactant subtypes isolated from rats exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone for 2 and 12 hr showed an increase in the amount of heavy subtype and a decrease in light subtype. These results suggest that acute ozone exposure of rats can alter surfactant subtype composition. The conversion in vitro of heavy to light subtype was increased in ozone-exposed rats. Degradation of surfactant protein A (SP-A) was observed during in vitro conversion of heavy subtype isolated from ozone-exposed rats. This suggests that oxidation of SP-A may lead to enhanced susceptibility for degradation. The observed effects were more pronounced in rats exposed for 12 hr than those exposed for 2 hr, indicating that proteolytic enzymes from inflammatory cells may aggravate the observed effects. We conclude that extracellular surfactant metabolism is altered by short-term exposures to ozone and that oxidation of SP-A may contribute to the observed alterations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Veterinary Biochemistry, Utrecht University, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Putman", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boere", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Bree", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Golde", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haagsman", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7676447", "10.1006/taap.1995.1176", "S0041008X85711763"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
