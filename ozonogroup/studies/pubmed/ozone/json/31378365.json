They are volatile and gaseous in nature and may easily come in the contact of trophosphere and stratosphere. In troposphere, they are harmful to the living beings; nevertheless, in stratosphere they react with ozone and degrade the ozone layers. In this study, we have investigated the in-silico pathways of methyl halide and its toxic effect on living systems like pest, humans and environment. Till date, limited studies provide the understanding of degradation of methyl halide and its effect on the environment. This leads to availability of scanty information for overall bio-magnifications of methyl halides at molecular and cellular level. The model developed in the present study explains how a volatile toxic compound not only affects living systems on earth but also on environmental layers. Hub nodes were also evaluated by investigating the developed model topologically. Methyl transferase system is identified as promising enzyme in response to degradation of methyl halides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
