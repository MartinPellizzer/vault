This accounts rigorously for quantization of vibrational states, zero-point energy, scattering resonances, and permutation symmetry of identical atoms, while advantage is taken of the classical scattering regime. Energy is exchanged between vibrational, rotational, and translational degrees of freedom while the total energy is conserved. Application of this method to stabilization of the van der Waals states in ozone is presented. Examples of mixed quantum-classical trajectories are discussed, including an interesting example of supercollision. When combined with an efficient grid mapping procedure and the reduced dimensionality approximation, the method becomes very affordable computationally."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Wehr Chemistry Building, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "Mikhail V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Babikov", "ForeName": "Dmitri", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21495742", "10.1063/1.3576103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
