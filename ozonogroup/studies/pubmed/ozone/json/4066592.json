The initial purpose of the present investigation was to study the effects of O3 inhalation on pulmonary function and selected exercise respiratory metabolism and breathing pattern responses in young adult females. Six female subjects exercised continuously on a bicycle ergometer for 1 h on 10 occasions at one of three intensities, while exposed to 0.0, 0.20, 0.30, or 0.40 ppm O3. Forced expiratory volume and flow rates and residual volume (RV) were measured before and immediately following each protocol. During exercise, expired minute ventilation (VE), respiratory frequency (fR), tidal volume, O2 uptake (VO2), and heart rate (HR) were measured every 10 min. O3 dose-dependent decrements were observed for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), and forced expiratory flow rate during the middle half of FVC, coupled with an increase in RV and altered exercise ventilatory pattern. There was also an increased VE but no significant O3 effect on VO2 or HR. Comparison of the females' responses to those of a group of young adult males (previously studied) at the same total O3 effective dose (i.e., expressed as the simple product of O3 concentration, VE, and exposure time) revealed significantly greater effects on FVC, FEV1.0, and fR for the females. With VE reduced for females as a function of exercise intensity at the same percent of maximum VO2, these differences were considerably attenuated, although not negated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lauritzen", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Volume Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4066592", "10.1152/jappl.1985.59.5.1601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
