All roots were sterilized and then inoculated with E.faecalis. Before and after final irrigation procedures, root canals were sampled and the grown colony forming units (CFUs) were counted. Data were analyzed by Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests using a 0.05 significance level.", "The EndoVac reduced more bacteria than the conventional needle did but it was not statistically significant (p>0.05). NaOCl alone or followed by EDTA totally eliminated bacteria. OW + EDTA showed higher reduction of bacteria but could not totally eliminate bacterias.", "In the context of bacterial elimination, the EndoVac was not significantly better than the conventional needle. Although, there were fewer CFU/mg when using EndoVac, there was not any statistically significant superiority to conventional needle irrigation. An OW+EDTA regimen showed antibacterial effect in the primary molar root canals but it was significantly less effective than NaOCl+EDTA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buldur", "ForeName": "Burak", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kapdan", "ForeName": "Arife", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Pediatr Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "9100079", "ISSNLinking": "1053-4628"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Root Canal Irrigants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Load"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Endodontics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Needles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Therapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28650788", "10.17796/1053-4628-41.4.284"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
