Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyzes were performed to characterize the as-made NP. Optimal values of operating parameters in NP/PDS and NP/O<sub>3</sub> processes were obtained. The OFX (10\u00a0mgL<sup>-1</sup>) removal efficiency and molar ratio of OFX: oxidant in NP/PDS and NP/O<sub>3</sub>processes were 92%, 0.1:11 and 89%, 0.1:9, respectively. Although the synergistic effect was observed in both systems, it was more significant in the NP/PDS. The results of free radical tracing showed that HO<sup>\u2022</sup>and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> had the more contribution in NP/O<sub>3</sub> and NP/PDS systems for OFX degradation, respectively. In this way, the OFX removal mechanism was the effective release of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from the NP in the electro-activation of O<sub>3</sub> and PDS. Moreover, the effect of electrocoagulation process on OFX removal was negligible. The as-made NP overcame the disadvantages of iron electrode corrosion and iron sludge production in the Fe-based classical electro-activation processes. Overall, the performance of the synthesized NP in the OFX oxidation was very successful in terms of sustainability, Fe<sup>2+</sup>distribution, removal efficiency, energy consumption and PDS or O<sub>3</sub> activation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
