Periodic measurements of photosynthesis, dark respiration, through-fall and soil solution chemistry, and annual measurements of the weight of plant parts were made. Experimental treatments caused few and minor effects on above- or below-ground growth of the seedlings, even after three growing seasons. There were trends for reduced photosynthesis in trees exposed to elevated concentrations of ozone and increased photosynthesis in those exposed to the lowest pH simulated rain treatment. The chemistries of soil-solutions and through-fall were not altered significantly by treatment. Although major effects were not observed, sugar maple may respond to exposures that take place over a significant part of its life cycle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY 14853-1801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laurence", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohut", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amundson", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weinstein", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "MacLean", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091392", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)00105-0", "0269749195001050"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
