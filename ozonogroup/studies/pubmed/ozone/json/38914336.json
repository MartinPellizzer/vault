Among all wildfires in New Mexico in 2022, six wildfires were selected for our study based on the size of the burn area and their proximity to populated areas. These fires accounted for approximately 90\u00a0% of the total burn area in New Mexico in 2022. We used a regional chemical transport model and data-fusion technique to quantify the contribution of these six wildfires (April 6 to August 22) on particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>: diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcm) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, as well as the associated health impacts from short-term exposure. We estimated that these six wildfires emitted 152 thousand tons of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 287 thousand tons of volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere. We estimated that the average daily wildfire smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> across New Mexico was 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, though 1\u00a0h maximum exceeded 120\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> near Santa Fe. Average wildfire smoke maximum daily average 8-h O<sub>3</sub> (MDA8-O<sub>3</sub>) contribution was 0.2\u00a0ppb during the study period over New Mexico. However, over the state 1\u00a0h maximum smoke O<sub>3</sub> exceeded 60\u00a0ppb in some locations near Santa Fe. Estimated all-cause excess mortality attributable to short term exposure to wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> and MDA8-O<sub>3</sub> from these six wildfires were 18 (95\u00a0% Confidence Interval (CI), 15-21) and 4 (95\u00a0% CI: 3-6) deaths. Additionally, we estimate that wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> was responsible for 171 (95\u00a0%: 124-217) excess cases of asthma emergency department visits. Our findings underscore the impact of wildfires on air quality and human health risks, which are anticipated to intensify with global warming, even as local anthropogenic emissions decline."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "LastName": "Maji", "ForeName": "Kamal J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Ford", "ForeName": "Bonne", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zongrun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yongtao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Earth Science, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, USA."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Leiqiu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Mexico Environmental Public Health Tracking, Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau, Epidemiology and Response Division, New Mexico Department of Health, Santa Fe, NM, USA."}], "LastName": "Langer", "ForeName": "Chelsea Eastman", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Mexico Environmental Public Health Tracking, Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau, Epidemiology and Response Division, New Mexico Department of Health, Santa Fe, NM, USA."}], "LastName": "Hawkinson", "ForeName": "Colin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Mexico Environmental Public Health Tracking, Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau, Epidemiology and Response Division, New Mexico Department of Health, Santa Fe, NM, USA."}], "LastName": "Paladugu", "ForeName": "Srikanth", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Mexico Environmental Public Health Tracking, Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau, Epidemiology and Response Division, New Mexico Department of Health, Santa Fe, NM, USA."}], "LastName": "Moraga-McHaley", "ForeName": "Stephanie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Mexico Environmental Public Health Tracking, Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau, Epidemiology and Response Division, New Mexico Department of Health, Santa Fe, NM, USA."}], "LastName": "Woods", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Vansickle", "ForeName": "Melissa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Uejio", "ForeName": "Christopher K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Maichak", "ForeName": "Courtney", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Sablan", "ForeName": "Olivia", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Magzamen", "ForeName": "Sheryl", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Pierce", "ForeName": "Jeffrey R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA.
