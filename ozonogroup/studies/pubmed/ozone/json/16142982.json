The formation of atomic oxygen and ozone during irradiation in air by V-UV photons results in the transformation of PDMS to silicon oxide. The irradiated surfaces were studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry. The measurements revealed the formation of a rough, i.e., between 11 and 20 nm, oxidized surface layer and a decrease of the total layer thickness. The thickness of the oxidized layer decreased for a given PDMS thickness when the polymer was irradiated for longer times and/or higher intensities. The composition of the oxidized layer after irradiation was not uniform through the layer and consisted of a mixture of original polymer and silicon bonded to three or four oxygen atoms (SiOx). The refractive index n determined by ellipsometry reaches a value similar to values reported for SiO2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Energy Research Department, Paul-Scherrer-Institut, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graubner", "ForeName": "Vera-Maria", "Initials": "VM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clemens", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gutberlet", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00f6tz", "ForeName": "R\u00fcdiger", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lippert", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nuyken", "ForeName": "Oskar", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schnyder", "ForeName": "Bernhard", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wokaun", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16142982", "10.1021/la051086i"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
