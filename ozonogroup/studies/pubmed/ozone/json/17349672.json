A parameter Rct, representing the ratio of the *OH-exposure to the ozone-exposure, was measured using a method involving a low concentration of p-chlorobenzoic acid as a *OH-probe compound during the ozonation. By assuming that Rct is a constant value at a given pH, the second order rate constants of the alkylphenol reaction with hydroxyl radicals were determined as 1.4(+/-0.2) x 10(10) and 1.1(+/-0.2) x 10(10) M(-1) s(-1) for OP and NP, respectively. The proportions of each alkylphenol degraded by direct molecular ozone reaction and indirect hydroxyl radical reaction were predicted at different pH values. The contribution of indirect *OH reactions with each AP was found to represent over 50% of the total degradation for pH approximately 7, and the contribution increases substantially with pH>7."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Water Resource Engineering, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College, London SW7 2AZ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ning", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "Nigel J D", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yanping", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "octylphenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79F6A2ILP5", "NameOfSubstance": "nonylphenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17349672", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.01.056", "S0045-6535(07)00151-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
