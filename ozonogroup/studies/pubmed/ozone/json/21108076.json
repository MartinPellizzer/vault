On the contrary and increasingly, novel food processing methods, such as high pressure or microwaves, imply that both packaging and foodstuff undergo the stabilization treatment. Moreover, novel treatments (UV light, irradiation, ozone, cold plasma) are specifically used for disinfection and sterilization of the packaging material itself. Therefore, in the last several years a number of papers have focused on the effects of these new treatments on food-packaging interactions with a special emphasis on chemical migration and safety concerns. New packaging materials merged on the market with specific interest regarding the environment (i.e. bio-sourced materials) or mechanical and barrier properties (i.e. nanocomposites packaging materials). It is time to evaluate the knowledge about how these in-package food technologies affect food/packaging interactions, and especially for novel biodegradable and/or active materials. This article presents the effect of high pressure treatment, microwave heating, irradiation, UV-light, ozone and, cold plasma treatment on food/packaging interactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universite Montpellier, France. guillard@univ-montp2.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guillard", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mauricio-Iglesias", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gontard", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanocomposites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21108076", "10.1080/10408390903001768", "930097206"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
