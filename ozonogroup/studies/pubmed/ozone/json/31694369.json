Fused Colloidal Nanopatterning combines directed self-assembly and controlled fusing of spherical colloidal nanoparticles. The two-step approach first patterns a surface covered with hydrogen silsesquioxane, an electron beam resist, forming traps into which the colloidal gold nanoparticles self-assemble. Second, the patterned nanoparticles are controllably fused to form plasmon resonators of any 2D designed shape. The heights and widths of the plasmon resonators are determined by the diameter of the nanoparticle building blocks, which can be well below 10 nm. By performing the fusing step with UV ozone and heat exposure, we demonstrate that the process is easily scalable to cover large areas on silicon wafers with designed gold nanostructures. The procedure neither requires adhesion layers nor a lift-off process, making it ideally suited for plasmonics, in comparison with regular electron beam lithography. We use monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy and boundary element method simulations to demonstrate that the designed plasmon resonators are directly tunable via the pattern design. We foresee future expansion of this approach for applications such as plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis and for large-scale patterning where chemical, optical, or confinement properties require sub-10 nm metal lines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asbahi", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahfoud", "ForeName": "Zackaria", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dolmanan", "ForeName": "Surani B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wenya", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0929-7723"], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Zhaogang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6980-5857"], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "FuKe", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3172-041X"], "LastName": "Saifullah", "ForeName": "Mohammad S M", "Initials": "MSM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tripathy", "ForeName": "Sudhiranjan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chong", "ForeName": "Karen S L", "Initials": "KSL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way , 138634 , Singapore."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering , National University of Singapore , 9 Engineering Drive 1 , 117575 Singapore."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8717-7655"], "LastName": "Bosman", "ForeName": "Michel", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31694369", "10.1021/acsami.9b15780"]}}]}
