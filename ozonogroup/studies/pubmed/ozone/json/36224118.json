In this study, the relationships between the near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration and meteorological elements (high- and low-level) in Foshan from 2014 to 2017 were analyzed, and the concentration forecasting equation was established, tested, and applied. The results showed that the near-surface O<sub>3</sub> changed closely related to high- and low-level meteorological elements. Meteorological elements such as temperature and sunshine hours were significantly positively correlated with O<sub>3</sub> concentration, whereas relative humidity, total (low) cloud cover, and wind speed were negatively correlated with O<sub>3</sub>. Heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution often occurred with meteorological conditions of low wind speed, sunny days and few clouds, low relative humidity, longer sunshine time, and higher temperature. The definitions of high-concentration O<sub>3</sub> potential index (HOPI) and wind direction index (WDI) in the Foshan area could better characterize the meteorological conditions of O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Considering 13 meteorological elements, such as HOPI and WDI at different heights, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration forecasting equation in the Foshan area was established using multi-indicator stacking and multiple stepwise regression methods. Using the 2018 data, it was found that the correlation coefficient <i>R</i> between the simulated values and the measured values reached 0.82, and the forecast equation had a good fitting effect and predictability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Meteorological Bureau, Foshan 528000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Observation and Research Station for Climate Environment and Air Quality Change in the Pearl River Estuary, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pearl River Delta Center for Environmental Meteorology Prediction and Warning, Guangdong Ecological Meteorology Center, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Meteorological Bureau, Foshan 528000, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Hao-Bo", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Ecology and Environmental Monitoring Station of Guangdong Province, Foshan 528000, China."}], "LastName": "Situ", "ForeName": "Shu-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Meteorological Bureau, Foshan 528000, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yin-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Meteorological Bureau, Foshan 528000, China."}], "LastName": "Bu", "ForeName": "Qiao-Li", "Initials": "QL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Meteorological Bureau, Foshan 528000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Observation and Research Station for Climate Environment and Air Quality Change in the Pearl River Estuary, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Meteorological Bureau, Foshan 528000, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Qiao-Ying", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36224118", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202112017"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
