A super hybrid rice cultivar II-you 084 with 3 spacing levels, low plant density (LD, 16 hills per m2), medium (MD, 24 hills per m2) and high plant density (HD, 32 hills per m2), was grown in the field at current and elevated ozone concentrations (current \u00d7 1.5). The results were as follows: Elevated ozone significantly reduced leaf SPAD value of UI-you 084 by 6%, 11% and 13%, at 63, 77, and 86 days after transplanting, respectively. The declines in leaf net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate at filling stage increased significantly on ozone stress over time. Ozone stress decreased dry matter production of rice by 46% from heading stage to plant maturity, thus reduced biomass yield by 25%. Elevated ozone decreased the concentration and accumulation of soluble carbohydrate and starch in stem of II-you 084 at jointing, heading and plant maturity, but significantly increased the dry matter transportation rate. No significant interaction was observed between ozone and planting density for photosynthesis, dry matter production and non-structural carbohydrate of rice. The above results indicated that elevated ozone reduced photosynthesis and growth of rice II-you 084 at late growth stage, which had no relationship with planting density."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Shang-kun", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pan-lin", "Initials": "PL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun-xia", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jian-guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lian-xin", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-long", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25997182"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
