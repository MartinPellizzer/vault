Nitromethane was recently found as a ubiquitous ozone byproduct in wastewater, and the key intermediate toward chloropicrin during subsequent secondary disinfection of ozonated wastewater effluent with chlorine. However, many utilities have switched from free chlorine to chloramines as a secondary disinfectant. The reaction mechanism and kinetics of nitromethane transformation by chloramines, unlike those for free chlorine, are unknown. In this work, the kinetics, mechanism, and products of nitromethane chloramination were studied. The expected principal product was chloropicrin, because chloramines are commonly assumed to react similarly to, although more slowly than, free chlorine. Different molar yields of chloropicrin were observed under acidic, neutral, and basic conditions, and surprisingly, transformation products other than chloropicrin were found. Monochloronitromethane and dichloronitromethane were detected at basic pH, and the mass balance was initially poor at neutral pH. Much of the missing mass was later attributed to nitrate formation, from a newly identified pathway involving monochloramine reacting as a nucleophile rather than a halogenating agent, through a presumed S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism. The study indicates that nitromethane chloramination, unlike chlorination, is likely to produce a range of products, whose speciation is a function of pH and reaction time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, United States."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jiaming Lily", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, United States."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Euna", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, United States."}], "LastName": "Cardosa", "ForeName": "Georgia B", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5599-2540"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, United States."}], "LastName": "McCurry", "ForeName": "Daniel L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I4JTX7Z7U2", "NameOfSubstance": "chloropicrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RU5WG8C3F4", "NameOfSubstance": "nitromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37191694", "10.1021/acs.est.2c09821"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
