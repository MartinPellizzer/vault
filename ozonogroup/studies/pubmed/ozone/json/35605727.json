Due to the convection-enhanced mass transport and fast radial diffusion inside the small pores of REM cathodes, the rate of cathodic O<sub>3</sub> reduction to ozonide radicals (O<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) was significantly enhanced, while the further cathodic O<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> reduction to oxygen was inhibited during the flow-through O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis process compared to the conventional mixed-tank O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis process. Consequently, more hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) were formed from O<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> decay in water during the flow-through O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis process than the mixed-tank O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis process. Corresponding to the higher \u2022OH yields from cathodic O<sub>3</sub> reduction, the flow-through O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis process substantially enhanced the abatement kinetics and efficiency of para-benzoic acid (pCBA, a model compound of ozone-resistant micropollutant) in a groundwater than conventional ozonation and the mixed-tank O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis process. These results suggest that the flow-through O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis process may provide a competitive treatment technology for micropollutant abatement in water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
