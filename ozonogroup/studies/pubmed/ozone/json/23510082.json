The formation of O-atoms was measured behind reflected shock waves by using atomic resonance absorption spectrometry (ARAS). The experiments span a T-range, 819 K \u2264 T \u2264 1166 K, at pressures 0.13 bar \u2264 P \u2264 0.6 bar. Unimolecular rate theory provides an excellent representation of the falloff characteristics from the present and literature data on ozone decomposition at high temperatures. The present decomposition study on ozone permits its usage as a thermal source for O-atoms allowing measurements for, O + CH3OC(O)OCH3 \u2192 OH + CH3OC(O)OCH2 [A]. Reflected shock tube experiments monitoring the formation and decay of O-atoms were performed on reaction A using mixtures of O3 and CH3OC(O)OCH3, (DMC), in Kr bath gas over the T-range, 862 K \u2264 T \u2264 1167 K, and pressure range, 0.15 bar \u2264 P \u2264 0.33 bar. A detailed model was used to fit the O-atom temporal profile to obtain experimental rate constants for reaction A. Rate constants from the present experiments for O + DMC can be represented by the Arrhenius expression: kA(T) = 2.70 \u00d7 10(-11) exp(-2725 K/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (862-1167 K). Transition state theory calculations employing CCSD(T)/cc-pv\u221ez//M06-2X/cc-pvtz energetics and molecular properties for reaction A are in good agreement with the experimental rate constants. The theoretical rate constants can be well represented (to within \u00b110%) over the 500-2000 K temperature range by: kA(T) = 1.87 \u00d7 10(-20)T(2.924) exp(-2338 K/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The present study represents the first experimental measurement and theoretical study on this bimolecular reaction which is of relevance to the high temperature oxidation of DMC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory , Argonne, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peukert", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sivaramakrishnan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michael", "ForeName": "J V", "Initials": "JV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23510082", "10.1021/jp400613p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
