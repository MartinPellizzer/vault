Measuring NO metabolites is essential to studying NO activity both at vascular levels and in other tissues, especially in the experimental settings where exogenous NO is administered. Ozone-based chemiluminescence assays allow precise measurements of NO and NO metabolites in both fluids (including plasma, tissue homogenates, cell cultures) and gas mixtures (e.g., exhaled breath). NO reacts with ozone to generate nitrogen dioxide in an excited state. The consequent light emission allows photodetection and the generation of an electric signal reflecting the NO content of the sample. Aliquots from the same sample can be used to measure specific NO metabolites, such as nitrate, nitrite, S-nitrosothiols, and iron-nitrosyl complexes. In addition, NO consumed by cell-free hemoglobin is also quantified with chemiluminescence analysis. An illustration of all these techniques is provided."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School."}], "LastName": "Di Fenza", "ForeName": "Raffaele", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Binglan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School."}], "LastName": "Carroll", "ForeName": "Ryan W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; lberra@mgh.harvard.edu."}], "LastName": "Berra", "ForeName": "Lorenzo", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R21 HL130956", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35253799", "10.3791/63107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
