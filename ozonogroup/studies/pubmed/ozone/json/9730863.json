Ozone exposure damaged cilia and caused significant cell loss. Immunocytochemical localization and quantification of the beta1 subunit in the remaining attached cells using scanning laser cytometry demonstrated time-dependent changes in beta1 distribution in response to ozone. Although no changes were detected immediately after exposure, beta1 immunoreactivity increased 23 +/- 5% and 66 +/- 6% at 6 and 24 h, respectively. The increased immunostaining was localized at the apical surfaces and, to a lesser extent, at cell-cell contacts of cultured cells. Furthermore, integrin redistribution was not due to increased messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and protein synthesis because levels of beta1 mRNA and newly synthesized beta1 protein did not change after ozone exposure. However, immunoprecipitation analysis of beta1 integrins in lysates from equal numbers of cells showed that ozone-exposed cells contained 90 +/- 15% more total beta1 subunit at 24 h after exposure. In addition, our results demonstrated the presence of the alpha5beta1 integrin complex in bronchial epithelial cells and that the detergent-soluble amount of its associated beta1 subunit increased 60 +/- 10% in lysates of ozone-exposed cells. In conclusion, ozone altered cellular distribution of beta1 integrins in the remaining attached cells subsequent to cell injury and loss. The changes in beta1 distribution might be due to increased detergent extractibility of beta1 integrins rather than a real increase in the synthesis of beta1 integrins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health; Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and Department of Pathology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7234, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jabbour", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Altman", "ForeName": "L C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wight", "ForeName": "T N", "Initials": "TN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luchtel", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES07033", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-50580", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8917225", "ISSNLinking": "1044-1549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Integrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Integrins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca nemestrina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Confocal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Precipitin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9730863", "10.1165/ajrcmb.19.3.2961"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
