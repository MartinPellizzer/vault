While environmental factors have been linked to the development of KD, the specific role of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution in triggering the disease onset remains uncertain. This study aimed to examine the associations between short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure and KD onset in children. Utilizing a satellite-based model with a spatial resolution of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0km, we matched 1808 KD patients (out of a total of 6115 eligible individuals) to pre-onset ozone exposures based on their home addresses in East China between 2013 and 2020. Our findings revealed a significant association of O<sub>3</sub> exposure with KD onset on the day of onset (lag 0 day). However, this association attenuated and became statistically insignificant on lag 1 and lag 2 days. Each interquartile range (52.32\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration at lag 0 day was associated with a 16.2% (95% CI: 3.6%, 30.3%) increased risk of KD onset. The E-R curve for O<sub>3</sub> exhibited a plateau at low concentrations and then increased rapidly at concentrations \u226575\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Notably, these associations were stronger in male children, younger children (<2 years of age) and patients experiencing KD onset during the warm season. This study provides novel epidemiological evidence indicating that short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure is associated with an increased risk of childhood KD onset. These findings emphasized the importance of considering this environmental risk factor in KD prevention strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
