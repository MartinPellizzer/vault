Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of Stone-Wales-like defects on the structural and electronic properties of (i) ideal tubes and (ii) tubes in the presence of ozone. Our results show that structural deformations induced on the pure carbon nanotubes by Stone-Wales defects are similar, as expected, to those induced on graphite; for the (10,0) tube, the semiconducting character is kept, though with a small reduction of the band gap. As for the ozone adsorption, the process on ideal nanotubes is most likely physisorption, though slightly stronger if compared to other previously studied molecules and consistent with the strong oxydizing nature of O(3). However, when ozone adsorbs on Stone-Wales defects, a strong chemisorption occurs, leading to relevant structural relaxations and to the formation of a CO covalent bond; this is consistent with experimental observations of CO functional groups, as well as of the liberation of CO gas phase and of the formation of C vacancies, thus explaining the consumption of the nanotube film upon ozone exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2004 American Institute of Physics."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INFM and Department of Physics, University of L'Aquila, 67010 Coppito, L'Aquila, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Picozzi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santucci", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lozzi", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valentini", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delley", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15267620", "10.1063/1.1669381"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
