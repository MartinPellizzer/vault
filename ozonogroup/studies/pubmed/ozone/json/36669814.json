Here we assessed the genotoxic risk of UVB and UVA exposure for tadpoles from open ponds in southern Brazil, a mid-latitude region influenced by stratospheric ozone depletion. Daily UV doses were measured on the surface of a pond in Taim Ecological Station (TAIM; 32\u00b049'24''S; 52\u00b038'31''W) on a cloudless summer day to predict the worst-case scenario for UV-induced DNA damage. Pond descriptors were related to the use of microhabitats by Boana pulchella tadpoles in two ponds over the climate seasons of 2013 and 2014. Our results indicate that shaded microhabitats were more frequent than unshaded ones in autumn, winter, and spring but not in summer. Hence, the penetration of UV radiation into the water of unshaded microhabitats was evaluated through laboratory experiments with artificial UV sources and pond water samples. Physical and biological sensors were applied in the experiments to measure the incident UV radiation and its genotoxic action. By integrating field and laboratory data, we demonstrate that low doses of biologically effective UV radiation reached the tadpoles in autumn, winter, spring, and early summer due to a high proportion of shaded microhabitats and a high concentration of solids in unshaded microhabitats. However, the relative reduction of shaded microhabitats jointly with a declining water level in late summer may have exposed tadpoles to high UV doses. Our experiments also indicate that solar UVB radiation, but not UVA, is primarily responsible for the induction of DNA pyrimidine dimers in organisms living under the surface of aquatic ecosystems. The present work highlights the determinant role of wetland descriptors for minimizing the genotoxic potential of UV radiation and its consequences for amphibians."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
