The change in reactivity was investigated as a function of the myristic acid concentration in these 2 micron particles. For pure oleic acid aerosol, the reactive ozone uptake coefficient, gamma, was found to be 3.4 (+/-0.3) x 10(-4) after taking secondary reactions into account. At the myristic acid crystallization point, where only 2.5% of the particle is in the solid phase, the uptake coefficient was reduced to 9.7 (+/-1.0) x 10(-5). This dramatic drop in the uptake coefficient is explained by the presence of a crystalline monolayer of myristic acid, through which ozone diffusion is reduced by several orders of magnitude, relative to liquid oleic acid. Scanning electron microscope images of the mixed particles confirm that the particle surface is crystalline when the myristic acid mole fraction exceeds 0.125. The findings of these experiments illustrate that particle morphology is important to understanding the reactivity of species in a mixed particle. The decay of myristic acid during the course of ozonolysis is explained in terms of a reaction with stabilized Criegee intermediates, which attack the acidic groups of the oleic and myristic acids with equal rate constants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3290, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nash", "ForeName": "David G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tolocka", "ForeName": "Michael P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baer", "ForeName": "Tomas", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0I3V7S25AW", "NameOfSubstance": "Myristic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Myristic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17001415", "10.1039/b609855j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
