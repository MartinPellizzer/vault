Rice, a widely grown crop in China, was investigated in field-established, open-top chambers. Four treatments were used: charcoal-filtered air (CF), non-charcoal-filtered air (NF), and charcoal-filtered air with two levels of additional ozone (O3-1 and O3-2). The AOT40s (accumulated hourly mean ozone concentration above 40 ppbv) were 0, 0.91, 23.24, and 39.28 ppmv x h for treatment of CF, NF, O3-1, and O3-2, respectively. The rice height and biomass were reduced in the elevated ozone concentration. Less organic matter partitioning to roots under the elevated ozone significantly decreased rice root activity. The yield loss was 14.3% and 20.2% under O3-1 and O3-2 exposure, respectively. This was largely caused by a reduction in grain weight per panicle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China. chenchen323@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaoke", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhaozhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Feixiang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Xiaonan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wenrui", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18595399", "10.1016/s1001-0742(08)60050-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
