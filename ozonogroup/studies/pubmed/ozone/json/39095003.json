Reflectance spectroscopy of vegetation can identify and detect unique spectral signatures of different abiotic and biotic stressors. In this study, we tested the use of hyperspectral leaf reflectance to detect O<sub>3</sub> stress in alder, beech, birch, crab apple, and oak saplings exposed to five long-term O<sub>3</sub> regimes (ranging from daily target maxima of 30\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub> to 110\u00a0ppb). Hyperspectral reflectance varied significantly between O<sub>3</sub> treatments, both in whole spectra analysis and when simplified to representative components. O<sub>3</sub> damage had a multivariate impact on leaf reflectance, underpinned by changes in pigment balance, water content and structural composition. Vegetation indices derived from reflectance which characterised the visible green peak were able to differentiate between O<sub>3</sub> treatments. Iterative normalised difference spectral indices across the hyperspectral wavelength range were correlated to visual damage scores to identify significant wavelengths for O<sub>3</sub> damage detection. We propose a new Ozone Damage Index (OzDI), which characterises the reflectance peak in the shortwave infrared region and outperformed existing vegetation indices in terms of correlation to O<sub>3</sub> treatment. These results demonstrate the potential application of hyperspectral reflectance as a high throughput method of O<sub>3</sub> damage detection in a range of common broadleaf. species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
