Children with hay fever complaints are at considerable risk of developing pollen asthma. Population-based data on their natural history is urgently needed.", "A longitudinal cohort study was conducted over four years in six rural towns in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. A questionnaire with questions taken from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in childhood (ISAAC) was filled in every spring and autumn. Hay fever complaints, asthma defining symptoms and new doctors' diagnosis of hay fever and asthma were recorded. Additionally a skin prick test with pollen allergens was performed every autumn.", "In 1996, 19.7% of 1101 elementary school children (age: 8.1-9.9 years (5-95%)) were found to be sensitized to pollen and 8.7% had already been diagnosed as having hay fever. In a pooled analysis of 2478 children-summers, children with positive pollen sensitization had a significantly higher risk of developing hay fever symptoms (2.63; 2.17-3.10 odds ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI)) and of being diagnosed as suffering from hay fever (7.88; 4.70-13.20). Furthermore, although their OR for the development of asthma symptoms during the pollen season was 3.88 (2.48-6.07 CI), it was only 0.69 (0.24-2.01 CI) for doctors' diagnosis of pollen asthma.", "Children of elementary school age with pollen sensitization and a history of hay fever are at considerable risk of getting pollen asthma, but they are not quickly diagnosed as such. Specific immunotherapy might be a means of preventing asthma completely in such a situation. Our data helps to estimate the sample size for intervention studies of this kind."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Children's Hospital Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riedinger", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuehr", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Strauch", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ihorst", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forster", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "CollectiveName": "Ozone Working Group"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "7804028", "ISSNLinking": "0105-4538"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Welfare"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confidence Intervals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Sounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "School Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12028113", "10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.12945.x", "1o2945"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
