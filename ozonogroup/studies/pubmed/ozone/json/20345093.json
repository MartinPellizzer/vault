Recent studies highlighted the ubiquitous occurrence of natural ClO4(-) in the environment including wet deposition in the United States. Limited studies have investigated potential mechanisms responsible for natural ClO4(-) production in the environment. These studies have neither addressed the influence of relevant reaction conditions nor have they evaluated the rates of ClO4(-) production. The purpose of this study was to determine the comparative yields and rates of ClO4(-) production from O3 mediated oxidation of Cl(-), OCl(-), ClO2(-), ClO3(-), and ClO2. The influence of reactant (O3 and ClOx(-)) concentration and pH were evaluated. The comparative rate and efficiency of ClO4(-) production is generally greater for higher oxidation states of Cl (2.7 to 0.5% for ClO2(-)/ClO2 and 0.02 to 0.005% for OCl(-)/HOCl oxidation) with the notable exception of ClO3(-) which does not react with O3. The very slow rate of ClO4(-) production from Cl(-) ( approximately 20 x 10(-9) mM min(-1)) even at elevated O3 and Cl(-) concentrations implies negligible potential for anthropogenic ClO4(-) formation in process units of water/wastewater systems that use O3 for treatment. Based on results of ClO4(-) formation from tested Cl species and available literature, we propose a potential formation pathway for ClO4(-) from Cl(-) with emphasis on the role of ClO2 and higher oxy-chlorine radicals/intermediates (e.g., Cl2O6) in its formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409-1023, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Balaji", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Todd A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Redder", "ForeName": "Aaron", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jackson", "ForeName": "W Andrew", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Perchlorates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Perchlorates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20345093", "10.1021/es903065f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
