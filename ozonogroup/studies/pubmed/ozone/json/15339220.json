Numerous investigations have demonstrated that the effect of UV-B enhancements on plants includes reduction in grain yield, alteration in species competition, susceptibility to disease and changes in plant structure and pigmentation. Many experiments examining UV-B radiation effects on plants have been conducted in growth chambers or greenhouses. It has been questioned whether the effect of UV-B radiation on plants can be extrapolated to field responses from indoor studies because of the unnaturally high ratios of UV-B/ultraviolet-A radiation (320-400 nm) and UV-B/photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in many indoor studies. Field studies on UV-B radiation effect on plants have been recommended to use the UV and PAR irradiance provided by natural light. This study reports the growth and yield responses of a maize crop exposed to enhanced UV-B radiation and the UV-B effects on maize seed qualities under field conditions. Enhanced UV-B radiation caused a significant reduction in the dry matter accumulation and the maize yield in turn was affected. With increased UV-B radiation the flavonoid accumulation in maize leaves increased and the contents of chlorophyll a, b and (a + b) of maize leaves were reduced. The levels of protein, sugar and starch of maize seed decreased with enhanced UV-B radiation, whereas the level of lysine increased with enhanced UV-B radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA UV-B Monitoring and Research Program, Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory, Colorado State University, 419 Canyon Avenue, Fort Collins, CO 80521, USA. wgao@uvb.nrel.colostate.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Youfei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slusser", "ForeName": "James R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heisler", "ForeName": "Gordon M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "Richard H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jianqiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Douliang", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15339220", "10.1562/2004-05-03-RA-156.1", "2004-05-03-RA-156"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
