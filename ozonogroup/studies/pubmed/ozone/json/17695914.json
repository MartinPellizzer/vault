In particular, concentrations of two secondary pollutants, ozone and particulate matter, are often above regulated levels and can be dependent on emissions from upwind states. Here, impacts of statewide emissions on concentrations of local and downwind states' ozone and fine particulate matter are simulated for three seasonal periods in the eastern United States using a regional Eulerian photochemical model. Impacts of ground level NO(x) (e.g., mobile and area sources), elevated NO(x) (e.g., power plants and large industrial sources), and SO2 emissions are examined. An average of 77% of each state's ozone and PM(2.5) concentrations that are sensitive to the emissions evaluated here are found to be caused by emissions from other states. Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, Kentucky, and West Virginia are shown to have high concentrations of ozone and PM(2.5) caused by interstate emissions. When weighted by population, New York receives increased interstate contributions to these pollutants and contributions to ozone from local emissions are generally higher. When accounting for emission rates, combined states from the western side of the modeling domain and individual states such as Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, and Georgia are major contributors to interstate ozone. Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Illinois are the major contributors to interstate PM(2.5). When accounting for an equivalent mass of emissions, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and Alabama contribute large fractions of these pollutants to other states."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, USA. michelle_bergin@dnr.state.ga.us"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bergin", "ForeName": "Michelle S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shih", "ForeName": "Jhih-Shyang", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krupnick", "ForeName": "Alan J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boylan", "ForeName": "James W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkinson", "ForeName": "James G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Odman", "ForeName": "M Talat", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "Armistead G", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17695914", "10.1021/es062302s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
