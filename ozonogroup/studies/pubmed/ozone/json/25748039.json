We evaluated nitrite concentrations in whole, submandibular, and parotid saliva, as well as in whole blood, erythrocytes, and plasma of healthy volunteers and patients with chronic periodontitis.", "Data obtained for the PD and control groups were compared before and 3 months after periodontal therapy.", "At baseline, stimulated whole saliva nitrite concentration was lower in PD patients (mean=57.3 \u00b1 9.8 \u03bcmol/L) as compared with healthy individuals (92.5 \u00b1 13.6 \u03bcmol/L, P<0.05). PD and periodontal treatment did not affect submandibular or parotid saliva nitrite concentrations. PD patients presented higher baseline whole blood nitrite concentration (238.4 \u00b1 45.7 \u03bcmol/L) as compared with values recorded 3 months after therapy (141.3 \u00b1 20.1 nmol/L, P<0.05). PD patients' erythrocytes exhibited higher baseline nitrite concentration (573.1 \u00b1 97.8 nmol/L) as compared with three months after therapy (298.7 \u00b1 52.1 nmol/L, P<0.05).
