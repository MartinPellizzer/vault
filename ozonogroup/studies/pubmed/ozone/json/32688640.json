They can tolerate multiple desiccation-rehydration events over the summer growing season. As a result of recent ozone depletion, such mosses may also be exposed to ultraviolet-B radiation while desiccated. The ultraviolet-B susceptibility of Antarctic moss species was examined in a laboratory experiment that tested whether desiccated or hydrated mosses accumulated more DNA damage under enhanced ultraviolet-B radiation. Accumulation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone dimers was measured in moss samples collected from the field and then exposed to ultraviolet-B radiation in either a desiccated or hydrated state. Two cosmopolitan species, Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. and Bryum pseudotriquetrum (Hedw.) Gaertn., B.Mey. & Scherb, were protected from DNA damage when desiccated, with accumulation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers reduced by at least 60% relative to hydrated moss. The endemic Schistidium antarctici (Cardot) L.I. Savicz & Smirnova accumulated more DNA damage than the other species and desiccation was not protective in this species. The cosmopolitan species remarkable ability to tolerate high ultraviolet-B exposure, especially in the desiccated state, suggests they may be better able to tolerate continued elevated ultraviolet-B radiation than the endemic species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Conservation Biology, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turnbull", "ForeName": "Johanna D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Conservation Biology, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leslie", "ForeName": "Simon J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Conservation Biology, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "Sharon A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Funct Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101154361", "ISSNLinking": "1445-4416"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32688640", "10.1071/FP08286", "FP08286"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
