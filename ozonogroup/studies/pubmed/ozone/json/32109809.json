Their recalcitrant nature makes them difficult to be removed from the environment using conventional remediation strategies. This study hypothesized that, upon continuous operation, biofiltration of OSPW in fixed-bed biofilm reactors would allow the development of NA-degrading microbial community within the biofilter following successful removal. Both raw and ozonated OSPW were treated in the biofilters and changes in microbial community were tested via 16S/18S amplicon sequencing and metatranscriptomics. Through switch from suspended growth to attached growth, a shift in indigenous microbial community was seen following by an increase in alpha diversity. Concomitantly, improved degradation of NAs was monitored, i.e., 35.8% and 69.4% of NAs were removed from raw and ozonated OSPW, respectively. Metatranscriptomics analysis suggested the presence of genes involved in the degradation of organic acids and petroleum-related compounds. Specifically, functional abundance of aromatic compounds' metabolism improved from 0.05% to 0.76%; whereas abundance of benzoate transport and degradation pathway increased from 0.04% to 0.64%. These changes conclude that continuous operation of OSPW in the bioreactors was in favor of shaping the overall microbiome towards better NA degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
