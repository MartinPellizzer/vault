For physical absorption, mass transfer rate increased with liquid velocity and the ozone concentration in the gas. Gas flow rate was little affected when the velocity was larger than the critical value, which was 6.1 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup>m/s in this study. For chemical absorption, the flux was determined by the reaction rate between ozone and the absorbent. Therefore, concentration, species, and pH affected the mass transfer process markedly. For different absorbents, the order of mass transfer rate was the same as the reaction rate constant, which was phenol, sodium nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, and oxalate. Five hydrophobic membranes with various properties were employed and the mass transfer behavior can be described by the Graetz-L\u00e9v\u00e8que equation for the physical absorption process. The results showed the process was controlled by liquid film and the gas phase conditions, and membrane properties did not affect the ozone flux. For the chemical absorption, gas film, membrane and liquid film affected the mass transfer together, and none of them were negligible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Industrial Wastewater Treatment and Resource Recovery, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China and The National Engineering Laboratory for Industrial Wastewater Treatment, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China E-mail: junwang@rcees.ac.cn; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Industrial Wastewater Treatment and Resource Recovery, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China and The National Engineering Laboratory for Industrial Wastewater Treatment, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China E-mail: junwang@rcees.ac.cn; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kuiling", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Industrial Wastewater Treatment and Resource Recovery, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China and The National Engineering Laboratory for Industrial Wastewater Treatment, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China E-mail: junwang@rcees.ac.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Industrial Wastewater Treatment and Resource Recovery, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China and The National Engineering Laboratory for Industrial Wastewater Treatment, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China E-mail: junwang@rcees.ac.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Deyin", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Industrial Wastewater Treatment and Resource Recovery, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China and The National Engineering Laboratory for Industrial Wastewater Treatment, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Beijing 100085, China E-mail: junwang@rcees.ac.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huijuan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Porosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28953462", "10.2166/wst.2017.254"]}}]}
