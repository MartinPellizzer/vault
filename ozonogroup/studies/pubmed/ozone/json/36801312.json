We aimed to estimate the association between maternal exposure to ozone and risk of gestational hypertension and eclampsia in the contiguous United States (US).", "We included 2,393,346 normotensive mothers aged from 18 to 50\u00a0years old who had a live singleton birth documented in the National Vital Statistics system in the US in 2002. We obtained information on gestational hypertension and eclampsia from birth certificates. We estimated daily ozone concentrations from a spatiotemporal ensemble model. We used distributed lag model and logistic regression to estimate the association between monthly ozone exposure and risk of gestational hypertension or eclampsia after adjusting for individual-level covariates and county poverty rate.", "Of the 2,393,346 pregnant women, there were 79,174 women with gestational hypertension and 6034 with eclampsia. A 10 parts per billion (ppb) increase in ozone was associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension over 1-3\u00a0months before conception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.042, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.029, 1.056), 2-3\u00a0months after conception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.058, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.040, 1.077), and 3-5\u00a0months after conception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.031, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.018, 1.044).
