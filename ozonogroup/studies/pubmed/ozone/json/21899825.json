However, due to the fragmentary data on chronic toxicity of ozone produced oxidants (OPO) and its safe concentrations, the daily application of ozone in aquaculture is challenging. To evaluate the chronic effects of sublethal OPO concentrations, juvenile turbot (Psetta maxima, L.) were exposed to OPO concentrations of 0.06, 0.10 and 0.15 mg/l for 21 days. Gills were analysed for histopathological alterations and mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), hsp90 as well as glutathione-S-transferase (gst) were determined in the gills and the liver after 1d, 7d and 21 d. Histopathologic findings confirmed adverse effects at 0.10-0.15 mg/l, but these (necrosis, lamellar clubbing, hypertrophy, hyperplasia) could only be observed after an extended exposure (mostly 21 d), and were considered as irreversible tissue damage. Hsp70 expression in the gills was only significantly increased at the highest OPO concentration (0.15 mg/l) on 1d and 7d, and returned to basic levels until day 21. Hsp90 mRNA was already increased at 0.10mg/l after 1 and 7 days of exposure, and again was comparable to the control group on day 21. In contrast, elevated gst mRNA expression was only observed on day 7 at 0.10mg and 0.15 mg/l. Although similar trends were observed in the liver for all markers, differences were only significant in exceptional cases due to the high individual variation observed. Thus, mRNA expression in the gills rather than in the liver is recommended as a marker to characterize OPO-induced oxidative stress in turbot. It has to be noted that mRNA expression returned to basic levels on day 21 regardless the actual OPO concentration, suggesting a collapse of adaptive mechanisms as a possible explanation for the observed tissue damage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
