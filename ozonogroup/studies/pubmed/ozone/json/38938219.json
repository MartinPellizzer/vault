While previous studies have focused on the effects of treatments such as perming and hair dying on hair porosity, less emphasis has been paid to the effects of harmful environmental factors such as ultraviolet (UV) rays and particulate matter on the porous nature of hair.", "The aim of this study was to bridge this gap by investigating how UV rays and particulate matter affect hair porosity in different ways. Our study could help elucidate how these external factors influence hair health and shed light on previously unknown aspects of hair porosity.", "Hair tresses were bleached, cut into 1\u2009cm-long sections, and stained with methylene blue. The sections were then irradiated with UV light or exposed to particulate matter.", "Bleached hair absorbed more methylene blue than normal hair. UV radiation-induced hair porosity occurred at 3\u2009h after irradiation and increased with time. Particulate matter alone did not affect the porosity of the damaged hair; however, in combination with UV irradiation, it substantially increased hair porosity.", "Environmental challenges such as a depleted ozone layer and increasing pollution may increase hair porosity, which can be prevented by maintaining healthy hair."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
