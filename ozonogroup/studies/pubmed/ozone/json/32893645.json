EJPD is the official journal of the Italian Society of Paediatric Dentistry (SIOI), but its scientific value and diffusion made it an authoritative reference source not only in Europe, but also worldwide. This is the result of the great work and commitment of the Editorial Board, composed by national and international experts, with the collaboration of the Managing Director Giuseppe Marzo and of the editorial staff. The prominent position that EJPD has gained in the international ranking of dental journals, where the top tier is dominated by those that mainly focus on adult patients, rewards its constant pursue of excellence of the scientific approach, giving at the same time great importance to articles dealing with everyday practice. This is the reason why the papers published in the EJPD are so rich in images. Communication through images is paramount for the current generation and generations to come. Digital diagnostic instruments and advanced treatments, 3D technologies, the current concepts of aerosol and no aerosol technique, together with the progress in the field of new dental materials, like bioactive cements for paediatric restorations or new biocompatible technopolymers (milled or 3D printed) for dentofacial orthopaedics and orthodontics are areas of great interest. We believe that our Journal should pay special attention to papers that take into account the overall health and wellness of the child using safe and efficient preventive, therapeutic or comfort techniques (laser, ozone, relative analgesia, caries diagnosis with transillumination, etc), also considering the importance of environmental conditions and promoting the collaboration with other specialists, with a focus on special need patients. EJPD also aims at guiding young paediatric dentists-graduating from postgraduate schools and residency programmes in paediatric dentistry-with a more comprehensive approach to the practical aspects of the profession, while striving to become the global scientific reference point of maternal and child oral care, defending them from the attractive flatteries of the predatory journals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Editor In Chief and the Editorial Board of the European Journal of Paediatric Dentistry."}], "LastName": "Paglia", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Paediatr Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101121881", "ISSNLinking": "1591-996X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Journal Impact Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pediatric Dentistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "37"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32893645", "10.23804/ejpd.2020.21.03.01"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
