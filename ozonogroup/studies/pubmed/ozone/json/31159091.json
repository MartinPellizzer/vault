Treatment procedures included trimming, washing, and the current industry practice of trimming followed by washing. In addition, hot (74 to 87.8\u00b0C at the pipe) water washing and rinsing with ozone (0.3 to 2.3 ppm) or hydrogen peroxide (5%) were applied as intervention treatments. Beef carcasses were deliberately contaminated with bovine fecal material at >4.0 log colony-forming units (CFU)/cm<sup>2</sup> in order to be better able to observe the decontaminating effects of the treatments. Carcasses were visually scored by 2 to 3 trained personnel for the level of gross contamination before and after treatment. Samples (10 by 15 cm, 0.3 to 0.5 cm thick) for microbiological testing were excised as controls or after application of each procedure or intervention and analyzed for aerobic mesophilic plate counts, Escherichia coli Biotype I counts, and presence or absence of Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Average reductions in aerobic plate counts were 1.85 and 2.00 log CFU/cm<sup>2</sup> for the treatments of trimming-washing and hot-water washing, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide and ozone reduced aerobic plate counts by 1.14 and 1.30 log CFU/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. In general, trimming and washing of beef carcasses consistently resulted in low bacterial populations and scores for visible contamination. However, the data also indicated that hot- (74 to 87.8\u00b0C at the pipe) water washing was an effective intervention that reduced bacterial and fecal contamination in a consistent manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Live Stock and Meat Board, Chicago, Illinois 60611."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reagan", "ForeName": "James O", "Initials": "JO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Acuff", "ForeName": "Gary R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buege", "ForeName": "Dennis R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Live Stock and Meat Board, Chicago, Illinois 60611."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buyck", "ForeName": "Marietta J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dickson", "ForeName": "James S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science and Industry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kastner", "ForeName": "Curtis L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science and Industry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marsden", "ForeName": "James L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "J Brad", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Silliker Laboratories Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois 60411."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nickelson", "ForeName": "Ranzell", "Initials": "R", "Suffix": "2nd"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Gary C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sofos", "ForeName": "John N", "Initials": "JN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31159091", "10.4315/0362-028X-59.7.751", "S0362-028X(22)04350-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
