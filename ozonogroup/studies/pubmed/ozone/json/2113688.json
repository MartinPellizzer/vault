A heat wave occurred in July of 1988, with daily maximum temperatures near or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit on 15 consecutive days. During that period there were a total of 694 deaths from all causes in the county, compared with an expected 587 deaths (P less than .01). All 107 excess deaths were of persons ages 65 or older, with the majority (78) occurring to persons older than age 75. Daily mortality was most closely correlated with average temperature from the previous day (R = .49, P less than .01), suggesting the cumulative effects of successive high daytime and night-time temperatures on susceptible persons. Evaluation of a possible effect on mortality of high ambient ozone levels detected in early July suggested that ozone did not contribute to excess mortality during the heat wave. Comparison of the 1988 heat wave with a less intense hot spell of 1973 indicated that excess mortality was less than would have been expected in 1988. The authors speculate that increased public awareness and the wider use of air conditioning over the years may have reduced the lethality of periods of extreme summer temperatures in urban areas. Further research is needed to evaluate this hypothesis completely. Public health officials should continue to monitor weather forecasts for predictions of extended periods of unusual heat and should warn the public to take suitable precautions during such periods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15261."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramlow", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuller", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Public Health Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9716844", "ISSNLinking": "0033-3549"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Death Certificates"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Death, Sudden"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pennsylvania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Res. 1978 Jun;15(3):504-12", "ArticleIdList": ["679906"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1972 Mar;5(1):59-75", "ArticleIdList": ["5032925"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1972 Mar;5(1):1-58", "ArticleIdList": ["4555874"]}, {"Citation": "J Am Geriatr Soc. 1981 Aug;29(8):337-42", "ArticleIdList": ["7264123"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1969 Dec;59(12):2232-42", "ArticleIdList": ["5389506"]}, {"Citation": "JAMA. 1982 Jun 25;247(24):3327-31", "ArticleIdList": ["7087075"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1970 Nov;3(4):277-84", "ArticleIdList": ["5489820"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2113688", "PMC1579995"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
