Impacts were generally similar at both grid resolutions although notable differences were seen in some secondary pollutants (e.g., formaldehyde and peroxyacyl nitrate) near the Rim fire. The modeling system does well at capturing near-fire to regional scale smoke plume transport compared to remotely sensed aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aircraft transect measurements. Plume rise for the Rim fire was well characterized as the modeled plume top was consistent with remotely sensed data and the altitude of aircraft measurements, which were typically made at the top edge of the plume. Aircraft-based lidar suggests O<sub>3</sub> downwind in the Rim fire plume was vertically stratified and tended to be higher at the plume top, while CMAQ estimated a more uniformly mixed column of O<sub>3</sub>. Predicted wildfire ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was overestimated both at the plume top and at nearby rural and urban surface monitors. Photolysis rates were well characterized by the model compared with aircraft measurements meaning aerosol attenuation was reasonably estimated and unlikely contributing to O<sub>3</sub> overestimates at the top of the plume. Organic carbon was underestimated close to the Rim fire compared to aircraft data, but was consistent with nearby surface measurements. Periods of elevated surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> at rural monitors near the Rim fire were not usually coincident with elevated O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.
