The present study was designed to determine the temporal relationships of ozone-induced inflammatory and epithelial responses and their correlation with subsequent MCM in the NTE of rats. Male F344/N rats were exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone, 8 h/day for 1, 2, or 3 days. Two h prior to sacrifice, all the rats were injected intraperitoneally with 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label epithelial cells undergoing DNA synthesis. Rats exposed to ozone for 1 or 2 days were killed 2 h after the exposure. Rats exposed to ozone for 3 days were killed 2 h or 1, 2, or 4 days after the exposure. Control rats were killed after a 7-day exposure to filtered air. One nasal passage from the anterior nasal cavity of each rat was fixed and processed for light microscopy to morphometrically determine the numeric densities of epithelial cells, neutrophils, and mucous cells, and the amount of intraepithelial mucosubstances in the NTE. The maxilloturbinate from the other nasal passage was processed for analysis of an airway mucin-specific gene (i.e., rMuc-5AC mRNA). Acute ozone exposure induced a rapid increase in rMuc-5AC mRNA levels prior to the onset of MCM, and the increased levels of rMuc-5AC mRNA persisted with MCM. Neutrophilic inflammation coincided with epithelial DNA synthesis and upregulation of rMuc-5AC, but was resolved when MCM first appeared in the NTE. The results of the present study suggest that upregulation of mucin mRNA by acute ozone exposure may be associated with the concurrent neutrophilic inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia in the NTE. Ozone-induced MCM may be dependent on these important pre-metaplastic responses (i.e., mucin mRNA upregulation, neutrophilic inflammation, and epithelial proliferation)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hotchkiss", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harkema", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "5R01 HL51712-13", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mucin-5B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mucins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G34N38R2N1", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromodeoxyuridine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bromodeoxyuridine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Goblet Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Metaplasia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mucin-5B"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mucins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Turbinates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10496685", "10.1093/toxsci/51.1.135"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
