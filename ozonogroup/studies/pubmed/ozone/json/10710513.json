These (poly)cations exert interactions with anions, e.g., DNA and RNA. This feature represents their best-known direct physiological role in cellular functions: cell growth, division, and differentiation. The lung and, more specifically, alveolar epithelial cells appear to be endowed with a much higher polyamine uptake system than any other major organ. In the lung, the active accumulation of natural polyamines in the epithelium has been studied in various mammalian species including rat, hamster, rabbit, and human. The kinetic parameters (Michaelis-Menten constant and maximal uptake) of the uptake system are the same order of magnitude regardless of the polyamine or species studied and the in vitro system used. Also, other pulmonary cells accumulate polyamines but never to the same extent as the epithelium. Although different uptake systems exist for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in the lung, neither the nature of the carrier protein nor the reason for its existence is known. Some pulmonary toxicological and/or pathological conditions have been related to polyamine metabolism and/or polyamine content in the lung. Polyamines possess an important intrinsic toxicity. From in vitro studies with nonpulmonary cells, it has been shown that spermidine and spermine can be metabolized to hydrogen peroxide, ammonium, and acrolein, which can all cause cellular toxicity. In hyperoxia or after ozone exposure, the increased polyamine synthesis and polyamine content of the rat lung is correlated with survival of the animals. Pulmonary hypertension induced by monocrotaline or hypoxia has also been linked to the increased polyamine metabolism and polyamine content of the lung. In a small number of studies, it has been shown that polyamines can contribute to the suppression of immunologic reactions in the lung."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Lung Toxicology, Laboratory of Pneumology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoet", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nemery", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100901229", "ISSNLinking": "1040-0605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Polyamines"}], "NumberOfReferences": "173"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10710513", "10.1152/ajplung.2000.278.3.L417"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
