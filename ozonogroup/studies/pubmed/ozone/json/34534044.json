EG prepared at 500\u00b0C was found to be highly effective for the mineralization of oxalic acid aqueous solution during ozonation at pH 3, which was ascribed to the formation of hydroxyl radicals from the surface reaction of surface hydroxyl groups on EG with ozone. The performance of expanded graphite in this catalytic system was basically unchanged after three repeated use.

Degradations of oxamic acid and pyruvic acid in catalytic ozonation with EG were pH-dependent, which were lower than that of oxalic acid. The degradations of oxalic acid and oxamic acid were identified as mineralization process by the determination of TOC, while pyruvic acid may transform into organic products such as acetic acid by O<sub>3</sub>/EG. Manganese ion (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) could promote the degradation of oxalic acid by O<sub>3</sub>/EG at pH 3 because permanganate was produced by O<sub>3</sub>/EG in oxalic acid solution and then reacted with oxalic acid readily at acidic pH. Catalytic ozonation by EG exhibited great application potential for the destruction of refractory organic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Sha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7782-42-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Graphite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QU60N5OPLG", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8558G7RUTR", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E7R5L6H31", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Graphite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34534044", "10.1080/09593330.2021.1983024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
