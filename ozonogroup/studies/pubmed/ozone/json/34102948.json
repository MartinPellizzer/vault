Studies compared treatment options to avoid the initial caries lesion progression with at least 12\u2009months of follow-up were included. Network meta-analyses were conducted considering the non-progression of caries lesions as an outcome.", "Potentially eligible studies were screened (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20092820) and eleven were included. Six studies evaluated the use of fluoride varnish, resin infiltration, sealing, and toothbrushing/flossing on proximal initial caries lesions. When considering occlusal surfaces, only two studies evaluating the ozone gas, fluoride varnish, resin infiltration, and sealants were included. For buccal/lingual surfaces, three studies evaluating toothbrushing, CPP-ACP paste, fluoride varnish, and resin infiltration were included. For all types of surfaces, the resin infiltration showed the best probability to avoid the progression of initial caries lesions.", "The limited number of included studies, most with a high risk of bias and lack of hard outcomes, such as frank cavitation, makes it not feasible to recommend a specific management approach for initial caries lesion control in primary teeth with a high certainty of evidence.
