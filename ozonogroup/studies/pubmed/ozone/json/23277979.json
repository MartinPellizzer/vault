The innovative cathode (K) of this axial symmetric diode which operated at the high voltage (\u03c6(0)), has a large number of sharpened nozzles located on different radial planes of its central tubular-mast and is encircled by the anode (A). The nozzles played the dual role of oxygen (O(2)) injection as well as creation of high electric field (E) in the A-K gap, enabled the formation of a cold corona. Electrons in the corona under the influence of E moved towards anode, collided with O(2) and created the O radicals. O in turn joined the free O(2) and formed O(3). The evolution of O(3) here is modeled in various O(2) pressure (P), electron density (n(e)), and temperature (T) in terms of the major reaction modes involving e, O, O(2), and O(3). Typical steady state O(3) density attained so in P ~ bar, n(e) ~ 10(15) m(-3) and T ~ 300 K is over 10(25) m(-3) and that of O lower ~10(20) m(-3). Both the O and O(3) densities increased with an enhanced n(e) of avalanche multiplications in corona. O(3) increased also with a higher P but the temporal O reversed in trend midway and reduced with P towards the steady state. A sharp decline in diode resistance with smaller A-K gap induced finite discharge current and led to the undesired heating of corona. It is shown that the O(3) density reduced with the temperature rise but O density reduced with the T rise up to 500 K and then rose modestly with the further T increase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pillai's Institute of Information Technology, Engineering, Media Studies and Research (PIIT), Dr. K.
