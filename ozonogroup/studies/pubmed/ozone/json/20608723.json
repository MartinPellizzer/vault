A total of 7694 samples and 35 NMHC species were analyzed. Positive matrix factorization (PMF), applied to identify and apportion the sources of NMHCs, resolved six sources: two fuel evaporative sources (36.3%), solvent sources (25.4%), mixed sources of vehicle exhaust and combustion (22.8%), petrochemical sources (9.6%), and biogenic sources (5.4%). During the summer, the largest contributors to ozone formation were biogenic sources (48.9% and 79.7% by maximum incremental reactivity and propene-equivalent concentration, respectively), which were situated locally, and secondary sources included solvent sources (22.2% and 7.4%) and fuel evaporative sources (15.6% and 8.2%). For evaporative-1 sources composed of long-lived alkanes, the potential source contribution function (PSCF) technique using 48 h back trajectories revealed oil and gas fields in China as potential source areas of fresh \"regional\" air masses. In addition, the PSCF results for evaporative-2 sources and a long-lived marker species of vehicle exhaust/combustion sources showed that the NMHC mixing ratio in Sukmo, South Korea was enhanced by long-range transport from the Shandong area in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-742, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Eunhwa", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Jong-Bae", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Seung-Muk", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Democratic People's Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20608723", "10.1021/es903634e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
