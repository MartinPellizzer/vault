Under optimal conditions, the total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate of real hospital wastewater could reach 93.9%. Importantly, 126 pharmaceutical compounds (antibiotics, antivirals, analgesics, antiepileptics, hormones, and others) were determined in hospital wastewater by using ultra performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). 110 pharmaceutical compounds could be efficiently degraded in E-peroxone system. Concurrently, the microbial community analysis through high-throughput sequencing showed that E-peroxone process exhibited an excellent disinfection effect in real hospital wastewater. Escherichia coli as a bacterial indicator could be completely inactivated in E-peroxone process\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and hydroxyl radical (OH) were found in E-peroxone system based on the results of chemical probe experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. The in-situ generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from cathodic oxygen reduction in ODE can react with ozone to produce OH, and realize high efficiencies for the elimination of pharmaceutical and sterilization. This work established a green and effective way without extra addition of chemical reagents for high-efficiency treatment of real hospital wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
