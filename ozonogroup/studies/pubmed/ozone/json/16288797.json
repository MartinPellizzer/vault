Ozone and UV irradiation were used for oxidative decomposition of EDTA-metal complexes in extractants from Pb (1243 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (1190 mg kg(-1)) contaminated soil. Released metals were absorbed in a commercial metal absorbent Slovakite. Six-consecutive additions of 2.5 mmol kg(-1) EDTA (total 15 mmol kg(-1) EDTA) removed 49.6 +/- 0.6% and 19.7 +/- 1.7% of initial total Pb and Zn from soil (4.6 kg) packed in 22 cm high columns. The efficiency of extraction was similar to small-scale simulations of heap leaching (15 0 g of soil), where EDTA used in the same manner removed 49.7 +/- 1.0% and 13.7 +/- 0.4% of Pb and Zn. The new heap leaching method produced discharge extractant with fairly low final concentrations of Pb, Zn and EDTA (1.98 +/- 2.17 mg l(-1), 4.55 +/- 2.36 mg l(-1), and 0.05 +/- 0.04 mM, respectively), which could presumably be reduced even further with continuation of treatment. The results of our study indicate that for soils contaminated primarily with Pb, treating the EDTA extractants with ozone/UV and reuse of extractants enables efficient soil heap leaching with very little or no wastewater generation, easy control over emissions, and lowers the requirements for process water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agronomy Department, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finzgar", "ForeName": "Neza", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lestan", "ForeName": "Domen", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G34HU7RV0", "NameOfSubstance": "Edetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metallurgy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Slovenia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16288797", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.09.015", "S0045-6535(05)01090-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
