We investigated this question using a large, nationally representative cohort based on primary care records linked to hospital admissions.", "A cohort of 812\u2005063 patients aged 40-89\u2005years registered with 205 English general practices in 2002 without a COPD diagnosis was followed from 2003 to 2007. First COPD diagnoses recorded either by a general practitioner (GP) or on admission to hospital were identified. Annual average concentrations in 2002 for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <10\u2005\u00b5m (PM10) and <2.5\u2005\u00b5m (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone and sulfur dioxide (SO2) at 1\u2005km(2) resolution were estimated from emission-based dispersion models. Hazard ratios (HRs) per interquartile range change were estimated from Cox models adjusting for age, sex, smoking, body mass index and area-level deprivation.", "16\u2005034 participants (1.92%) received a COPD diagnosis from their GP and 2910 participants (0.35%) were admitted to hospital for COPD. After adjustment, HRs for GP recorded COPD and PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 were close to unity, positive for SO2 (HR=1.07 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.11) per 2.2\u2005\u00b5g/m(3)) and negative for ozone (HR=0.94 (0.89 to 1.00) per 3\u2005\u00b5g/m(3)). For admissions HRs for PM2.5 and NO2 remained positive (HRs=1.05 (0.98 to 1.13) and 1.06 (0.98 to 1.15) per 1.9\u2005\u00b5g/m(3) and 10.7\u2005\u00b5g/m(3), respectively).", "This large population-based cohort study found limited, inconclusive evidence for associations between air pollution and COPD incidence.
