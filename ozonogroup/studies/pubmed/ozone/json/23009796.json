MWCNTs presented a higher catalytic performance than activated carbons, which was justified by their differences in surface chemistry and by the higher internal mass transfer resistances expected for activated carbons. 3-Amino-5-methylisoxazole and p-benzoquinone were detected as primary products of single and catalytic ozonation of SMX, whereas oxamic, oxalic, pyruvic and maleic acids were identified as refractory final oxidation products. The original sulphur of the SMX was almost completely converted to sulphate and part of the nitrogen was converted to NH4+ and NO3-. The presence of the radical scavenger tert-butanol during catalytic and single ozonation evidenced the participation of HO radicals in the oxidation mechanisms of SMX, especially in the mineralization of several intermediates. Microtox tests revealed that simultaneous use of ozone and MWCNTs originated lower acute toxicity. The time course of all detected compounds was studied and the transformation pathway for the complete mineralization of SMX by single and catalytic ozonation in the presence of the selected materials was elucidated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.
