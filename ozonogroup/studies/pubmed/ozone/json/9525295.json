To further clarify the role of neurogenic inflammation in ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, we investigated the effects of a specific tachykinin receptor antagonist (FK-224) in guinea pigs. Animals were anaesthetized, tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated. Total pulmonary resistance (RL) was calculated from transpulmonary pressure and box flow in a plethysmograph. Airway responsiveness was assessed by determining the provocative concentration of histamine aerosol that increased RL to twice the baseline value (PC200). Animals were injected with either FK-224 (10 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.2 mL/kg DMSO) or vehicle (0.2 mL/kg DMSO) intravenously, then pre-ozone PC200 was determined. Following this measurement, animals were exposed to 3 ppm ozone for 60 min. Immediately after exposure, the histamine dose response curve was evaluated again. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in animals treated with FK-224 or vehicle. In animals treated with vehicle, ozone exposure caused significant decrease in PC200 and moderate increase in neutrophils in BAL fluid. FK-224 pre-treatment significantly inhibited ozone-induced hyperresponsiveness. Neutrophils in BAL fluid did not significantly increase after ozone exposure in animals treated with FK-224. By contrast, the degree of epithelial desquamation did not differ significantly between the two groups. We conclude that neurogenic inflammation caused by tachykinin release may be responsible for ozone-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and that tachykinins may play a role in the initiation of airway inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Diseases of the Chest, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aizawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakano", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takata", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shigyo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Respirology", "NlmUniqueID": "9616368", "ISSNLinking": "1323-7799"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Tachykinin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "125787-94-2", "NameOfSubstance": "FK 224"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infusions, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Tachykinin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9525295", "10.1111/j.1440-1843.1997.tb00087.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
