These times are associated with maximal proliferation of the alveolar type II epithelium and their subsequent transformation to new type I cells. Immediately following ozone exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrated neutrophil accumulation that was no longer present 4 d later. The number of lavaged macrophages was also found to be increased immediately following ozone exposure, and remained elevated at 4 d postexposure. Whole-lung determinations of key enzymes involved in energy generation (succinate oxidase) and maintenance of lung NADPH and reduced glutathione were corrected for changes in cell number, by use of lung DNA measurements. Immediately following ozone exposure succinate oxidase (SOX), glucose-6-phosphate (G6PD), and 6-phosphogluconate (6PGD) dehydrogenase activities per milligram DNA were significantly enhanced by 76%, 48%, and 21%, respectively. These data suggested that ozone-exposed lungs had cells with increased mitochondria and NADPH-generating capability consistent with the increased metabolic needs of a proliferating epithelium. At 4 d postexposure, only G6PD activity per milligram DNA remained higher by 22% than air-exposed controls. Although both glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) and peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities per lung were elevated in lungs immediately following exposure and 4 d later, when corrected for DNA only GSH-Px activity was significantly increased by 29% in lungs after the postexposure period. Lungs 4 d postexposure therefore had cells relatively enriched in G6PD and GSH-Px that might account for the increased ozone tolerance that has previously been associated with the formation of new type I epithelium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassett", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bowen-Kelly", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elbon", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reichenbaugh", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03505", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-34674", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "cytology", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3184201", "10.1080/15287398809531213"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
