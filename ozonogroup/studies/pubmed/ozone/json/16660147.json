Pinto. Leaf chlorophyll is extracted with ethanol and analyzed spectrophotometrically; the concentration is expressed on the basis of leaf dry weight.The per cent chlorophyll reduction of ozone-injured leaves was highly correlated with the per cent visible necrosis and chlorosis (r = 0.96). The variability in injury estimates with chlorophyll analysis was slightly less than with visual evaluation. An evaluation of chlorophyll a and b concentrations separately showed that the chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased with increasing amounts of injury. Chlorophyll determinations made for leaves harvested at intervals after an ozone treatment indicated that maximum chlorophyll reduction had occurred by 4 days.This procedure for measuring ozone injury should be useful in eliminating the human bias associated with visible estimates of injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knudson", "ForeName": "L L", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tibbitts", "ForeName": "T W", "Initials": "TW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1949 Jan;24(1):1-15", "ArticleIdList": ["16654194"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1965 Nov 29;109(2):448-53", "ArticleIdList": ["5867546"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16660147", "PMC542673", "10.1104/pp.60.4.606"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
