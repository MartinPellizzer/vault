AIRNow data assimilation was applied to the boundary layer, and MODIS AOD data were used to adjust total column aerosol. Four OI cases were designed to examine the effects of uncertainty setting and assimilation time; two of these cases used uncertainties that varied in time and location, or \"dynamic uncertainties.\" More frequent assimilation and higher model uncertainties pushed the modeled results closer to the observation. Our comparison over a 24-hr period showed that ozone and PM2.5 mean biases could be reduced from 2.54 ppbV to 1.06 ppbV and from -7.14 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 to -0.11 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, respectively, over CONUS, while their correlations were also improved. Comparison to DISCOVER-AQ 2011 aircraft measurement showed that surface ozone assimilation applied to the CMAQ simulation improves regional low-altitude (below 2 km) ozone simulation.", "This paper described an application of using optimal interpolation method to improve the model's ozone and PM2.5 estimation using surface measurement and satellite AOD. It highlights the usage of the operational AIRNow data set, which is available in near real time, and the MODIS AOD. With a similar method, we can also use other satellite products, such as the latest VIIRS products, to improve PM2.5 prediction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, College Park , MD , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites , University of Maryland, College Park , MD , USA."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Youhua", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, College Park , MD , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites , University of Maryland, College Park , MD , USA."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Tianfeng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, College Park , MD , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites , University of Maryland, College Park , MD , USA."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, College Park , MD , USA."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Pius", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, College Park , MD , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites , University of Maryland, College Park , MD , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems , George Mason University , Fairfax , VA , USA."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, College Park , MD , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites , University of Maryland, College Park , MD , USA."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun-Cheol", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, College Park , MD , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Changchun , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Remote Sensing Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uncertainty"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26091206", "10.1080/10962247.2015.1062439"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
