Significant variations in the frequency of visits as well as environmental conditions could be seen on a daily basis. Despite comparisons of results on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, no significant relationships could be found between any of the pollution indices and emergency room visits. Staggering visits by 1 and 7 days, however, revealed a relationship between emergency room visits and air pollution index and air quality index. An association between emergency room visits and NO2 and ozone was seen when visits were staggered by 7 but not by 1 day.", "We conclude the fluctuations in overall air quality are associated with increased frequency of emergency room visits but only when data are lagged by a predefined period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Asthmas Center, Toronto Hospital, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kesten", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szalai", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dzyngel", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3GSN3JCJ5K", "NameOfSubstance": "sodium peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emergencies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7889385"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
