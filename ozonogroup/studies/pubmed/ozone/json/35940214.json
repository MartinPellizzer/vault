We linked daily PAP-derived data to air pollution databases using postal codes. The primary exposures were mean nocturnal (8 pm to 8 am) residential concentrations of ozone, fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI). Potential confounders considered were demographics, season and year of exposure, initial OSA severity, other PAP parameters, and climate-related variables.", "Eight thousand one hundred forty-eight adults were analyzed with a median of 89\u00a0days (interquartile range [IQR], 29-302\u00a0days) of observation during which PAP was used for\u00a0\u2265 4 h. The median daily AHI<sub>Flow</sub> was 1.2/h (IQR, 0.5-2.5/h). In mixed multivariate regression analyses, an increase in air pollution was associated with a statistically significant increase in AHI<sub>Flow</sub> for most statistical models. The largest effect was for the AQHI: an increase in AHI<sub>Flow</sub> while comparing highest vs\u00a0lowest quartiles was 0.07/h (95%\u00a0CI, 0.05-0.10/h).", "We demonstrated a modest but statistically significant increase in residual respiratory events during PAP therapy associated with an increase in air pollution concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2022.
