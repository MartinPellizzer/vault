I. Reactive Red 120 by ozonation was investigated. The sample can be pretreated with a Dionex OnGuard P column, which has high selectivity for removing phenols, azo group-contaning compounds, aromatic carboxylic aicds etc. For the separation of organic and inorganic anions in the products, the anion exchange chromatograhy with gradient elution of NaOH was used. All the species were detected by both suppressed conductivity and UV absorbance detectors. The sulfate, oxalate, chloride, nitrate and formate could be identified even in very low concentration with ion chromatography, within 18 min, with the recoveries between 91.6% - 108.3%. The results indicate that the method is reliable, simple, rapid and especially sensitive. In combining with the determination results of conventional parameters of the solution of Reactive Red 120, a preliminary elucidation of the degradation mechanism"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fei-Fang", "Initials": "FF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xin-Miao", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ji-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yediler", "ForeName": "Ayfer", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kettrup", "ForeName": "Antonius", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Se Pu", "NlmUniqueID": "9424804", "ISSNLinking": "1000-8713"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61951-82-4", "NameOfSubstance": "reactive red 120 dye"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triazines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16358701"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
