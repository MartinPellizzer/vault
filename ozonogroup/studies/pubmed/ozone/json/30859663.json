Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that Mn and Ce oxides were successfully loaded on the \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> support, and MnO<sub>2</sub> , Mn<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> , CeO<sub>2</sub> , and Ce<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> were the main components of the catalyst. Actual textile wastewater from biochemical effluent was used as experiment wastewater. The removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and chromaticity were approximately 30.6% (414-287\u00a0mg/L on average) and 99.3% (4,033 times to 27 times on average), respectively during the 30-day on-site continuous-flow test with an ozone dosage, contact time, and gas-liquid ratio of 100\u00a0mg/L, 15.7\u00a0min, and 2.9, respectively. Following 1\u00a0g/L AC adsorption, the effluent COD concentration was reduced to 40\u00a0mg/L. By contrast, AC adsorption without catalytic ozonation as pretreatment required 10\u00a0g/L AC dosage to achieve similar treatment results. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses indicated that volatile phenols, sulfides, and aniline in wastewater were completely removed after treatment. Inductively coupled plasma results further showed that the active components of MnO<sub>x</sub> -CeO<sub>x</sub> in the catalyst were stable after continuous use for 60\u00a0days. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Mesoporous catalyst synthesized by impregnating MnO<sub>x</sub> -CeO<sub>x</sub> on \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> support. Catalytic ozonation and AC adsorption were combined to degrade organics. Maximum degradation of COD and chromaticity by optimizing process variables. The efficiency of the method was compared to that of single AC adsorption."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Water Environment Federation."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shengkai", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Huaqi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Guangqing", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1904-0622"], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Bensheng", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "Z171100001417003", "Agency": "Science and Technology Plan Projects, Beijing, China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30859663", "10.1002/wer.1102"]}}]}
