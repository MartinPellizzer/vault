Because ozone itself does not penetrate the cells but immediately reacts with polyunsaturated fatty acids, its effects are the results of oxidative mediators. Among the molecule produces by the interaction of ozone with biological systems, there are HNE and H2O2. At today, the cellular mechanisms accounting for the positive effects of mild ozonization on wound closure are still largely unexplored. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different non-toxic doses of ozonated saline ranging from 2 to 300\u2009\u03bcM, in an in vitro wound scratch model by the use of human keratinocytes. The results showed that ozonated saline is able to improve in vitro wound healing by stimulating cell proliferation as measured by BrdU assay and PCNA protein levels. In order to better elucidate the molecules that play the main role in the beneficial effect of ozonated saline in wound healing, HNE and H2O2 were used alone or in combination to mimic ozonated saline effect. Surprisingly, keratinocytes treated with different doses of HNE and H2O2 did not significantly improve the wound closure, while the combination of the two compounds was able to improve wound closure. In addition, Nrf2 pathways were also activated as determined by its translocation to the nucleus and the increased HO1 gene expression. The present work suggests that ozonated saline effect on wound closure is the results of the combination of more molecules among which HNE and H2O2 play a key role."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy ;"}], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy ;"}], "LastName": "Sticozzi", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy , University of Siena , Siena , Italy."}], "LastName": "Zanardi", "ForeName": "Iacopo", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy ;"}], "LastName": "Belmonte", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy ;"}], "LastName": "Cervellati", "ForeName": "Franco", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy , University of Siena , Siena , Italy."}], "LastName": "Bocci", "ForeName": "Velio", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy , University of Siena , Siena , Italy."}], "LastName": "Travagli", "ForeName": "Valter", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27487012", "10.1080/10715762.2016.1219731"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
