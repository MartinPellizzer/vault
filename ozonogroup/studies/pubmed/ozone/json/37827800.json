As an important producer of VHCs, the release of VHCs by marine microalgae is affected by marine environmental factors. Microplastics are an important pollutant in the ocean; however, there are few studies on VHCs release from marine microalgae under the influence of microplastics. This study aimed to explore the effects of different concentrations of polyethylene (PE) microplastics on the growth, photosynthesis, oxidative stress, and release of VHCs by diatoms and dinoflagellates by measuring the density of algae, maximum photoquantum efficiency (<i>F</i><sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i><sub>m</sub>), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and concentration of VHCs. The results revealed that PE microplastics mainly inhibited the growth of <i>Nitzschia closterium</i> f. minutissima and promoted the growth of <i>Prorocentrum donghaiense</i>. The addition of 50 \u03bcm PE microplastics had a shielding effect on the growth of the two microalgae, resulting in the inhibition of <i>F</i><sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i><sub>m</sub> of two kinds of microalgae, and the inhibition effect of PE microplastics on <i>P. donghaiense</i> was more significant. Compared with that in the control group, PE microplastic stress stimulated the increase in ROS production in algal cells, which caused an oxidative stress response in these microalgae, thereby promoting the release of three types of volatile brominated halocarbons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Chemistry Theory and Technology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266100, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Chemistry Theory and Technology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266100, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, Ministry of Natural Resources, Qingdao 266061, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Xing", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Chemistry Theory and Technology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266100, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Gui-Peng", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Chemistry Theory and Technology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266100, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microplastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microalgae"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Microplastics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dinoflagellida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diatoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "18"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37827800", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202208056"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
