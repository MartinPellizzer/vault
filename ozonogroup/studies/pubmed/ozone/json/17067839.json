Reactive Black 5 (RB5) in solution by a combination of sonolysis and ozonation was investigated. The results showed that the optimum pH for the reaction was 11.0, and both lower and higher pH decreased the decolorization rate. Increasing the initial concentration of RB5 led to a decreasing decolorization rate. Under the experimental conditions, the decolorization rate increased with an increase in temperature. The decolorization of RB5 followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Based on the decolorization rate constants obtained at different temperatures within the range 287-338K and the Arrhenius equation, the apparent activation energy (E(a)) was calculated to be 11.2kJmol(-1). This indicated that the reaction has little dependence on temperature. The color decay was considerably faster than the decrease in total organic carbon (TOC), which was attributed to the ease of chromophore destruction. Hence the efficiency of decolorization was 84% compared with 4% of TOC removal after 5min reaction. Additionally, muconic acid, (2Z)-pent-2-enedioic acid and maleic acid were identified as main oxidation products by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after 150min of reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhiqiao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Huamin", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Haiping", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianmeng", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ultrason Sonochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9433356", "ISSNLinking": "1350-4177"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17067839", "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2006.09.002", "S1350-4177(06)00111-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
