The quantum efficiency of PSII was unchanged by O<sub>3</sub> exposure. \u2022\u2002 Stomatal aperture declined in parallel with CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in O<sub>3</sub> -treated plants, but this did not account for the observed decline in photosynthesis. Findings suggested that O<sub>3</sub> -induced shifts in stomatal conductance result from 'direct' effects on the stomatal complex as well as 'indirect effects' mediated through changes in intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Leaves on the same plant exposed to equivalent levels of O<sub>3</sub> showed striking differences in their response to the pollutant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Laboratory, Department of Agricultural and Environmental Science, Ridley Building, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Global Environmental Research, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Onogawa 16-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0053, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimizu", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Laboratory, Department of Agricultural and Environmental Science, Ridley Building, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Allen DJ, McKee IF, Farage PK, Baker NR. 1997.
