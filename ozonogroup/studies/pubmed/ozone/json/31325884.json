In this study, using a three-dimensional numerical model [nested air quality prediction modeling system (NAQPMS)] coupled with an on-line source apportionment module, the contribution of different source regions and source categories to the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the PRD region was quantified. A comparison with observation data confirmed that the NAQPMS adequately reproduced surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in different seasons. Compared with biogenic emissions, anthropogenic precursors play a dominant role in O<sub>3</sub> production. In Guangzhou city, among different source categories, mobile emission is the largest contributor (accounting for approximately 40%), followed by industry emissions (20%-24%). Regional control measures for solvent use and mobile emissions are effective for reducing O<sub>3</sub> concentration. In the PRD region, self-contribution is more significant in daytime (\u223c40%) than in nighttime (\u223c10%) on average. Among the source regions outside PRD, the northern part of Guangdong province, Jiangxi province, and Fujian province are important contributors. Within the PRD region, the self-contribution of each city increases by 12%-32% during O<sub>3</sub> episodes (>80\u202fppbv) compared with the annual mean contribution. The contribution of the entire PRD region and the entire Guangdong province is 46%-63% and 63%-74% in PRD cities during O<sub>3</sub> episodes. These results indicate that regional collaboration on emission control within PRD or Guangdong province is effective for reducing O<sub>3</sub> episodes in the PRD region. In addition, because long-range transport from regions outside Guangdong province played an important role in the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the PRD region, long-term emission control measures throughout China in subsequent years should be propitious to further reduce the annual O<sub>3</sub> level and improve air quality in the PRD region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
