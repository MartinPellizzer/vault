In this study, in-situ soft X-rays were coupled to a DC (direct current) corona-based electrostatic precipitator (ESP). The soft X-rays significantly enhanced Hg0 oxidation, due to generation of electrons from photoionization of gas molecules and the ESP electrodes. This coupling technique worked better in the positive corona discharge mode because more electrons were in the high energy region near the electrode. Detailed mechanisms of Hg0 oxidation are proposed and discussed based on ozone generation measurements and Hg0 oxidation behavior observations in single gas environments (O2, N2, and CO2). The effect of O2 concentration in flue gas, as well as the effects of particles (SiO2, TiO2, and KI) was also evaluated. In addition, the performance of a soft X-rays coupled ESP in Hg0 oxidations was investigated in a lab-scale coal combustion system. With the ESP voltage at +10 kV, soft X-ray enhancement, and KI addition, mercury oxidation was maximized.", "Mercury is a significant-impact atmospheric pollutant due to its toxicity. Coal-fired power plants are the primary emission sources of anthropogenic releases of mercury; hence, mercury emission control from coal-fired power plant is important. This study provides an alternative mercury control technology for coal-fired power plants. The proposed electrostatic precipitator with in situ soft X-rays has high efficiency on elemental mercury conversion. Effects of flue gas conditions (gas compositions, particles, etc.) on performance of this technology were also evaluated, which provided guidance on the application of the technology for coal-fired power plant mercury control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Aerosol and Air Quality Research Laboratory, Department of Energy , Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis , St. Louis , MO , USA."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "He", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaofei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ning", "Initials": "WN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "Pratim", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal Ash"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coal Ash"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Static Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25947215", "10.1080/10962247.2014.998352"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
