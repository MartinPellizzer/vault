This effect is attributable to the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and other NO-related species, which may be improved by ascorbate or other antioxidants. However, the BP responses to oral nitrite result, at least in part, of increased gastric S-nitrosothiol formation. This study tested the hypothesis that ascorbate may destroy S-nitrosothiols and therefore not all doses of ascorbate enhance the BP responses to oral nitrite. We assessed the BP responses to oral sodim nitrite (0.2\u202fmmol/kg) in L-NAME hypertensive rats pretreated with ascorbate (0, 0.02, 0.2, or 2\u202fmmol/kg). Plasma and gastric wall concentrations of nitrite and nitroso compounds concentrations were determined using an ozone-based reductive chemiluminescence assay. Nitrate concentrations were determined using the Griess reaction. Free thiol concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay. The BP responses to nitrite exhibited a bell-shape profile as they were not modified by ascorbate 0.02\u202fmmol/l, whereas the 0.2\u202fmmol/kg dose enhanced and the 2\u202fmmol/kg dose attenuated BP responses. In parallel with BP responses, nitrite-induced increases in plasma nitrite and RSNO species were not modified by ascorbate 0.02\u202fmmol/l, whereas the 0.2\u202fmmol/kg dose enhanced and the 2\u202fmmol/kg dose attenuated them. Similar experiments were carried out with an equimolar dose of S-nitrosogluthathione. Ascorbate dose-dependently impaired the BP responses to S-nitrosogluthathione, and the corresponding increases in plasma RSNO, but not in plasma nitrite concentrations. This is the first study to show that while ascorbate dose-dependently impairs the BP responses to oral S-nitrosogluthathione, there are contrasting effects when low versus high ascorbate doses are compared with respect to its effects on the blood pressure responses to oral nitrite administration. Our findings may have special implications to patients taking ascorbate, as high doses of this vitamin may impair protective mechanisms associated with nitrite or nitrate from dietary sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
