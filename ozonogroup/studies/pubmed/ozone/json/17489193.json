The results indicated that degradation rate of the two processes both increased firstly and decreased subsequently with the increase of the concentration of HCO3- (0 - 200 mg x L(-1)), and reached the climax at the concentration of bicarbonate ion 50 mg x L(-1) under the same experimental condition. The degradation rates of ozonation alone and ozonation/ ceramic honeycomb both declined by 16.57% and 27.52% with the increase of the concentration of CO3(2-) (0 - 20 mg x L(-1)), respectively, and decreased by 13.61% and 17.52% with the addition of the concentration of HPO4(2-) (0 - 12 mg x L(-1)), and reduced by 6.61% and 12.52% with the enhancement of the concentration of H2PO4- (0 - 120 mg x L(-1)), and dropped by 30.06% and 46.09% with the increasing of the concentration of tert-butanol (0 - 10 mg x L(-1)). The experimental results indicated that decomposition of nitrobenzene in both processes all followed the mechanism of oxidization by OH free radical, and tert-butanol is a more suitable indicator for the radical type reaction. The removal rate of ozonation alone rose with the increase of the concentration of pH (3.02 - 10.96), but that of ozonation/ceramic honeycomb process reached the maximum at pH = 9.23."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zheng-Qian", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yi-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17489193"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
