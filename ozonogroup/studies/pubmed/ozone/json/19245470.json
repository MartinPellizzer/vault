The method offers a true 'totals'determination in that a solution of the whole sample is analysed. Samples are dissolved/suspended in water or aqueous THF, and nitrite/nitrite ester interferences are removed by prior treatment with sulphamic acid. The treated test solution is denitrosated in a single reaction with HBr/acetic acid, in refluxing n-propyl acetate, and 'total'N-nitroso compounds are determined in a chemiluminescence reaction of the released nitric oxide with ozone. The use of a propyl acetate denitrosation solvent and of higher concentrations of HBr have improved both the sensitivity (routine limit of determination at 10 mugkg(-1)) and water tolerance of the method. The method was shown to recover N-nitrosamines quantitatively, and to be sufficiently repeatable and reproducible to be used as a screening technique for N-nitroso compounds in personal care products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK76AA, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Challis", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colling", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cromie", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guthrie", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pollock", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Telling", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wallace", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Cosmet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8007161", "ISSNLinking": "0142-5463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19245470", "10.1111/j.1467-2494.1995.tb00127.x", "ICS219"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
