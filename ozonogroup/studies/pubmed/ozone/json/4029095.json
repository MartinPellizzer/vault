Blocks of tissue selected throughout the lung and from first generation RBs following airway microdissection had the following significant exposure-related changes: 57% greater volume of RB in the lung, 27% smaller diameter of RB lumen, 179% thicker media and intima of peribronchiolar arterioles, 61% thicker RB epithelium, and 77% thicker PCT. The increase in thickness of the RB wall resulted primarily from an 84% increase in PCT, with the remainder from the epithelium. Estimates of cellular numerical density showed an 81% increase in cuboidal bronchiolar cells and an 87% decrease in type 1 pneumocytes in the exposed group. Cell volumes from serial section reconstruction showed significantly larger cuboidal bronchiolar (79%), ciliated (117%), and type 2 (66%) cells over controls. Significant PCT changes included more amorphous extracellular matrix (288%), neutrophils (1523%), and lymphocytes/plasma cells (307%). The number of fibroblasts and the volume of extracellular fibers were larger than control values by 44% and 31% in the exposed group, but these changes were not statistically significant. Centriacinar changes due to exposure to long-term, high ambient ozone in bonnet monkeys results in narrowing of respiratory bronchioles primarily by peribronchiolar inflammation (inflammatory cells, fibers, amorphous matrix) and secondarily through hyperplasia of cuboidal bronchiolar cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujinaka", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyde", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyler", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dungworth", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lollini", "ForeName": "L O", "Initials": "LO"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P01 ES 00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca radiata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4029095", "10.3109/01902148509057520"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
