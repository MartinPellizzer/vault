Accordingly we exercised seven trained athletes for 1 h at 75% of maximal O2 consumption in both room air and a 0.21 ppm O3 environment. Pulmonary function tests, including forced expiratory maneuvers and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), were performed prior to and immediately following the 1-h test. Significant decreases in forced vital capacity (FVC, -7%), forced expired volume in 1.0 s (-15%), forced expiratory flow over the midhalf of FVC (-18%), and MVV (-17%) were recorded following O3 exposure. The magnitudes of these changes are similar to those observed in subjects performing moderate intermittent exercise for 2 h in a 0.24 ppm O3 environment. Symptoms reported following O3 exposure included laryngeal and/or tracheal irritation and soreness and chest tightness on taking a deep breath. The observed alterations in lung functions in these subjects indicate that individuals performing heavy continuous exercise are more likely to be affected by lower O3 levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bedi", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horvath", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-26034-2", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Volume Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6501039", "10.1152/jappl.1984.57.4.984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
