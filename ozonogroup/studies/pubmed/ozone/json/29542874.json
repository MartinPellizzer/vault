The objective of this study was to determine whether SoClean\u00ae has potential as a disinfection device for families with CF by killing CF associated bacteria without altering nebulizer output.", "Ozone based disinfection effectively kills bacterial pathogens inoculated to home nebulizer equipment without gross changes in nebulizer function.", "Common bacterial pathogens associated with CF were inoculated onto the PariLC\u00ae jet nebulizer and bacterial recovery compared with or without varied ozone exposure. In separate experiments, nebulizer output was estimated after repeated ozone exposure by weighing the nebulizer.", "Ozone disinfection was time dependent with a 5\u2009min infusion time and 120\u2009min dwell time effectively killing >99.99% bacteria tested including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
