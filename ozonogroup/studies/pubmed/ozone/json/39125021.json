The content of bioactive compounds in this fruit may vary depending on the cultivar and the harvest date. This study analysed the effect of applying 5 ppm gaseous ozone for 1, 3, and 5 min on the chemical properties of <i>L. kamtschatica</i> varieties and newly created clones of <i>L. emphyllocalyx</i> for three years of cultivation. The fruits harvested from <i>L. emphyllocalyx</i>, depending on the year of harvest, had significantly larger size and weight compared to <i>L. kamtschatica</i>. On average, the acidity of the <i>L. emphyllocalyx</i> clones was 6% higher than other tested varieties. The average content of ascorbic acid was highest in <i>L. emphyllocalyx</i> clone '21-17'-57.80 mg\u00b7100 g<sup>-1</sup>; the year of harvest will significantly affect the content of vitamin C, reaching the highest level in 2022-53.92 mg\u00b7100 g<sup>-1</sup>. The total content of polyphenols was significantly dependent on the year of cultivation; reaching, on average, 54.8% more in 2022 compared to the rest of the years. The total antioxidant value using the FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS methods varied depending on the variety; exposure to ozone significantly increased the antioxidant value in each case. On the basis of the study, both botanical varieties can be used in food processing. Gaseous ozone exposure can significantly influence chemical composition, increasing the health-promoting value of fruit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Agriculture Production Engineering, University of Rzesz\u00f3w, St. Zelwerowicza 4, 35-601 Rzeszow, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Doctoral School, University of Rzesz\u00f3w, St. Rejtana 16C, 35-959 Rzeszow, Poland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7672-5209"], "LastName": "Basara", "ForeName": "Oskar", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Agriculture Production Engineering, University of Rzesz\u00f3w, St. Zelwerowicza 4, 35-601 Rzeszow, Poland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1028-097X"], "LastName": "Gorzelany", "ForeName": "J\u00f3zef", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lonicera"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39125021", "10.3390/molecules29153616", "molecules29153616"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
