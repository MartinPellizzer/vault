For this purpose, the effect of operating parameters such as ozone and Fe-EDTA concentrations, current, initial pH, and reaction time were investigated. The findings revealed that the EC process and single ozonation process (SOP) could alone reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) in landfill leachate by 23% and 39%; respectively. Moreover, integration of both processes at 100\u00a0mA current, 400\u00a0mg\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> ozone concentration, and 3\u00a0h reaction time could significantly improve COD reduction to 70%. As well, current efficiency and ozone consumption in the proposed system could considerably develop compared with EC process and SOP. The integrated electro-catalytic SOP using Fe-EDTA could be operated at neutral pH value, which the COD removal efficiency was obtained 79.7%. Subsequently, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>)/COD ratio of effluent increased to 0.64. Examining pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics, it was realized that constant rate in the system had augmented. These results also indicated that the modified process using Fe-EDTA was a promising landfill leachate pretreatment technique that could significantly enhance COD removal efficiency and BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD ratio, and ultimately decrease time and sludge production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
