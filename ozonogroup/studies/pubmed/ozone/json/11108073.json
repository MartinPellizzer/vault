Major current environmental problems that can be expected to have a substantial effect on human health include human-induced climate change and stratosphere ozone depletion, because they threaten the ecological support systems on which human life depends. The most serious potential consequence of global environmental change is the erosion of Earth's life-support systems. The public health assessments of the present and future anthropogenic damage to the biosphere have important implications for human health and wellbeing. Medical practitioners have an important role to play in this field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Public Health Research, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust N Z J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "1264322", "ISSNLinking": "0004-8291"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11108073", "10.1111/j.1445-5994.2000.tb00864.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
