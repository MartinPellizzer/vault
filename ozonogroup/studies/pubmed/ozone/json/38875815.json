This study investigated the association between daily air pollution exposure and respiratory symptoms among participants with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), using a unique dataset passively collected by digital sensors monitoring inhaled medication use. The aggregated dataset comprised 456,779 short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) puffs across 3,386 people with asthma or COPD, between 2012 and 2019, across the state of California. Each rescue use was assigned space-time air pollution values of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter with diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5 \u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), derived from highly spatially resolved air pollution surfaces generated for the state of California. Statistical analyses were conducted using linear mixed models and random forest machine learning. Results indicate that daily air pollution exposure is positively associated with an increase in daily SABA use, for individual pollutants and simultaneous exposure to multiple pollutants. The advanced linear mixed model found that a 10-ppb increase in NO<sub>2</sub>, a 10 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and a 30-ppb increase in O<sub>3</sub> were respectively associated with incidence rate ratios of SABA use of 1.025 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.013-1.038), 1.054 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.041-1.068), and 1.161 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.127-1.233), equivalent to a respective 2.5\u00a0%, 5.4\u00a0% and 16\u00a0% increase in SABA puffs over the mean. The random forest machine learning approach showed similar results. This study highlights the potential of digital health sensors to provide valuable insights into the daily health impacts of environmental exposures, offering a novel approach to epidemiological research that goes beyond residential address. Further investigation is warranted to explore potential causal relationships and to inform public health strategies for respiratory disease management."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
