The removal efficiency (RE) and decomposition efficiency (DE) of PCDD/Fs achieved with V-Mn/Ti-CNTs alone were 95% and 45% at 150\u202f\u00b0C under a space velocity (SV) of 14000 h<sup>-1</sup>; yet, these values reached 99% and 91% when catalyst and low concentration (50\u202fppm) ozone were used in combined. The ozone promotion effect on catalytic activity was further enhanced with the addition of manganese oxide (MnO<sub>x</sub>) and CNTs. Adding MnO<sub>x</sub> and CNTs in V/Ti catalysts facilitated the ozone decomposition (creating more active species on catalyst surface), thus, improved ozone utilization (demanding relatively lower ozone addition concentration). On the other hand, this study threw light upon ozone promotion mechanism based on the comparison of catalyst properties (i.e. components, surface area, surface acidity, redox ability and oxidation state) before and after ozone treatment. The experimental results indicate that a synergistic effect exists between catalyst and ozone: ozone is captured and decomposed on catalyst surface; meanwhile, the catalyst properties are changed by ozone in return. Reactive oxygen species from ozone decomposition and the accompanied catalyst properties optimization are crucial reasons for catalyst activation at low temperature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
