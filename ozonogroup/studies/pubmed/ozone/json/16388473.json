Scarlett) was grown at two CO2 levels (400 vs. 700 ppm) combined with two ozone regimes (ambient vs. double ambient) in climate chambers for four weeks, beginning at seedling emergence. Elevated CO2 concentration significantly increased aboveground biomass, root biomass, and tiller number, whereas double ambient ozone significantly decreased these parameters. These ozone-induced reductions in growth parameters were strongly overridden by 700 ppm CO2. The elevated CO2 level increased C : N ratio of the leaf tissue and leaf starch content but decreased leaf protein levels. Exposure to double ambient ozone did not affect protein content and C : N ratio but dramatically increased leaf starch levels at 700 ppm CO2. Resistance against Drechslera teres (Sacc.) Shoemaker was increased in leaves grown at double ambient ozone but was less obvious at 700 ppm than at 400 ppm CO2. Constitutive activities of beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase were significantly higher in leaves grown at double ambient ozone compared to ambient ozone levels. The sum of methanol-soluble and alkali-released cell wall-bound aromatic metabolites (i.e., C-glycosylflavones and several structurally unidentified metabolites) and lignin contents did not show any treatment-dependent differences."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Phytopathology, Life Science Center Weihenstephan, Technical University of Munich, Am Hochanger 2, 85350 Freising, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plessl", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heller", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Payer", "ForeName": "H-D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elstner", "ForeName": "E F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Habermeyer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heiser", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16388473", "10.1055/s-2005-873002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
