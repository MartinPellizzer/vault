In this study, we present O<sub>3</sub> pollution characteristics based on one-year online measurements during 2016 at an urban site in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. Then, the sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> to its precursors during 2 O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes in August was analyzed using a box model based on observation (OBM). The relative incremental reactivity (RIR) of hydrocarbons was larger than other precursors, suggesting that hydrocarbons played the dominant role in O<sub>3</sub> formation. The RIR values for NO<sub>X</sub> ranged from -0.41%/% to 0.19%/%. The O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity was also analyzed based on relationship of simulated O<sub>3</sub> production rates with reductions of VOC and NO<sub>X</sub> derived from scenario analyses. Simulation results illustrate that O<sub>3</sub> formation was between VOCs-limited and transition regime. Xylenes and light alkenes were found to be key species in O<sub>3</sub> formation according to RIR values, and their sources were determined using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model. Paints and solvent use was the largest contributor to xylenes (54%), while petrochemical industry was the most important source to propene (82%). Discussions on VOCs and NO<sub>X</sub> reduction schemes suggest that the 5% O<sub>3</sub> control goal can be achieved by reducing VOCs by 20%. To obtain 10% O<sub>3</sub> control goal, VOCs need to be reduced by 30% with VOCs/NO<sub>X</sub> larger than 3:1."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
