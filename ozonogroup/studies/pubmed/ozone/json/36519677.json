Like other forms of organic aerosol, cooking emissions partition between gas and particle phases; a quantitative understanding of the species volatility governing this partitioning is essential to model the transport and fate of COA. However, few cooking-specific volatility measurements are available, and COA is often assumed to be semi-volatile. We use measurements from a thermodenuder coupled to an aerosol chemical speciation monitor during the HOMEChem study to investigate the chemical components and volatility of near-source COA. We found that fresh emissions of COA have three chemical components: a biomass burning-like component (COA<sub>BBOA</sub>), a lower volatility component associated with cooking oil (COA<sub>oil-2</sub>), and a higher volatility component associated with cooking oil (COA<sub>oil-1</sub>). We provide characteristic mass spectra and volatility profiles for these components. We develop a model to describe the partitioning of these emissions as they dilute through the house and outdoor atmosphere. We show that the total emissions from cooking can be misclassified in air quality studies that use semi-volatile emissions as a proxy for cooking aerosol, due to the presence of substantial mass in lower volatility bins of COA not generally represented in models. Primary emissions of COA can thus be not only primary sources of urban aerosol pollution, but also sources of semi-volatile organic compounds that undergo secondary chemistry in the atmosphere and contribute to ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA. delphine@colostate.edu."}], "LastName": "Pothier", "ForeName": "Matson A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4441-3312"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA. delphine@colostate.edu."}], "LastName": "Boedicker", "ForeName": "Erin", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4241-838X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Pierce", "ForeName": "Jeffrey R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0940-0353"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Vance", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6470-9970"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA. delphine@colostate.edu."}], "LastName": "Farmer", "ForeName": "Delphine K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36519677", "10.1039/d2em00250g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
