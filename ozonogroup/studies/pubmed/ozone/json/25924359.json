The result showed that the development of catalytic activity of RM was obtained by heating activation. The effects of different factors (heating temperature and time) have been examined in batch experiments. Sample prepared by heating RM at 400 degrees C for 4 h showed the highest activity in catalytic ozonation of NB. The temperature exhibited a significant effect on the performance of both NB removal and ozone decomposition. However, the effect of the heating time was insignificant. Experiments of both catalytic ozone decomposition and hydroxyl radical (*OH) inhibiting confirmed the existence of *OH in heated RM catalytic ozonation. According to the XRD pattern, the change of mineral content was the key reason for the development of catalytic activity, especially for hematite and magnetite."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Huanan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bingbing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Dezhi", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25924359", "10.1166/jnn.2014.8951"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
