A renewed rise in global HCFC-141b emissions was found during 2017-2020; however, the latest changes in emissions across China are unclear for this period. This study used the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model and the Bayesian framework to quantify HCFC-141b emissions based on atmospheric measurements from more sites across China than those used in previous studies. Results show that the estimated HCFC-141b emissions during 2018-2020 were on average 19.4 (17.3-21.6) Gg year<sup>-1</sup>, which was 3.9 (0.9-7.0) Gg year<sup>-1</sup> higher than those in 2017 (15.5 [13.4-17.6] Gg year<sup>-1</sup>), showing a renewed rise. The proportion of global emissions that could not be exactly traced in 2020 was reduced from about 70% reported in previous studies to 46% herein. This study reconciled the global emission rise of 3.0 \u00b1 1.2 Gg year<sup>-1</sup> (emissions in 2020 - emissions in 2017): China's HCFC-141b emissions changed by 4.3 \u00b1 4.5 Gg year<sup>-1</sup>, and the combined emissions from North Korea, South Korea, western Japan, Australia, northwestern Europe, and the United States changed by -2.2 \u00b1 2.6 Gg year<sup>-1</sup>, while those from other countries/regions changed by 0.9 \u00b1 5.3 Gg year<sup>-1</sup>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental & Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, P.
