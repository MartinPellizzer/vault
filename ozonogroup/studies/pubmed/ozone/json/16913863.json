The steady-state flux rates of these gases into the leaf are determined by a series of physical and biochemical resistances including stomatal aperture, reactions occurring within the cell wall and the ability of the leaf to remove the products of apoplastic reactions. In the present study, multiple regression models incorporating stomatal conductance, apoplastic and symplastic ascorbate concentrations, and nitrate reductase (NR) activities were generated to explain the observed variations in leaf-level flux rates of O(3) and NO(2). These measurements were made on the plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). The best-fit model explaining NO(2) flux included stomatal conductance, apoplastic ascorbate and NR activity. This model explained 89% of the variation in observed leaf fluxes and suggested physical resistances, reaction between NO(2) and apoplastic ascorbate, and the removal rate of nitrate (generated by reactions of NO(2) and water) from the apoplast all play controlling roles in NO(2) flux to leaves. O(3) flux was best explained by stomatal conductance and symplastic ascorbate explaining 66% of the total variation in leaf flux. Both models demonstrate the importance of measuring processes other than stomatal conductance to explain steady-state leaf-level fluxes of pollutant gases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-2701, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eller", "ForeName": "Allyson S D", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sparks", "ForeName": "Jed P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catharanthus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16913863", "10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01546.x", "PCE1546"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
