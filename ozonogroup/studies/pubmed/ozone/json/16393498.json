The current paper focuses on a description of use of ozone in the management of root caries and considers recent studies in this area. There has been relatively limited research into the non-invasive (pharmaceutical) management of root caries. The best management strategy still remains to be developed. Initial studies have indicated that an application of ozone for a period of either 10 or 20 seconds is capable of clinically reversing leathery root carious lesions. It is suggested that, subject to confirmation from extensive trials, this simple and non-invasive technique may benefit many patients with root caries throughout the world since this approach to treat root caries can easily be employed in primary care clinics and in the domiciliary treatment of home-bound elderly people and immobile patients in hospices and hospitals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fixed and Removable Prosthodontics, GKT Dental Institute, Guy's Tower Floor 25, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK. aylin.baysan@kcl.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baysan", "ForeName": "Aylin", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Prim Dent Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9617339", "ISSNLinking": "1355-7610"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Root Caries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16393498", "10.1308/135576106775193897"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
