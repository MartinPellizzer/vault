Two airport inventories are compared: an inventory using emissions where landing and take-off (LTO) processes are allocated to the surface (default) and a modified (3D) inventory that has LTO and cruise emissions vertically and horizontally distributed, accounting for aircraft climb and descend rates. The 3D scenario showed reduced bias and error between CMAQ and TROPOMI VCDs compared to the default scenario [i.e., normalized mean bias: -43%/-46% and root mean square error: 1.12/1.21 (1015 molecules/cm<sup>2</sup>)]. Close agreement of TROPOMI-derived observations to modeled NO<sub>2</sub> VCDs from two power plants with continuous emissions monitors was found. The net effect of aviation-related emissions was an increase in UFP (j mode in CMAQ), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (i + j mode), and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by up to 6.5 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> particles/cm<sup>3</sup> (\u223c38%), 0.7 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (\u223c8%), and 2.7 ppb (\u223c4%), respectively. Overall, the results show (1) that the spatial allocation of airport emissions has notable effects on air quality modeling results and will be of further importance as airports become a larger part of the total urban emissions and (2) the applicability of high-resolution satellite retrievals to better understand emissions from facilities such as airports."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8542-9898"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Lawal", "ForeName": "Abiola S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "Armistead G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Kaiser", "ForeName": "Jennifer", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Airports"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34931821", "10.1021/acs.est.1c03388"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
