Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular systolic function (LVSF) has great clinical utility. This study was aimed to test the hypothesis that LVSF assessed by an anesthetist using mitral valve E Point Septal Separation (EPSS) has a significant correlation with that assessed using modified Simpson's method perioperatively.", "This prospective observational study included 100 patients scheduled for elective surgeries. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed preoperatively within 24 hours of surgery by an anesthetist as per American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines. EPSS measurements were obtained in parasternal long-axis view while volumetric assessment of LV ejection fraction (EF) used apical four-chamber view. Bivariate analysis of EPSS and LV EF was done by testing Pearson correlation coefficient. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve constructed to obtain area under curve (AUC) and Youden's Index.", "The mean value of mitral valve EPSS was 7.18 \u00b1 3.95 mm. The calculated mean LV EF value using volumetric analysis was 56.31 \u00b1 11.92%. LV dysfunction as per ASE guidelines is present in 28% of patients. EPSS was statistically significantly related to LV EF negatively with a Pearson coefficient of -0.74 (P < 0.0001). AUC of ROC curve 0.950 (P < 0.0001) suggesting a statistically significant correlation between EPSS and LV EF. Youden's index of EPSS value 7 mm was obtained to predict LV systolic dysfunction.", "Mitral valve EPSS shows a significant negative correlation with gold standard LVEF measurement for LVSF estimation. It can very well be used to assess LVSF perioperatively by anesthetists with brief training."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Pooja", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Borde", "ForeName": "Deepak", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Asegaonkar", "ForeName": "Balaji", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Ozone Anesthesia Group, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Daunde", "ForeName": "Vijay", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, Narayana Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Narayana Hospitals, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Shreedhar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Fortis Hospitals, Mulund, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Jaspara", "ForeName": "Amish", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Ann Card Anaesth", "NlmUniqueID": "9815987", "ISSNLinking": "0971-9784"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anesthetists"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Echocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Mitral Valve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stroke Volume"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging"], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Dysfunction, Left"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Function, Left"}], "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Fleisher LA, Beckman JA, Brown KA, Calkins H, Chaikof E, Fleischmann KE, et al.
