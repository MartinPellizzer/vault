In this paper, the use of ozone for degrading NP from tank truck cleaning wastewater was investigated by operating a pilot-scale biological wastewater treatment in combination with an ozonation unit. The impact of the added ozonation step on the removal of NP, soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) and total organic carbon (TOC) was monitored over one year. sCOD and TOC removal were not significantly enhanced, but the NP peak concentrations in the effluent were significantly lower than those obtained after biological treatment only: a relatively low NP concentration was observed, even when peak loads were present in the influent of the pilot-scale biological wastewater treatment plant (influent<sub>bio</sub>). Contrariwise, the effluent of the sole biological treatment follows the peak load trends of the influent<sub>bio</sub>. During the ozonation period, the average NP concentration in the combined biological-ozone unit was 0.29\u00a0\u03bcg/L, compared to 1.89\u00a0\u03bcg/L for the effluent obtained after a sole biological treatment, resulting in an improved average removal efficiency of 32%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
