Excitation energies have been computed using the \u0394CC approach by directly optimizing the excited states. A fixed-reference technique has been introduced to target selected spin-states for open-shell molecular systems. The distinguishable cluster approximation consistently improves coupled cluster with singles doubles and triples results for absolute and relative energies. For excited states dominated by a single configuration state function, the fixed-reference approach combined with high-level coupled-cluster methods has a comparable accuracy to the corresponding equation-of-motion coupled-cluster methods with a negligible amount of spin contamination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["000000033460004X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schraivogel", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000272740601"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kats", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34391360", "10.1063/5.0059181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
