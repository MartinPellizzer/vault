In this study, dewaxed bamboo was heat-treated at 180\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h to investigate the emission characteristics and the formation pathways of VOCs during heat treatment by removing different main components. The results showed that aldehydes (22.61%-57.54%) and esters (14.64%-38.88%) are the primary VOCs released during heat treatment. These compounds mainly originate from the degradation of hemicellulose, lignin, cellulose, and the linkage bonds between them in bamboo. During the bamboo heat treatment, the degradation of CO, CH, and CO bonds in hemicellulose results in the release of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 3-furfural, and 1-(+)-ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate. The breakage of benzene ring group and the CO and CH bonds of lignin leading to the emission of VOCs including m-Formylphenol, Vanillin, and Syringaldehyde. The degradation of aliphatic CH, CC, and CO bonds in the amorphous region of cellulose contributes to an enhanced release of alcohols, olefins, and alkanes. It is calculated that acids (28.92%-59.47%), esters (10.10%-22.03%) and aldehydes (17.88%-39.91%) released during heat treatment contributed more to Ozone Formation Potential (OFP)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
