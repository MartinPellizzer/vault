It appears that the treatment may activate the host's immune system by inducing the production of immunoactive cytokines and it may now be possible to rationalize the procedure, improve the regimen and assess the outcome. It is apparent, however, that such a therapeutic approach, in order to be acceptable, requires an investigative effort of biologists and clinicians. Once this is done, owing to the large range of medical applications and the simplicity of the procedure, autohemotherapy could become very valuable particularly in underdeveloped countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of General Physiology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Siena, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bocci", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Hypotheses", "NlmUniqueID": "7505668", "ISSNLinking": "0306-9877"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Transfusion, Autologous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1435389", "10.1016/0306-9877(92)90136-z", "0306-9877(92)90136-Z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
