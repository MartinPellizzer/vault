We calculated and compared the ozone effective height H<sub>eff</sub> and effective temperature T<sub>eff</sub>, which are two important parameters in ground-based total ozone retrieval through the use of various profile datasets. This is used to verify the accuracy of the operative values (H<sub>eff(0)</sub>\u202f=\u202f23\u202fkm, T<sub>eff(0)</sub>\u202f=\u202f-46.3\u202f\u00b0C (or -45\u202f\u00b0C)) from the World Meteorological Organization. The results show that the deviation of MLS and AIRS ozone profiles from ozone sounding data has significant oscillation and scatter in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The average difference of MLS at 82.5\u202fhPa is (80.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f65.1) %, and that of AIRS at 70 and 100\u202fhPa are (105.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f74.9) % and (107.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f67.8) %, respectively. The two satellite temperature profiles have differences within \u00b13\u202f\u00b0C and can effectively describe the vertical distribution and variation of temperature. When calculating the H<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>eff</sub>, upper stratospheric data missing from the sounding data must be filled in by the satellite profile data; otherwise the calculated results will show large errors of 3.2\u202fkm and 3.3\u202f\u00b0C. The H<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>eff</sub> at Kunming are respectively 24.36 to 25.51\u202fkm and -48.3 to -43.6\u202f\u00b0C. The operational H<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>eff</sub> used at Kunming ozone observation station clearly do not conform to the actual situation and must be corrected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
