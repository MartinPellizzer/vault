A statistical model is fit to a collection NO<sub>2</sub> plumes observed from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and is used to calculate top-down NO<sub>X</sub> emissions. Decreases in OMI-derived NO<sub>X</sub> emissions are observed across the eight cities from 2006 to 2017 (-17% in Miami to -58% in Los Angeles), and are generally consistent with long-term trends of bottom-up inventories (-25% in Miami to -49% in Los Angeles), but there are some interannual discrepancies. City-specific NO<sub>X</sub>-to-CO<sub>2</sub> emission ratios, used to calculate inferred CO<sub>2</sub>, are estimated through annual bottom-up inventories of NO<sub>X</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions disaggregated to 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fkm<sup>2</sup> resolution. Over the study period, NO<sub>X</sub>-to-CO<sub>2</sub> emission ratios have decreased by ~40% nationwide (-24% to -51% for our studied cities), which is attributed to a faster reduction in NO<sub>X</sub> when compared to CO<sub>2</sub> due to policy regulations and fuel type shifts. Combining top-down NO<sub>X</sub> emissions and bottom-up NO<sub>X</sub>-to-CO<sub>2</sub> emission ratios, annual fossil-fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are derived. Inferred OMI-based top-down CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trends vary between +7% in Dallas to -31% in Phoenix. For 2017, we report annual fossil-fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to be: Los Angeles 113\u202f\u00b1\u202f49 Tg/yr; New York City 144\u202f\u00b1\u202f62 Tg/yr; and Chicago 55\u202f\u00b1\u202f24 Tg/yr. A study in the Los Angeles area, using independent methods, reported a 2013-2016 average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions rate of 104 Tg/yr and 120 Tg/yr, which suggests that the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from our method are in good agreement with other studies' top-down estimates. We anticipate future remote sensing instruments - with better spatial and temporal resolution - will better constrain the NO<sub>X</sub>-to-CO<sub>2</sub> ratio and reduce the uncertainty in our method."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
