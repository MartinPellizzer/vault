Effect of solar intensity, ozone flow and ultrasonic power dissipation on the extent of viscosity reduction has been investigated for individual treatment approaches. The combined approaches such as US+solar, solar+O3, solar+H2O2, US+H2O2 and US+O3 have been subsequently investigated under optimum conditions and established to be more efficient as compared to individual approaches. Approach based on US (60W)+solar+H2O2 (0.01%) resulted in the maximum extent of viscosity reduction as 98.97% in 35min whereas operation of solar+H2O2 (0.01%), US (60W), H2O2 (0.3%) and solar irradiation resulted in about 98.08%, 90.13%, 8.91% and 90.77% intrinsic viscosity reduction in 60min respectively. Approach of US (60W)+solar+ozone (400mg/h flow rate) resulted in extent of viscosity reduction as 99.47% in 35min whereas only ozone (400mg/h flow rate), ozone (400mg/h flow rate)+US (60W) and ozone (400mg/h flow rate)+solar resulted in 69.04%, 98.97% and 98.51% reduction in 60min, 55min and 55min respectively. The chemical identity of the treated polymer using combined approaches was also characterized using FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectra and it was established that no significant structural changes were obtained during the treatment. Overall, it can be said that the combination technique based on US and solar irradiations in the presence of hydrogen peroxide is the best approach for the depolymerization of PAA solution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
