Among the principal results is the fact that, as the polar vortex elongated, it became hydrodynamically unstable, and this insta-, bility affected the upper troposphere and stratosphere. During the major, sudden stratospheric warming, the middle stratospheric vortex split into two pieces; one piece rapidly mixed with extra vortex air, while the other returned to the pole as a much weaker and smaller vortex. The polar night jet was considerably weaker than normal, and was displaced more poleward than has been observed in previous winters, resulting from a series of wave events (propagated from the troposphere) that took place over the course of the winter. Finally, the relative ozone decrease (increase) in the eastern Antarctic is tightly associated with westerly (easterly) zonal wind anomalies near the southern tip of South America, and the unusual behavior of the ozone hole in 2002 therefore appears to be caused by great easterlies in this region.", "The main conclusion is that the southern polar vortex and the diminutive ozone hole split into two parts in September 2002, due to the prevalence of very strong planetary waves, led to the appearance of a major, sudden stratospheric warming. Although there is evidence that sea surface temperature anomalies contributed to the excitation of the quite strong planetary waves over Antarctica in 2002, there is not yet a widely approved mechanism supporting that.", "The appearance of the near-record size of the 2003 ozone hole confirmed that the 'no-ozone-hole' episode observed in the year 2002 does not denote a recovery of the ozone layer. Despite the current successful attempts to get a sufficient understanding for the genesis of both extraordinary events, more observations and further modeling efforts are necessary to more reliably assess the contribution of various dynamic mechanisms to the recently observed tropo-stratospheric surprises."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Athens, Department of Applied Physics, Panepistimiopolis, GR-157 84 Athens, Greece. kvarots@cc.uoa.gr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varotsos", "ForeName": "Costas", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "NumberOfReferences": "45"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2002;9(6):375-6", "ArticleIdList": ["12515343"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2003;10(2):80-1", "ArticleIdList": ["12729038"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2004 Jan 22;427(6972):289-91", "ArticleIdList": ["14737143"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15603531", "10.1007/BF02979661"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
