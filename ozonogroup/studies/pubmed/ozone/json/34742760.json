This study presents a kinetic model to describe the reaction of ozone with squalene on indoor surfaces in a family house, by incorporating external and internal mass transfer, surface partitioning, and chemical reaction on indoor surfaces. Field experiments were performed in the family house. The first 3-days of data, collected when the house was unoccupied, are used to derive the key parameters in the model, which are then used for predicting the concentrations in other unoccupied days. Comparison of squalene oxidation products during the occupied and unoccupied periods shows that even if the house is unoccupied for several days, the indoor concentrations of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA) remain substantial, demonstrating that surface reaction of ozone with off-body squalene can significantly impact the composition of indoor air. Model predictions of the three compounds (ozone, 6-MHO, and 4-OPA) agree well with the experimental observations for all test days. Furthermore, we make the first attempt to estimate the duration of typical polyunsaturated aldehydes (TOP, TOT, and TTT), which indicated that these compounds, as well as off-body squalene, can persist on indoor surfaces for a relatively long period in the examined residence."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
