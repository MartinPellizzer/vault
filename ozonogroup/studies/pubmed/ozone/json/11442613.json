The disadvantages of this kind of evaporative cooling are the cost and, in the case of dichlorodifluoromethane, the effects on the ozone layer. Cold air is an innovative cooling method that costs nearly nothing to use, is environmentally friendly, and can be easily adapted to existing laser systems.", "To examine and evaluate cold air cooling as an alternative method of cooling in laser treatment.", "In a prospective study, 13 patients (9 female, 4 male) with port-wine stains were treated with a pulsed dye laser (lambda = 585 nm, tau(p) = 450 microsec). In every case, either the entire area or a sample area of the port-wine stain was treated with cold air cooling on 50% of the surface and without on the other 50%. Clearance, analgesia, and adverse and concomitant effects were assessed.", "In nine patients (69%) there were similar results in terms of clearance. In four cases, better lightening results (in two patients) and worse lightening results (in two other patients) were achieved in the area treated with cold air. Nine of the patients (69%) felt that the laser impulses accompanied by cold air were significantly less painful. Adverse effects (purpura, erythema, edema) and concomitant effects (hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, scars) were much less marked in the cooled areas.", "Cold air is a safe and effective alternative to cryogen spray cooling. It is easy to use, economical, and environmentally friendly. Continuing studies are necessary to determine if there are interactions which affect the tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laserklinik Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greve", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hammes", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raulin", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dermatol Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "9504371", "ISSNLinking": "1076-0512"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Laser Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "radiotherapy"], "DescriptorName": "Port-Wine Stain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11442613", "10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00352.x", "dsu00352"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
