Whereas the ambient air inhibited growth of Aphis fabae, it stimulated population growth of Phyllaphis fagi. In Fagus, analysis of a phloem exudate revealed that the amino acid/sugar ratio was significantly increased by the ambient air compared to filtered air. In Phaseolus, no significant differences in amino acid or sugar content of the phloem exudate could be found. Acid mist inhibited population development in both aphid species; the strongest effect was observed in the first weeks after artificial infestation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Applied Plant Biology, CH-4124 Sch\u00f6nenbuch, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braun", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fl\u00fcckiger", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092475", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90036-5", "0269749189900365"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
