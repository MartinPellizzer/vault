The solar UV-B background radiation in this area is occasionally extremely high (8 microW/cm2). Such high background solar UV-B radiation could be attributed to the sporadic depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The excessive UV-B radiation is a potential hazard in the environment. This prompted the present study on the effect of UV-B radiation on the cytogenetic damage to pollen mother cells of the plant Tradescantia. The Tradescantia-micronucleus (Trad-MCN) test was used to determine the genotoxicity of UV-B radiation. In addition to the usual 10 h of solar emission of UV light a series of increasing dosages (2, 4, 6, 8 h) of artificial UV-B radiation was applied to Tradescantia (clone 3) plant cuttings. Inflorescences of the treated and control plants were fixed and used for preparation of microslides. Micronuclei frequencies were observed in the early tetrads to show the degree of genotoxicity. Results of two repeated experiments show a dose-related increase of MCN frequencies under normal sunshine days. In the third experiment conducted under a cloudy and rainy day and an extraordinary high solar UV-B background, the MCN frequencies were markedly higher than that of the negative control but did not show the clear dose response to the treatment as in the first two experiments. The Trad-MCN test has successfully detected the effect of artificial UV-B radiation over the solar UV-B background radiation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10350589", "10.1016/s0027-5107(99)00059-7", "S0027-5107(99)00059-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
