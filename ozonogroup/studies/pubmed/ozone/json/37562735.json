Focusing on Guangzhou, a megacity of South China, we established an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with micro detectors to collect consecutive high-resolution samples of fine particle (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), submicron particle (PM<sub>1.0</sub>), black carbon (BC) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations in the atmosphere, as well as the air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH) within a 500\u00a0m altitude during nighttime from Oct. 24th to Nov. 6th, 2018. The measurements showed that PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>1.0</sub>, and BC decreased with altitude and were influenced by the nighttime shallow planetary boundary layer (PBL) where BC was more accumulated and fluctuated. In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> was positively correlated with altitude. Backward trajectory clustering and Pasquill stability classification showed that advection and convection significantly influenced the vertical distribution of all pollutants, particularly particulate matter. External air masses carrying high concentrations of pollutants increased PM<sub>1.0</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels by 145% and 455%, respectively, compared to unaffected periods. The ratio of BC to PM<sub>2.5</sub> indicated that local emissions had a minor role in nighttime particulate matter. Vertical transport caused by atmospheric instability reduced the differences in pollutant concentrations at various heights. Geodetector and generalized additive model showed that RH and BC accumulation in the PBL were significant factors influencing vertical changes of the secondary aerosol intensity as indicated by the ratio of PM<sub>1.0</sub> to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The joint explanation of RH and atmospheric stability with other variables such as BC is essential to understand the generation of secondary aerosols. These findings provide insights into regional and local measures to prevent and control night-time particulate matter pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
