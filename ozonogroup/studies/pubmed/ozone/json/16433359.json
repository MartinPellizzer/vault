To assess these effects quantitatively, an August-September 2000 photochemical episode in southeast Texas was simulated using the comprehensive air quality model, with extensions (CAMx). During this episode, ambient measurements of a unique marker of atmospheric chlorine chemistry, 1-chloro-3-methyl-3butene-2-one (CMBO), were made and model performance was assessed by comparing modeled and observed CMBO mixing ratios. The model predicted ambient CMBO mixing ratios within the uncertainty limits associated with the emissions inventory, so the model was used to assess the impacts of chlorine chemistry on ozone formation. Based on the current emissions inventory, chlorine emissions have the potential to enhance 1-h-averaged ozone mixing ratios by 70 ppb, in very localized areas, during morning hours. Over wider areas, and at times of day when peak ozone concentrations are observed, the impacts of chlorine emissions on ozone concentrations are typically less than 10 ppb. Chlorine emissions also influenced changes in ozone concentrations due to hydrocarbon and NOx emission controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Energy and Environmental Resources, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78758, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Sunghye", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "David T", "Initials": "DT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Butanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16433359", "10.1021/es050787z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
