Pulmonary problems such as asthma, pulmonary inflammation, hyper-responsiveness of airways and higher susceptibility to infections are reported as the result of occupational exposure of welders to ozone and nitrogen oxides. Potent oxidizing agents like ozone and nitrogen oxides are also reported to be a precursor for respiratory problems and cause lipid peroxidation of membranes.", "A total of 43 nonsmoking MIG and TIG welders and 41 nonsmoking workers without appreciable exposure to any chemicals as the control population were chosen to participate in this study. Occupational exposure to ozone was monitored according to the validated methods. Malondialdehyde (MDA) of blood serum as a biomarker for lipid peroxidation was analyzed using Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Data obtained from this study were analyzed using t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis.", "A total of 88.4% and 74.4% of welders had exposure to ozone and nitrogen dioxide higher than the permissible limit of occupational exposure, respectively. Generally, exposure of MIG welders to ozone was significantly higher than TIG welders (P = 0.006). However, exposure to nitrogen dioxide gas was comparable in both groups. Serum MDA of welders was significantly higher than that of the control group (P = 0.001). A significant correlation was detected between ozone exposure and level of serum malondialdehyde. Such correlation was not observed for nitrogen dioxide exposure.", "Considering the high exposure of welders to ozone and nitrogen dioxide, and higher level of serum malondialdehyde in them compared to controls, risk management is recommended for this group of workers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azari", "ForeName": "Mansour R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Bojnord University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Esmaeilzadeh", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehrabi", "ForeName": "Yadollah", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salehpour", "ForeName": "Sousan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Tanaffos", "NlmUniqueID": "101308232", "ISSNLinking": "1735-0344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Han SG, Kim Y, Kashon ML, Pack DL, Castranova V, Vallyathan V.
