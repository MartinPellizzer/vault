In this study, we overcame this conflict by developing new dielectric heterocaking (HC) filters, in which high relative dielectric constant (\u03b5<sub>r</sub>) materials were heterogeneously loaded on traditional polymer fibers. The dielectric HC filters in an electrostatic polarizing field generate a great amount of charges on their surface, leading to a strong attraction to precharged aerosol particles, and result in high filtration efficiency. Observing <i>via</i> a charged coupled device camera, the migration speed of aerosol smoke particles toward the polarized HC fiber exceeded those toward the unpolarized HC fiber by a factor of 6. We loaded high-\u03b5<sub>r</sub> HCs including manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), activated carbon, zinc oxide (ZnO), copper oxide (CuO), and barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) on polyurethane foams using a fast and large-scale roll-to-roll gel squeezing method. Based on the experimental results, when HCs had a \u03b5<sub>r</sub> larger than 5.1, an increased \u03b5<sub>r</sub> did not benefit electrostatic filtration efficiency for aerosol particles much, but resulted in a larger net ozone production. We suggested a MnO<sub>2</sub>-HC filter for efficient and multifunctional filtration of indoor particles, ambient ozone, and formaldehyde with only 3.8 Pa pressure drop at 1.1 m/s filtration velocity. This efficient and cost-effective dielectric HC filter opens a new avenue for the design of multifunctional filters, which will facilitate its large-scale production and commercial application in the ventilation system for healthy buildings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6410-5360"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Enze", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Fanxuan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jiandong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9175-7890"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yinping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7841-8058"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ju", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2882-3802"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3178-6507"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Jinhan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32498504", "10.1021/acsami.0c07447"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
