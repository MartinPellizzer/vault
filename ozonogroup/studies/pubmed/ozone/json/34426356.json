It affects plants by reducing green leaf area and leading to necrosis, lesions and chlorosis, resulting in yield loss. Four mungbean cultivars were used to study O 3 sensitivity under elevated O 3 concentrations in the range of 70-100 ppb in an O 3 open-top chamber during the growing season. Based on O 3 response mechanisms, we classified mungbean cultivars into two groups: (1) O 3 -sensitive cultivars (Chainat 3 and 4) and (2) O 3 -tolerant cultivars (Chainat 84-1-1 and Kampangsan 2). The most O 3 -sensitive cultivars (Chainat 4) had the highest visible injury symptoms and the lowest in plant biomass. This evidence was due to Chainat 4 had lower ascorbic acid, indole acetic biosynthesis protein, defence related protein related to antioxidant systems, attribute to higher H 2 O 2 accumulation and an increase in salicylic acid contents. In contrast to the most O 3 -tolerant cultivars (Chainat 84-1-1) which had higher ascorbic acid levels, an upregulation of defence related protein, especially ascorbic acid biosynthesis and regenerate, indole acetic acid and jasmonic acid biosynthesis protein resulting in balanced H 2 O 2 levels, lower salicylic acid accumulation and little visible injury under elevated O 3 concentrations. Therefore, we conclude that the increased abundance of indole acetic acid, antioxidant related proteins facilitating stomata physiology in O 3 -tolerant under O 3 stress. This is the first report of the responses of mungbean cultivars in Thailand to elevated O 3 concentrations, facilitating the selection of suitable cultivars and the biomonitoring of O 3 levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
