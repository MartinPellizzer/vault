During the degradation of nitrobenzene by O3/ UV, addition of MnO2, an effective catalyst to decompose H2O2 in water, decreased the degradation efficiency obviously, and the degradation efficiency of O3 /UV was even lower than that of ozonation alone, for example, the TOC removal rates of nitrobenzene by O3 /UV, O3 and O3/UV + MnO2 were 44% , 41% and 39% in 40 minutes, respectively. These results demonstrate that intermediate H2O2 plays an important role in enhancement of degradation efficiency of O3/UV. Furthermore, the characteristic of organic, which acts as promoter or inhibitor in the process of ozonation, also affects the degradation efficiency of O3/UV directly, when glycolic acid, a promoter in ozonation, was degraded, the combination UV radiation with ozonation could remove it efficiency, the removal rate of glycolic acid reached 76% in 30 minutes; however, when acetic acid, an inhibitor in ozonation, was degraded by O3/UV, the removal rate of acetic acid was very low, which was similar with that of ozonation alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China. sptong@zjut.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Shao-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Chun-An", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycolates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0WT12SX38S", "NameOfSubstance": "glycolic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycolates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17489194"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
