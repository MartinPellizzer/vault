They are often carelessly released into natural environment and thus constantly posing a potential threat to human health. However, because of lack of effective ways of degrading PCBs, researchers are still striving to explore new approaches to remove them from the environment. In this work, we employed atmospheric-pressure non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma to treat 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77) in aqueous solution and investigated the removal efficiency under different DBD conditions using different discharging gases. As a result, we showed that He-DBD had the highest removal efficiency with hydroxyl radical playing the major role in the degradation, while O<sub>2</sub>-DBD also gave rise to relatively high efficiency with ozone making an important contribution. After 2\u00a0min of treatments by He-DBD and O<sub>2</sub>-DBD, over 75% of PCB77 was degraded with removal rate of 23.65\u00a0mg/L and 22.19\u00a0mg/L per minute, respectively. Besides, the toxicological evaluation for the DBD treatment was also provided, confirming that the PCB77 degradation products had negligible biotoxicity. This work therefore provides a new effective approach to treatment of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
