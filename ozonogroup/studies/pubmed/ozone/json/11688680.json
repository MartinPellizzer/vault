Organic iodine measurements were used as a surrogate for triiodinated benzene derivatives. Seven wastewater treatment facilities in Texas, Arizona and California were studied and organic iodine concentrations at these facilities varied between 5 and 40 microg iodine/L. The highest concentrations were observed on weekdays reflecting the common practice of employing X-ray examinations between Monday and Friday. Organic iodine compounds in secondary treated effluents were not removed by advanced wastewater treatment using ozone. However, organic iodine was efficiently removed by reverse osmosis membrane treatment. Based on laboratory biodegradation experiments and field studies negligible removal occurred under aerobic redox conditions while anoxic conditions led to partial removal of organic iodine. However, a concentration range of 8-15 microg iodine/L was observed in groundwater recharge systems after travel times of 8 to 10 years. Beside appropriate redox conditions, bioavailable organic carbon seems to be a key factor for organic iodine biodegradation in the environment. No environmental risk is expected from the parent compounds of triiodinated contrast media, however, toxicological effects associated with the metabolites are unknown."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Sustainable Water Supply, Arizona State University, Tempe 85287-5306, USA. jdrewes@asu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drewes", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fox", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jekei", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contrast Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arizona"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Contrast Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11688680", "10.1081/ese-100106248"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
