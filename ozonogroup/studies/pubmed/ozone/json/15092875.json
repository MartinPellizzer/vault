The gradient and eddy correlation methods were compared and showed similar diel v(d) patterns. Daytime F(c) was correlated with CO(2) and water vapour fluxes, while no correlation between [O(3)] in the range 10-70 ppb (nl l(-1)) and F(c) was seen in this study. F(c) was primarily driven by stomatal conductance, reactions with surfaces, particles and gases, and not by [O(3)]. On a monthly basis, [O(3)] was always highest in the afternoon while v(d) was typically higher in the morning, resulting in an equal F(c) over the day. Night-time F(c) was more than half of the daytime O(3) flux. The data reveal the importance of emissions of nitric oxide and terpenes as O(3) removal factors in evergreen forest dominated by Norway spruce."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biology and Biogeochemistry Department, Risoe National Laboratory, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark. teis.mikkelsen@risoe.dk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mikkelsen", "ForeName": "T N", "Initials": "TN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ro-Poulsen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pilegaard", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hovmand", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jensen", "ForeName": "N O", "Initials": "NO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christensen", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hummelshoej", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092875", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00045-2", "S0269-7491(00)00045-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
