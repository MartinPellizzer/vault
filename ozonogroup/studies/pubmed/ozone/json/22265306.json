Inoculated samples were treated at 15.5, 31, and 62\u00a0W for 2-60\u00a0s inside sealed linear-low-density-polyethylene bags containing 30% oxygen and 70% argon. Treatments resulted in a reduction of L.\u00a0innocua ranging from 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 to 1.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 log\u00a0cfu/g with no significant effects of time and intensity while multiple treatments at 15.5 and 62\u00a0W of 20\u00a0s with a 10\u00a0min interval increased reduction of L.\u00a0innocua with increasing number of treatments. Concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) increased with power, treatments and storage time and were significantly higher than those of control samples after 1 and 14 days of storage at 5\u00a0\u00b0C. However, the levels were low (from 0.1 to 0.4\u00a0mg/kg) and beneath the sensory threshold level. Surface colour changes included loss of redness of \u223c40% and 70% after 1 and 14 days of storage, respectively, regardless of plasma treatment. The results indicate that plasma may be applicable in surface decontamination of pre-packed RTE food products. However, oxidation may constitute an issue in some products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
