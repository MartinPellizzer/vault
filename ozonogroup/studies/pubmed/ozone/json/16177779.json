This trend is inconsistent with the simulated response to greenhouse-gas and sulphate-aerosol changes, but it has been proposed that other climate influences--such as ozone depletion--could account for the discrepancy. Here I compare observed Northern Hemisphere sea-level pressure trends with those simulated in response to all the major human and natural climate influences in nine state-of-the-art coupled climate models over the past 50 years. I find that these models all underestimate the circulation trend. This inconsistency suggests that we cannot yet simulate changes in this important property of the climate system or accurately predict regional climate changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Climatic Research Unit, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK. n.gillett@uea.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gillett", "ForeName": "Nathan P", "Initials": "NP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nature", "NlmUniqueID": "0410462", "ISSNLinking": "0028-0836"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Human Activities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16177779", "10.1038/437496a", "437496a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
