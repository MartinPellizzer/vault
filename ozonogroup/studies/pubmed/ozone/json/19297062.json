O3 flux modelling was performed using continuously recorded O3 concentrations in combination with meteorological and soil moisture data collected from Level II forest sites. O3 measurements at nearby rural open-field sites proved appropriate as surrogates in cases where O3 data were lacking at forest sites (with altitude-dependent average differences of about 10% between O3 concentrations). Operational thresholds of biomass loss for both O3 indices were exceeded at the majority of the forest locations, suggesting similar risk under long-term average climate conditions. However, exposure-based indices estimated higher O3 risk during dry years as compared to the flux-based approach. In comparison, minor O3-like leaf injury symptoms were detected only at a few of the forest sites investigated. Relationships between flux-based risk thresholds and tree response need to be established for mature forest stands for validation of predicted growth reductions under the prevailing O3 regimes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "WIDI, Wissenschaftsdienste, Ecological Science Services, Ortsstrasse 23, D-85354 Freising, Germany. manuela.baumgarten@alice-dsl.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baumgarten", "ForeName": "Manuela", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huber", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00fcker", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emberson", "ForeName": "Lisa", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dietrich", "ForeName": "Hans-Peter", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nunn", "ForeName": "Angela J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heerdt", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beudert", "ForeName": "Burkhard", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "Rainer", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19297062", "10.1016/j.envpol.2009.02.012", "S0269-7491(09)00079-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
