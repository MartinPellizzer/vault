Mean eight hourly ozone concentration varied from 52 to 73 ppb which was found to produce adverse impacts on plant functioning and growth characteristics. The palak plants were treated with 300 ppm EDU at 10 days after germination at 10 days interval up to the plant maturity. Lipid peroxidation in EDU treated plants declined significantly as compared to non-EDU treated ones. Significant increment in F(v)/F(m) ratio in EDU treated plants as compared to non-EDU treated ones was recorded. EDU treated plants showed significant increment in ascorbic acid contents and reduction in peroxidase activity as compared to non-EDU treated ones. As a result of the protection provided by EDU against ozone induced stress on biochemical and physiological characteristics of palak, the morphological parameters also responded positively. Significant increments were recorded in shoot length, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area and root and shoot biomass of EDU treated plants as compared to non-EDU treated ones. Contents of Na, K, Ca, Mg and Fe were higher in EDU treated plants as compared to non-EDU treated ones. The present investigation proves the usefulness of EDU in partially ameliorating ozone injury in ambient conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi 221 005, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "Supriya", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Madhoolika", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54924-46-8", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene diurea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Beta vulgaris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19286241", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.02.034", "S0045-6535(09)00182-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
