The three aromatic VOCs demonstrated high reactivity during ozonation and were eliminated within minutes after ozone addition. The high reactivity is attributed to their fast, indirect OH radical reactions with k(OH,M) of (5.3-6.6) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1). Rates of aromatic VOC degradation are in the order 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene > p-cymene > bromobenzene. This order is caused by the selectivity of the direct ozone reactions (k(O3,M) ranges from 0.16 to 304 M(-1) s(-1)) and appears to be related to the electron-donating or -withdrawing ability of the substituent groups on the aromatic ring. The removal rates for the five aliphatic VOCs are much lower and are in the order 1,1-dichloropropane > 1,3-dichloropropane > 1,1-dichloroethane > 2,2-dichloropropane > 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. The second-order indirect rate constants for the aliphatic VOCs range from 0.52 x 10(8) to 5.5 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). The relative stability of the carbon-centered intermediates seems to be related to the relative reactivity of the aliphatic VOCs with OH radicals. Except for 1,3-dichloropropane, ozonation and the O3/H2O2 AOP are not effective for the removal of other aliphatic VOCs. Bromide formation during the ozonation of bromobenzene indicates that bromate can be formed, and thus, ozonation and O3/H2O2 AOP may not be suitable for the treatment of bromobenzene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Environmental Science and Engineering Program, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wei R", "Initials": "WR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharpless", "ForeName": "Charles M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linden", "ForeName": "Karl G", "Initials": "KG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suffet", "ForeName": "I H", "Initials": "IH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16683616", "10.1021/es051961m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
