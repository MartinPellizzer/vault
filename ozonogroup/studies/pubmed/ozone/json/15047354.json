Acid Orange 7. Operation parameters such as ultrasonic power density, ozone flow, UV intensity, and type and injection mode of the bubbling gas were optimized based on the rate of absorption decay in the visible and UV bands as estimated by regression analysis of absorption-time data. At equivalent initial dye concentrations and contact times, individual effects of UV irradiation, ultrasound and ozone were \"no effect\", \"bleaching\", and \"bleaching/organic carbon degradation\", respectively. UV irradiation, however, was found to induce a catalytic effect when applied in combination with either ultrasound or ozone schemes; and the overall degradation process was most rapid under simultaneous operation of the three in the presence of a continuous flow of a gas mixture made of argon and oxygen. The synergy observed in combined schemes was attributed to enhanced ozone diffusion by mechanical effects of ultrasound, and the photolysis of ultrasound-generated H(2)O(2) to produce hydroxyl radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Sciences, Bogazi\u00e7i University, 34342 Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tezcanli-G\u00fcyer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ince", "ForeName": "N H", "Initials": "NH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ultrasonics", "NlmUniqueID": "0050452", "ISSNLinking": "0041-624X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15047354", "10.1016/j.ultras.2004.01.096", "S0041624X04000976"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
