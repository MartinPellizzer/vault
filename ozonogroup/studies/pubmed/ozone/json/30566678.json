Common in Africa and Asia, it is a quarantine insect for much of the rest of the world where methyl bromide has traditionally been used for its control. However, this ozone-depleting fumigant is now heavily restricted, and alternate methods of control are required. In a two-step process, we examined the use of high-temperature exposure as one such method of control. First, different life stages were held at 45\u00b0C for different periods to calculate LT50 (lethal time to 50% mortality) values. In descending order, the most heat-tolerant life stages at 45\u00b0C were diapausing larvae (LT50 = 41 - 122 h) > nondiapausing larvae (LT50 = 47 h) > adults (LT50 = 33 h) > pupae (LT50 = 25 h) > eggs (LT50 = 10 h). Second, diapausing larvae (the most heat-tolerant stage) were held at 45, 50, 55, and 60\u00b0C for different periods to calculate LT50, LT95, LT99, and probit 9 (99.9968% mortality) values. Estimated LT99 values for diapausing larvae were 288 h at 45\u00b0C, 6 h at 50\u00b0C, 1.1 h at 55\u00b0C, and 1 h at 60\u00b0C. Based on these results, an exposure of 2 h at 60\u00b0C is recommended to control T. granarium with high temperatures. To meet requirements for control of quarantine pests, exposure of between 2 and 12 h at 50-60\u00b0C is recommended to cause probit 9 mortality, but additional experiments are needed to get a better estimate of probit 9."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Crown copyright 2018."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lethbridge Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilches", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laird", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lethbridge Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Floate", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Morden Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fields", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Econ Entomol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985127R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0493"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30566678", "10.1093/jee/toy379", "5251958"]}}]}
