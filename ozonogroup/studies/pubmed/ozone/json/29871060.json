Data on daily sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082), particulate matter of diameter smaller than 10 micrometer (PM-10) and particulate matter of diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5), the average of ozone (O\u2083) per 8 hours was available as average values derived from the data of 6 state controlled monitoring stations distributed across Pudong district, Shanghai. We quantified IFN-\u03b3 (interferon-\u03b3) gene specific DNA methylation levels in CD4\u207a T cells from 35 patients with AR and 30 healthy controls. mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b3 gene were measured by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Methods of personal exposure assessment of PM2.5 and PM10 were measured. <b>Result:</b>Compared with control, IFN-\u03b3 promoter region was hypermethylated in AR CD4\u207a T cells (<i>P</i><0.05). Of all observed CpG sites in IFN-\u03b3 promoter region, there were significant differences in CpG\u207b\u00b2\u2079\u2079, CpG\u207a\u00b9\u00b9\u2079, CpG\u207a\u00b9\u2076\u2078 (<i>P</i>=0.004, <i>P</i>=0.029, <i>P</i>=0.035). IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression was significantly increase in CD4\u207a T cells (<i>P</i><0.05). The level of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression was negatively correlated to mean level of methylation in IFN-\u03b3 promoter region. After adjusting, level of long exposure PM2.5 was positively correlated with level of methylation in IFN-\u03b3 promoter region. <b>Conclusion:</b>Level of methylation in IFN-\u03b3 promoter region may be affected by long exposure PM2.5."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Meteorological Bureau."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "B Y", "Initials": "BY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, MOE-Shanghai Key Laboratory of Children's Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Lin Chuang Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "101303164", "ISSNLinking": "2096-7993"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29871060", "10.13201/j.issn.1001-1781.2016.07.004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
