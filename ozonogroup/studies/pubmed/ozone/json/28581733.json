The inability of current global models to accurately calculate NO<sub>x</sub> levels, and concurrently, difficulties in performing direct NO<sub>x</sub> measurements in low-NO<sub>x</sub> regimes (several pptv or several tens of pptv) globally introduce a large uncertainty in the modeling of O<sub>3</sub> formation. Here, we use the near-explicit Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.2) within a 0D box-model framework, to describe the chemistry of NO<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the remote marine boundary layer at Cape Verde. We explore the impact of a recently discovered NO<sub>x</sub> recycling route, namely photolysis of particulate nitrate, on the modeling of NO<sub>x</sub> abundance and O<sub>3</sub> formation. The model is constrained to observations of long-lived species, meteorological parameters, and photolysis frequencies. Only a model with this novel NO<sub>x</sub> recycling route reproduces levels of gaseous nitrous acid, NO, and NO<sub>2</sub> within the model and measurement uncertainty. O<sub>3</sub> formation from NO oxidation is several times more efficient than previously considered. This study highlights the need for the inclusion of particulate nitrate photolysis in future models for O<sub>3</sub> and for the photolysis rate of particulate nitrate to be quantified under variable atmospheric conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, and \u2021National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Leeds , Leeds, LS2 9JT, U.K."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5417-2671"], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Chunxiang", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, and \u2021National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Leeds , Leeds, LS2 9JT, U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heard", "ForeName": "Dwayne E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, and \u2021National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Leeds , Leeds, LS2 9JT, U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whalley", "ForeName": "Lisa K", "Initials": "LK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cabo Verde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28581733", "10.1021/acs.est.6b06441"]}}]}
