Long-term NO<sub>2</sub> exposure is harmful to human health. The NO<sub>2</sub> pollution in China has surpassed developed countries and attracts international attention. To understand the spatial and temporal distributions of NO<sub>2</sub> across Chengdu in Southwest China, a random forest (RF) model was developed based on NO<sub>2</sub> environmental monitoring data, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals, and geographic covariates. The RF model showed good performance with a cross validation R<sup>2</sup> of 0.77, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.0\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. The ground-level NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of Chengdu for 2005-2016 were predicted using the developed model with the multiyear population weighted NO<sub>2</sub> concentration being 41.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.7\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. The predicted NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations exhibited a clear seasonal variation trend with winter being the highest and summer being the lowest. Furthermore, higher NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the downtown areas were observed than that in the rural areas indicating the former being attributed to more anthropogenic sources. The population weighted NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations with deseasonlization were relatively high during 2011-2013. The NO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased at a rate of 0.81\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>/year before 2011 (43.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.2\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and decreased at a rate of\u00a0-1.03\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>/year after 2013 (44.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.8\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
