Conventional ozonation and EO were effective in degrading the aromatic moiety of NOM characterized by the absorbance at 254\u00a0nm. Yields of aliphatic carboxylic acids in the ozone treated water were dominated by formate, acetate and oxalate, while no acetate was observed in the case of EO treatment. The speciation of aldehydes was similar in the case of ozonation and EO treatment, but the aldehydes yields were notably higher for ozonation. The presence of the elevated carbonate concentration moderated the changes in disinfection by-products (DBPs) concentration in the EO treated water due to the interception of \u2219OH by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, while it did not affect ozonation treatment. This study allows gaining more insights into the nature of processes characteristic and optimization of disinfections based on ozonation and EO methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
