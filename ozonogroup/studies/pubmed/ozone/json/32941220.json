A new technique should be detected with fewer side effects which improves the speed of the healing. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of topical ozonated oil on the healing of bone defects created in rat calvarium.", "Defects of 7\u200amm were induced with a trephine in the calvaria of 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were divided into 3 groups, and the defects in each group were filled with ozonated oil, olive oil, or left empty as a control. The animals were euthanized at 3 different time points (14, 28, and 42 days post-operation). Histological and serological (alkaline phosphatase) assessments were carried out on 14, 28, and 42 days post-operation.", "On 14 and 28 days post-operation, in the edges of the defect, there was a significant difference between the ozonated oil group and olive oil as well as control groups (P \u2264 0.05). However, in the center of the defect, there were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). On day 42, in the edges and center of the defect, there was a significant difference between the ozonated oil group and olive oil as well as control groups statistically (P \u2264 0.05).", "The results of this study indicate the potential efficacy of ozonated oil as a bone substitute in a rat calvarial defect model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 by Mutaz B.
