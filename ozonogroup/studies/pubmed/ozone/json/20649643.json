Low soil pH influences the relative amount of N\u2082O produced and consumed by denitrification. Furthermore, denitrification is strongly inhibited in pure cultures of denitrifying microorganisms below pH 5. Soils, however, have been shown to denitrify at pH values as low as pH 3. Here we used a continuous bioreactor to investigate the possibility of significant denitrification at low pH under controlled conditions with soil microorganisms and naturally available electron donors. Significant NO\u2083\u207b and N\u2082O reduction were observed for 3 months without the addition of any external electron donor. Batch incubations with the enriched biomass showed that low pH as well as low electron donor availability promoted the relative abundance of N\u2082O as denitrification end-product. Molecular analysis of the enriched biomass revealed that a Rhodanobacter-like bacterium dominated the community in 16S rRNA gene libraries as well as in FISH microscopy during the highest denitrification activity in the reactor. We conclude that denitrification at pH 4 with natural electron donors is possible and that a Rhodanobacter species may be one of the microorganisms involved in acidic denitrification in soils."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Water and Wetland Research, Department of Microbiology, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van den Heuvel", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van der Biezen", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jetten", "ForeName": "M S M", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hefting", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kartal", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100883692", "ISSNLinking": "1462-2912"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Bacterial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denitrification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthomonadaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20649643", "10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02301.x", "EMI2301"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
