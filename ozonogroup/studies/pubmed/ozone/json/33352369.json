Here, the role of high-energy electron, ozone in TiO<sub>2</sub> charge carrier generation and transfer process has been investigated using phenol as the probe molecule. The introduction of electron-trapping agent (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) have an inhibiting effect on TiO<sub>2</sub> catalytic activity, indicating high-energy electrons played a significant role in TiO<sub>2</sub> catalytic process. EPR analysis showed that TiO<sub>2</sub> could be activated to initiate pairs of electron-hole by high-energy electrons from plasma, and the electrons on the conduction band (CB) could be trapped on the oxygen vacancies. XPS analysis showed that the Ti<sup>3+</sup>OH species formed during discharge process due to the capture of CB electrons by Ti<sup>4+</sup>OH groups located at the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface. The CB electrons transfer processes on TiO<sub>2</sub> surface was strongly dependent on the redox potential of electron acceptors, which adsorbed on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface. The CB electrons can be transferred to dissolved O<sub>3</sub>, resulting in more OH production. Meanwhile, the CB electron also transferred to benzoquinone adsorbed on TiO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in accumulation of hydroquinone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
