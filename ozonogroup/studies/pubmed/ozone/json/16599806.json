The processes that lead to their formation are varied and include fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, and mechanical stress and wear of carbonaceous materials. In this review, we examine recent work on the structure and composition of carbon aerosol particles, and we describe how they react with the atmospherically abundant gases ozone, oxygen, sulfur dioxide, nitric acid, and nitrogen oxides. The study of carbon particles in the laboratory has shown that chemical reactivity depends strongly on the type of carbon used and on experimental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The variability in the results demonstrates the difficulty in extrapolating laboratory results to atmospheric conditions and in explaining the role of carbon particles in processes such as global warming and environmental chemical cycling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. nienow@chem.umn.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nienow", "ForeName": "Amanda M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roberts", "ForeName": "Jeffrey T", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Annu Rev Phys Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "15040080R", "ISSNLinking": "0066-426X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16599806", "10.1146/annurev.physchem.57.032905.104525"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
