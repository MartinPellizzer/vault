The calculations include absorption and scattering of UV-radiation in the atmosphere, both for normal ozone conditions as well as for a depleted ozone layer. For Scandinavian latitudes the effective annual UV-dose increases by approximately 4% per degrees of latitude towards the Equator. An ozone depletion of one percent increases the annual UV-dose by approximately 1% at 60 degrees N (increases slightly at lower latitudes). A large depletion of 50% over Scandinavia (60 degrees N) would give these countries an effective UV-dose similar to that obtained, with normal ozone conditions, at a latitude of 40 degrees N (California or the Mediterranean countries). The Antarctic ozone hole increases the annual UV-dose by 20 to 25% which is a similar increase as that attained by moving 5 to 6 degrees of latitude nearer the Equator. The annual UV-dose at higher latitudes is mainly determined by the summer values of ozone. Both the ozone values and the effective UV-doses vary from one year to another (within +/- 4%). No positive or negative trend is observed for Scandinavia from 1978 to 1988."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dahlback", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henriksen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larsen", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stamnes", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2755998", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.1989.tb08433.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
