In the YRD, Shanghai had the highest frequency of DHP at 7.6%, while Anhui had the least (2.1%). DHP mostly occurred in the northwest and along the Yangtze River in the east of the YRD, especially in spring (April) and autumn (October). MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> level was relatively higher during DHP than HOP, while PM<sub>2.5</sub> level was relatively higher during HPP than DHP. In 2015-2019, the total number of DHP events decreased in the YRD, but the changes in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations showed great spatial variations. DHP was often associated with a weak pressure field, under meteorological conditions with east winds, temperatures of 18.7-26.1 \u00b0C, relative humidity of 65.7-77.1%, sea level pressure of 1008.2-1019 hPa, wind speed of 1.4-2.4 m/s, and visibility of 3.1-7.5 km. Water-soluble ions (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) were the dominant components of PM<sub>2.5</sub> during DHP at Nanjing and Changzhou City in 2019. Although the fraction of those ions during DHP and HPP were similar, the secondary conversion of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> was stronger in HPP. The concentrations of those ions were lowest in HOP, with a higher fraction of sulfate than the other two types of pollution. The conversion of SO<sub>2</sub> to sulfate was easier to occur than that of NO<sub>2</sub> to nitrate under all the polluted conditions in the two cities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
