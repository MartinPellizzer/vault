This study examined how outdoor worker demographics, risk perceptions, and efficacy beliefs predict air quality protective actions and information seeking. Additionally, it investigates the sources of information that this population relies on for understanding air quality.", "A survey was conducted with 256 outdoor workers in Colorado, a state regularly affected by wildfire smoke and ozone. Measures included demographics, perceived risk, efficacy beliefs, air quality actions, and information seeking behavior.", "Both perceived risk and efficacy beliefs influenced health-protective actions during poor air quality events. Interestingly, efficacy beliefs were found to be a more reliable predictor of air quality information seeking than perceived risk. The top sources of air quality information among outdoor workers were local news media, The Weather Channel, mobile apps, state public health authorities, and the National Weather Service.", "These findings enhance our understanding of how perceived risk and efficacy beliefs promote health-protective behaviors among outdoor workers. They lay the groundwork for future research and initiatives to improve air quality communication and promote health-protective actions for this population group. Promoting the efficacy of health-protective actions and seeking information are important components of air quality communication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8636-1154"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Journalism and Media Communication, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States."}], "LastName": "Bice", "ForeName": "Channing", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Journalism and Media Communication, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States."}], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Ashley A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Journalism and Media Communication, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States."}], "LastName": "Abrams", "ForeName": "Katie M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Journalism and Media Communication, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Marilee", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Commun Healthc", "NlmUniqueID": "101489047", "ISSNLinking": "1753-8068"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Information Seeking Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorado"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wildfires"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "57"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38380671", "10.1080/17538068.2024.2320478"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
