The <sup>\u2022</sup>OH yield provides the absolute <sup>\u2022</sup>OH formation during ozonation. However, the conventional \"tert-Butanol (<i>t-</i>BuOH) assay\" cannot accurately determine the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH yield since the propagation reactions are inhibited, and there have been few studies on <sup>\u2022</sup>OH production induced by EfOM fractions during ozonation. Alternatively, a \"competitive method\", which added trace amounts of the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH probe compound to compete with the water matrix and took initiation reactions and propagation reactions into account, was used to determine the actual <sup>\u2022</sup>OH yields (<b>\u03a6</b>) compared with that obtained by the \"<i>t-</i>BuOH assay\" (<b>\u03c6</b>). The <b>\u03a6</b> were significantly higher than <b>\u03c6</b>, indicating that the propagation reactions played important roles in <sup>\u2022</sup>OH formation. The chain propagation reactions facilitation of EfOMs and fractions can be expressed by the chain length (<i><b>n</b></i>). The study found significant differences in <b>\u03a6</b> for EfOMs and fractions, precisely because they have different <i><b>n</b></i>. The actual <sup>\u2022</sup>OH yield can be calculated by <i><b>n</b></i> and <b>\u03c6</b> as <b>\u03a6</b> = <b>\u03c6</b> (1 + <i>n</i>)/(<b><i>n</i>\u03c6</b> + 1), which can be used to accurately predict the removal of micropollutants during ozonation of wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Lab for Source Control
