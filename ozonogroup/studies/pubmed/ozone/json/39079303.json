This study constructed random forest regression models using multi-source data from ground measurements and meteorological satellites to predict variations in ground-level O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and their influencing factors across seven major cities in the Tibetan Plateau over two-year periods. The models successfully reproduced O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels with satisfactory R-squared values of 0.71 and 0.73, respectively. Results reveal combustion-related carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) as the most substantial influences on O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. Solar radiation, geographical factors, and meteorological variables also played crucial roles in driving pollutant variations. Conversely, transport-related and human activity factors exhibited relatively lower significance. High O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution occurred during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon/winter seasons, driven by solar radiation and emissions, respectively. While CO consistently contributed across cities and seasons, key influencing factors varied locally. This study unveils the key driving forces governing air pollutant variations across the Tibetan Plateau, shedding light on complex atmospheric processes in this unique high-altitude region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
