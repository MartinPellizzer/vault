The originality of this study was to investigate the effect of two novel disinfection techniques on the surface hardness of resin-based endodontic sealers using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Forty extracted single-rooted maxillary central human teeth were prepared and divided into four groups according to treatment methods. The first group was irrigated with saline and served as a control, other groups irrigated with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO); gaseous ozone; and light-activated disinfection (LAD). The groups were divided into two subgroups, according to the obturation method used: subgroup A: gutta-percha and AH plus; and subgroup B: EndoREZ/resin-coated cones. After obturation, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was performed to analyze the surface hardness of the sealers. There was a significant difference between group 1A and group 3A (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Group 3B had the highest surface hardness values that were statistically different (p\u2009<\u20090.05). When disregarding the sealers, the ozone possessed statistically higher surface hardness values than the other groups in all root thirds (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The use of ozone and LAD may alter the surface hardness of resin-based sealers. The use of AFM can be considered an alternative hardness test techonology for sealing material."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Tuncay", "ForeName": "\u00d6znur", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Er", "ForeName": "\u00d6zg\u00fcr", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Demirbuga", "ForeName": "Sezer", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zorba", "ForeName": "Yahya Or\u00e7un", "Initials": "YO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Top\u00e7uo\u011flu", "ForeName": "H\u00fcseyin Sinan", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Scanning", "NlmUniqueID": "7903371", "ISSNLinking": "0161-0457"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Root Canal Filling Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mechanical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Atomic Force"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Filling Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25931289", "10.1002/sca.21222"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
