The photoinduced reactive species (RS) from DOM, primarily including the excited triplet state of DOM (<sup>3</sup>DOM*), singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), and hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH), play important roles in the attenuation of contaminants. However, the effect of disinfection processes on the photosensitized degradation of contaminants is poorly understood. This paper presents the first evidence that <sup>3</sup>DOM*, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH interaction with three typical contaminants (diphenhydramine, cimetidine, and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET)) was largely impacted by DOM after disinfection. The results of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry and laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments demonstrated that the chlorination increased the formation rate of <sup>3</sup>DOM* and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, while UV<sub>254</sub> irradiation and ozonation decreased the formation rate of these RS. All these three disinfection processes promoted the photoproduction of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and increased the photodegradation rate constants (k<sub>obs</sub>) of DEET by 26-361%. The k<sub>obs</sub> of diphenhydramine, cimetidine, and DEET correlated positively with the formation rate of <sup>3</sup>DOM*, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, respectively. The bimolecular reaction rate constant of <sup>3</sup>DOM* with diphenhydramine increased by \u223c41% after chlorination. These findings suggest that disinfection processes altered the photogeneration of RS from DOM, which significantly impacts the fate of trace pollutants in aquatic environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
