Infected wounds were induced on the back of the rats, and at 48 h of infection, chlorhexidine or ozone water was applied once daily for 9 days. Before and at days 3, 6, and 9 of the treatment, the wound changes were observed. The WBC in the tail venous blood was detected and the incised skin and muscular tissues were pathologically examined.
