However, the specific variations in complex odors and odorants along the course of advanced treatments in full-scale drinking water treatment plants (DWTP) have remained unclear. In this paper, the migration of odors and odorants through pre-ozonation, sedimentation, post-ozonation, and BAC treatment processes were studied from January to December 2019 in a DWTP. The results indicated that septic, musty, and chemical odors with intensities of 6-6.7, 6-7.5, 4-5 could be removed by both ozonation and BAC, while grassy, fishy odors with intensities of 3.3-4.8, 2.3-5.8 could not be removed until the BAC step. Twenty-four odorants identified in raw water were classified as musty (2-methylisoborneol, geosmin), chemical (e.g. indane, eucalyptol), septic (e.g. dimethyl disulfide, pentanethiol), fishy (2,4-decadienal) and grassy (nonanal, decanal) odor compounds. It is noteworthy that eleven additional odorants were produced after ozonation; in addition, the concentrations of fishy and grassy odorants were increased after ozonation, and the concentrations of musty, septic, fishy, and grassy odorants were increased after sedimentation, suggesting that sedimentation and ozonation should be carefully managed. BAC was the most effective at removing the above odorants simultaneously. This study would be helpful for providing more insights into the migration of odorants along treatment processes and understanding the mitigation of odors in DWTPs using raw waters with complex odors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
