Almost the complete removal of antibacterials was attained with all oxidation processes, which were combined with a pretreatment of manure with magnesium (Mg(2+)) salt desorption. Among the investigated oxidation processes, thermally activated persulfate oxidation with 25 mM Na(2)S(2)O(8) at 50 degrees C was also applied to the animal feeding operations wastewater, and the pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants of OTC and SMZ were found as 3.22 and 1.25 (1/h), respectively. Thermally activated persulfate treatment resulted in the reduction of 82% inhibition of OTC and SMZ to 7%, indicating the production of almost nontoxic degradation products in the wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Sciences, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uslu", "ForeName": "Merih Otker", "Initials": "MO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balcio\u011flu", "ForeName": "I\u015fil Akmehmet", "Initials": "IA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "48U51W007F", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X20I9EN955", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytetracycline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxytetracycline"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethazine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19902944", "10.1021/jf902188j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
