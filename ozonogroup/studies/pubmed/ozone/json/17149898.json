Contrary to expectations, functionalization leads to a decrease in specific surface area compared to that of the unfunctionalized nanotubes. Treatment with a concentrated 1:1 nitric/sulfuric acid mixture followed by high-temperature baking at 1000 degrees C was found to increase the specific surface area of the nanotubes. For the unfunctionalized SWNTs, this treatment increases the specific surface area (SSA) by 20%. In the case of SWNTs functionalized by n-butyl groups the increase in the SSA was nearly 2-fold with the value increasing from 410 (drying at 110 degrees C) to 770 m2/gm (acid and bake treatment followed by drying at 110 degrees C). For the ozonized SWNTs, the SSA increases more than 3-fold from 381 (drying at 110 degrees C) to 1068 m2/gm (acid and bake treatment followed by drying at 110 degrees C). SEM images indicate that the nanotubes rebundle in the solid state with an average bundle size of 10-30 nm. AFM studies show that the ozonized tubes have been cut to short bundles after ozonolysis. Hydrogen uptake studies carried out on the baked ozonized tubes led to a 3 wt % hydrogen uptake at 77 K and 30 bar."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and The Richard E.
