In the USA, significant reductions of O<sub>3</sub> precursors-nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-have not yielded proportionate decreases in O<sub>3</sub>. NO<sub>x</sub> is a major precursor of O<sub>3</sub> as well as a quencher of O<sub>3</sub> through NO<sub>x</sub> titration, which is especially important during the night and wintertime. In this study, we investigated the potential dual impact of NO<sub>x</sub> concentration decreases on recent O<sub>3</sub> trends by season and time of day. We analyzed hourly O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> measurement data between 1994 and 2010 in the continental USA. Nationally, hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations decreased by as much as -0.38 ppb/year with a standard error of 0.05 ppb/year during the warm season midday, but increased by as much as +0.30\u00b10.04 ppb/year during the cold season. High O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (\u226575th percentile) during the warm season decreased significantly, however, there were notable increases in the cold season as well as warm season nighttime; we found that these increases were largely attributable to NO<sub>x</sub> decreases as less O<sub>3</sub> is quenched. These O<sub>3</sub> increases, or \"penalties\", related to NO<sub>x</sub> reductions remained robust at a wide range of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (5th to 99th percentile), and even after accounting for VOC reductions and meteorological parameters, including temperature, wind speed, and water vapor pressure. In addition, we observed O<sub>3</sub> penalties across rural, suburban, and urban areas. Nonetheless, peak O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (99.9th percentile) were mitigated by NO<sub>x</sub> reductions. In addition, there was some suggestive evidence that VOC reductions have been more effective in reducing O<sub>3</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, 401 Park Drive, Landmark 4 West (Rm 412J), Boston, MA 02215, USA."}], "LastName": "Jhun", "ForeName": "Iny", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, 655 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}], "LastName": "Coull", "ForeName": "Brent A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, 401 Park Drive, Landmark 4 West (Rm 412J), Boston, MA 02215, USA."}], "LastName": "Zanobetti", "ForeName": "Antonella", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, 401 Park Drive, Landmark 4 West (Rm 412J), Boston, MA 02215, USA."}], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "Petros", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P01 ES009825", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Air Qual Atmos Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101317801", "ISSNLinking": "1873-9318"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Barmpadimos I, Keller J, Oderbolz D, Hueglin C, Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t ASH.
