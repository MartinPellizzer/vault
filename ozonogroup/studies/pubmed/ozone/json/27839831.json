Batch tests with addition of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) stock solutions and semi-batch tests with continuous O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> gas sparging (simulating real ozone contactors) were conducted to investigate O<sub>3</sub> decomposition, \u2022OH production, MIB and geosmin abatement, and bromate formation during the two processes. Results show that with specific ozone doses typically used in routine drinking water treatment (0.5-1.0\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), conventional ozonation could not adequately abate MIB and geosmin in a surface water. While increasing the specific ozone doses (1.0-2.5\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC) could enhance MIB and geosmin abatement by conventional ozonation, this approach resulted in significant bromate formation. By installing a carbon-based cathode to electrochemically produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from cathodic oxygen reduction, conventional ozonation can be conveniently upgraded to an E-peroxone process. The electro-generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> considerably enhanced the kinetics and to a lesser extent the yields of hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) from O<sub>3</sub> decomposition. Consequently, during the E-peroxone process, abatement of MIB and geosmin occurred at much higher rates than during conventional ozonation. In addition, for a given specific ozone dose, the MIB and geosmin abatement efficiencies increased moderately in the E-peroxone (by \u223c8-9% and \u223c10-25% in the batch and semi-batch tests, respectively) with significantly lower bromate formation compared to conventional ozonation. These results suggest that the E-peroxone process may serve as an attractive backup of conventional ozonation processes during accidental spills or seasonal events such as algal blooms when high ozone doses are required to enhance MIB and geosmin abatement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
