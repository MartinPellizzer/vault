We investigated the molecular tracers for different types of SOA in PM<sub>2.5</sub> under varying NO/NO<sub>2</sub> conditions in Guangzhou using source analysis of particle-phase speciated organics obtained from an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO-I-CIMS). Results show that low-NO-like pathways (when NO/NO<sub>2</sub> < 0.2) explained \u223c75% of the total measured FIGAERO-OA during regional transport periods, which was enriched in more-oxidized C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> non-nitrogenous compounds over ozone accumulation. Daytime high-NO chemistry played larger roles (38%) in local pollution episodes, with organic nitrates (ONs) and nitrophenols increasing with enhanced aerosol water content and nitrate fraction. Nighttime NO<sub>3</sub>-initiated oxidation, characterized by monoterpene-derived ONs, accounted for comparable percentages (10-12%) of FIGAERO-OA for both two periods. Furthermore, the presence of organosulfates (OSs) improves the understanding of the roles of aqueous-phase processes in SOA production. Carbonyl-derived OSs exhibited a preferential formation under conditions of high aerosol acidity and/or abundant sulfate, which correlated well with low-NO-like SOA. Our results demonstrate the importance of NO/NO<sub>2</sub> ratios in controlling SOA compositions, as well as interactions between water content, aerosol acidity, and inorganic salts in gas-to-particle partitioning of condensable organics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental
