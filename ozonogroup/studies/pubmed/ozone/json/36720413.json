Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) identified four emission source factors of VOCs along with equivalent black carbon (eBC), gaseous pollutants (CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>) and ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>): (1) secondary aerosol precursors, (2) evaporation and non-LPG fuel combustion, (3) geogenic source and (4) vehicle exhaust. Propylene Equivalent and Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) methods identified isoprene and ethylene as the highest oxidant and O<sub>3</sub> forming species. Pollutant data normalized to the variation of the PBLH revealed continued production of O<sub>3</sub> precursors in the afternoon beyond the typical morning rush hour. In particular this could be observed during the second part of the measurement period (12-15 March) when a strong O<sub>3</sub> episode occurred under weak wind and lower PBLH conditions compared to the preceding period (6-11 March) when well mixed conditions due to elevated daytime PBLH and strong advection led to overall reduced pollutant mixing ratios in the afternoon hours."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
