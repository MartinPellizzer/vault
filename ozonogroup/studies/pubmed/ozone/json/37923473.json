In this study, emission characteristics, ozone formation potential (OFP) and health risk of fugitive VOCs in 7 representative industries were investigated. Chemical material industry was the dominant contributor to VOCs of fugitive emission in comparison with other industries. The OFP of VOCs from fugitive emission was in the range of 1.45\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup>-3.98\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, with a higher value than that of organized emission in seven industries except for the coking industry and the chemical material industry, suggesting that fugitive VOCs should be taken into account while developing control strategies. Acetaldehyde, m,p-xylene, n-nonane, ethylene, vinyl chloridethe and other high OFP-contributing species were the major reactive species that should be targeted. Health risk assessment investigated non-cancer and cancer risks of fugitive VOCs in 7 industries were all above safe level (HR > 1 and LCR > 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup>), posing remarkable health threats to human health. OVOCs were the main contributor to non-cancer risk, while halohydrocarbons and aromatics contributed most to cancer risks, posing remarkable health threat on human health. Our findings highlighted the contribution of fugitive VOCs on ozone formation and health risk was underestimated, indicating which should be considered in emission control strategies of industrial sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
