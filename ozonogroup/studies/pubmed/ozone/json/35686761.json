The observations in this study showed that high O<sub>3</sub> concentration in spring and summer of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was higher in the south and lower in the north. The high O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang was often accompanied by the influence of southern wind. Based on WRF-Chem model simulation and process analysis technology, the variation characteristics and causes of O<sub>3</sub> in The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in 2019 were deeply analyzed. The diurnal variations in chemical processes, vertical mixing, and transportation in typical cities showed distinct seasonal variations. In summer afternoons, chemical processes were the main source of O<sub>3</sub> concentration increase in each city. Vertical mixing resulted in an increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang but a decrease in Beijing. Tianjin and Shijiazhuang had a net output, whereas Beijing had a net inflow. In the polluted O<sub>3</sub> process, the chemical process dominated the afternoon O<sub>3</sub> concentration increasing in Beijing and Shijiazhuang, whereas vertical mixing dominated in Tianjin. In addition, there was a net input of O<sub>3</sub> in Beijing and Shijiazhuang and a net output of O<sub>3</sub> in Tianjin. In the clean O<sub>3</sub> process, vertical mixing dominated the increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Beijing and Shijiazhuang in the afternoon, whereas in Tianjin it was chemical processes. At the same time, the net output of O<sub>3</sub> existed in all three cities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ying-Xiao", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zi-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Wen-Yan", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Su-Qin", "Initials": "SQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35686761", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202109146"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
