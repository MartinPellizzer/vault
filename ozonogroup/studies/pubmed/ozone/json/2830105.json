The rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by type II cells, monitored by the incorporation of [Me-14C]choline, was impaired by ozone at concentrations that did not affect other cellular parameters. The enzymes choline kinase and cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase were not susceptible to inactivation by ozone at concentrations at which the activity of glycerolphosphate acyltransferase was decreased. The enzyme activity of lactate dehydrogenase increased after ozone exposure. The specific activity of choline kinase in the cytosolic fraction of type II cells was fivefold that in whole lung. The metabolism of [Me-14C]choline was studied as a function of the choline concentration. Maximal rates of phosphatidylcholine synthesis were already attained at a concentration of 20 microM choline. Exposure of type II cells to ozone did not affect the recovery of label from [Me-14C]choline in choline phosphate and CDP choline. However, the maximal rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis decreased after ozone exposure, which indicates that the decreased apparent activity of glycerolphosphate acyltransferase limits the supply of diacylglycerols and thereby the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. If the flux through the diacylglycerol pathway was stimulated by the addition of palmitic acid, a higher maximal rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis was observed. The uptake of [Me-14C]choline and the recovery of label in CDPcholine were not altered by the addition of different concentrations of palmitate. It is concluded that type II cells take up choline very efficiently, probably due to the high specific activity of choline kinase. At low choline concentrations the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis is determined by the supply of CDPcholine. At concentrations of choline in the upper physiological range, the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis is determined by the availability of diacylglycerols, which in turn is limited by the apparent activity of glycerolphosphate acyltransferase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Veterinary Biochemistry, Utrecht University, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haagsman", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schuurmans", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Batenburg", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Golde", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Palmitic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2V16EO95H1", "NameOfSubstance": "Palmitic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.15", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.32", "NameOfSubstance": "Choline Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleotidyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.15", "NameOfSubstance": "Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N91BDP6H0X", "NameOfSubstance": "Choline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Choline"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Choline Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleotidyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Palmitic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Palmitic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2830105", "10.3109/01902148809062847"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
