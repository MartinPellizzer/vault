The representative CaMn<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> oxides show a hierarchical spherical structure constructed by crystalline nanorods and numerous macropores. They possess mixed Mn<sup>4+</sup>/Mn<sup>3+</sup> chemical valences and abundant surface hydroxyl (OH) groups. The ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) decomposition rate on the CaMn<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> catalysts is greatly accelerated and follows the first-order law. These catalysts are promising for the degradation of phenolic compounds via catalytic ozonation, exhibiting rapid pseudofirst-order degradation kinetics, a high total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency and an excellent stability. Under optimized conditions (a low O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 1.5\u202fmg/min and a catalyst dosage of 7.5\u202fg/L), for the treatment of concentrated phenol (50-240\u202fmg/L), the CaMn<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> catalysts show 100% degradation and 50-70% mineralization within 1.0\u202fh. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are essential to create redox Mn<sup>4+</sup>/Mn<sup>3+</sup> couples and to significantly reduce manganese leaching. High surface ratios of Mn<sup>4+</sup>/Mn<sup>3+</sup> and OH/lattice oxygen (O<sub>lat</sub>) are beneficial for enhancing the catalytic performance. Superoxide anion free radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) are the predominant reactive species for the oxidation degradation. The O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> reaction pathway is proposed. Specifically, the surface OH sites activate O<sub>3</sub>, displaying highly enhanced decomposition rates. The generated O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> play a role in oxidation. The redox Mn<sup>4+</sup>/Mn<sup>3+</sup> and the O<sub>lat</sub>/oxygen vacancy (O<sub>lat</sub>/O<sub>vac</sub>) couples play important roles in electron transfer. The proposed mechanism is supported by active site probing, radical scavenging, spectroscopic studies, and the results in the degradation of substituted phenols."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
