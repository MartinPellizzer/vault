Despite its effectiveness on the abatement of organic micropollutants (OMPs) and disinfection, previous studies have shown that regrow of bacteria may occur upon storage of the ozonated UWW. This reactivation has been attributed to the high content of assimilable organic carbon after treatment. In order to investigate if ozonation by-products are the main biological regrowth drivers in stored ozonated UWW, the ozonation surviving cells were resuspended in sterile bottled mineral water (MW), simulating a pristine oligotrophic environment. After 7 days storage, organisms such as Acinetobacter, Methylobacterium, Cupriavidus, Massilia, Acidovorax and Pseudomonas were dominant in both ozonated UWW and pristine MW, demonstrating that bacterial regrowth is not strictly related to the eventual presence of ozonation by-products, but instead with the ability of the surviving cells to cope with nutrient-poor environments. The resistome of UWW before and after ozonation was analysed by metagenomic techniques. Draft metagenome assembled genomes (dMAGs), recovered from both ozonated UWW and after cell resuspension in MW, harboured genes conferring resistance to diverse antibiotics classes. Some of these antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were located in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements, suggesting their potential to be mobilized. Among these, dMAGs affiliated to taxa with high relative abundance in stored water, such as P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., harboured ARGs conferring resistance to 12 and 4 families of antibiotics, respectively, including those encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases. The results herein obtained point out that the design and development of new wastewater treatment technologies should include measures to attenuate the imbalance of the bacterial communities promoted by storage of the final treated wastewater, even when applying processes with high mineralization rates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
