The membrane flux and ozone dosage were optimized for the optimal treatment performance of this integrated process. The results showed that this integrated process performed well in pollutant removal. The concentrations of COD<sub>Cr</sub>, phosphate and color in the effluents were 17.9\u00a0mg/L, 0.25\u00a0mg/L, and 5 dilution times in average, respectively. The effluent quality met the local discharge standard even under a high influent COD concentration (195\u00a0mg/L in average). The synergistic effect of the ozonation and ceramic membrane filtration was investigated through the fluorescence characteristics and hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of organic compounds. It revealed that ozonation mitigated the membrane fouling and the nanopores in the ceramic membranes enhanced the ozonation efficiency. Meanwhile, the Fenton process had a slightly better effluent quality than the integrated process, but Fenton process consumed much more chemicals and required the sludge disposal, resulting in higher cost. The estimated unit cost for this integrated process was only 34% of that for the Fenton process. Overall, the integrated process demonstrated high stability, reliable effluents and low cost, providing a promising and cost-efficient technology for the treatment of hypersaline petrochemical wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
