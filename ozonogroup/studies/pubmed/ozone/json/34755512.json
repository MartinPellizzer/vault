The possible hydrogen atom and cyano group abstraction reaction pathways were studied, and the calculated thermochemical parameters show that the hydrogen atom abstraction from the C7 carbon atom is the more favorable reaction pathway. The subsequent reactions for the favorable intermediate (<b>I4</b>) with other atmospheric reactive species, such as O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7, and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>\u00b7 (<i>x</i> = 1, 2), were studied in detail. The products identified from the subsequent reactions could contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in the atmosphere. The intermediates and products formed from the initial and subsequent reactions are equally as toxic as the parent sulfoxaflor. At 298 K, the rate constant calculated for the formation of the favorable intermediate <b>I4</b> is 2.54 \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, which shows that the lifetime of sulfoxaflor is 54 h. The excited-state calculation performed through time-dependent density functional theory shows that the photolysis of the title molecule is unlikely in the atmosphere. The global warming potentials (GWPs) for different time horizons, photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), and ecotoxicity analysis were also studied for the insecticide sulfoxaflor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore 641 046, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Manonmani", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9055-096X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies, New Delhi 110012, India."}], "LastName": "Sandhiya", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3420-8163"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore 641 046, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Senthilkumar", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "671W88OY8K", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfoxaflor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34755512", "10.1021/acs.jpca.1c05030"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
