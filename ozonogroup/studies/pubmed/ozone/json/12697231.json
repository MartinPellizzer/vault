Despite the structural differences among the Fluka, Aldrich and Suwanee River humic acids as reflected by the UV absorptivity, their effects on nitrobenzene removal rate was observed to be similar for the two processes. Removal rate of nitrobenzene was hindered by the addition of humic acids in ozonation as well as in O(3)/UV processes. However, the hindrance by the humic acids was more pronounced in O(3)/UV as compared to the ozonation process. The effect of humic acid in O(3)/UV was primarily a UV light screening. Addition of humic acids above a certain concentration did not cause any further retardation on nitrobenzene removal rate by ozonation and O(3)/UV. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide as well as probable formation of peroxy radicals in the solutions might induce chain promoting reactions to produce hydroxyl radical during the nitrobenzene oxidation. For waters containing high levels of humic acid, ozonation alone might be as effective as O(3)/UV process for the removal of nitrobenzene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Department, Hacettepe University, Beytepe, Ankara 06532, Turkey. aysegull@hacettepe.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Latifoglu", "ForeName": "Aysegul", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurol", "ForeName": "Mirat D", "Initials": "MD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12697231", "10.1016/S0043-1354(02)00583-3", "S0043-1354(02)00583-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
