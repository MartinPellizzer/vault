After measuring the burden of each disease, the total burden of disease related to climate change was assessed by multiplying population-attributable fractions. Finally, an estimation model for the burden of disease was built based on Korean climate data.", "The total burden of disease related to climate change in Korea was 6.85 DALY/1000 population in 2008.
