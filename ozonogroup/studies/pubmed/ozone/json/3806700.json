Male C3H/He mice were exposed to 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 ppm ozone for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 d. After the exposure periods, the mice were infused intravenously with NR-FS cells. At 2 wk postinfusion, the lungs were examined for colony development of metastasis. A significantly higher rate of pulmonary metastasis than that of normal mice was observed in the ozone-exposed mice. The enhancement of metastasis due to ozone exposure varied with length of exposure and concentration of ozone. When 1 X 10(5) cells of NR-FS were injected into the tail veins of mice, the maximal enhancement (459%) of pulmonary metastasis was observed in the mice exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone for 1 d. A longer period of exposure to 0.8 ppm ozone also enhanced pulmonary metastasis, although the prolonged exposure (14 d) gradually suppressed the enhancement (268%). In the mice exposed to the lower concentration of ozone, a lower rate of the lung matastasis was observed; even in the mice exposed to 0.1 ppm ozone for the period of from 1 to 14 d, a significantly higher rate of metastasis than that of nonexposed mice was observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Todoroki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["secondary"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrosarcoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3806700", "10.1080/15287398709530967"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
