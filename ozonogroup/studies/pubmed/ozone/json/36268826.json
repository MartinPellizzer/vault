Morphology engineering and metal doping are, together, one of the most effective methods to enhance catalytic activity for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition. Herein, a topochemical transformation route to Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanospheres composed of 2D nanosheets is first provided by using layered \u03b2-MnOOH as the precursor. Then, silver nanoparticles are deposited over the Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanosheets <i>via</i> a redox reaction without any extra reducing agents. In comparison with Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with a conventional octahedral morphology, the prepared Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanosphere (Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-NF), and its Ag-doped composite, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Ag (Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Ag-NF), both retain the morphology of \u03b2-MnOOH, and display better reducibility and higher oxygen vacancies. The best catalytic performance for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition is found over Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Ag-NF, which exhibits \u223c88.5% removal efficiency within 24 h at a space velocity of 600 L g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> and a relative humidity of 50% at room temperature. This work emphasizes the advantages of nanosheet morphology and metal doping in optimizing the catalytic activity for O<sub>3</sub> elimination of manganese oxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Clean Chemistry Technology of Guangdong Regular Higher Education Institutions, School of Chemical Engineering and Light Industry, Guangdong University of Technology, 510006 Guangzhou, P.
