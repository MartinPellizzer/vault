The solids were thoroughly characterized by SEM/EDS, N<sub>2</sub> physisorption, XRD, FTIR, Pyridine-FTIR, TEM and XPS. We demonstrated that the solid precursor calcined at 300\u202f\u00b0C exhibited the best catalytic ozonation activity with respect to CuAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel phase obtained at higher temperatures. Such performance was attributed to the better textural properties and a higher density of active sites (hydroxyl groups and Lewis acidity). Specifically, the mixed oxide/O<sub>3</sub> process allows to reach a near complete color removal of the dye solution (100\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>) in 25\u202fmin at neutral pH. Corresponding reaction rate value was measured at 0.112\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup> and was clearly higher compared with the single oxide ozonation process (0.071\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup> for CuO/O<sub>3</sub> and 0.074\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup> for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>). Then, we proposed that such catalytic performance was related to a synergistic function between \u2261Cu<sup>2+</sup> and \u2261Al<sup>3+</sup>, which took part of a mechanism of radical formation. In such mechanism, present \u2261Al<sup>3+</sup> could act as a reservoir for surface active sites such as hydroxyl groups and Lewis acid sites, while \u2261Cu<sup>2+</sup> could provide the possibility of electron transfer with ozone for the enhancement of radical generation. We suggested that the interaction between chemisorbed ozone and surface hydroxyl groups initially stabilized on \u2261Al<sup>3+</sup> initiated the generation of reactive radical species. This interaction led as well to the formation of surface adsorbed HO and few O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> on \u2261Cu<sup>2+</sup> Lewis acid sites. Besides, the interfacial redox reaction with ozone is favored by the presence of \u2261Cu<sup>2+</sup> following the sequence of \u2261Cu<sup>2+</sup>/\u2261Cu<sup>+</sup>/\u2261Cu<sup>2+</sup> redox cycle."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
