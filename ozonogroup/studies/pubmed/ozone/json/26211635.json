They cause a range of adverse health effects, acid rain, and are precursors to formation of other atmospheric pollutants, such as ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and inorganic aerosols. Photocatalytic materials containing a semi-conductor that can be activated by sunlight, such as titanium dioxide, have been studied for their ability to remove NOx. The study presented herein aims to elucidate the environmental parameters that most influence the NOx removal efficiency of photocatalytic coatings in hot and humid climate conditions. Concrete samples coated with a commercially available photocatalytic coating (a stucco) and an uncoated sample have been tested in a reactor simulating reasonable summertime outdoor sunlight, relative humidity and temperature conditions in southeast Texas. Two-level full factorial experiments were completed on each sample for five parameters. It was found that contact time, relative humidity and temperature significantly influenced both NO and NO\u2082removal. Elevated concentrations of organic pollutants reduced NO removal by the coating. Ultra-violet light intensity did not significantly influence removal of NO or NO\u2082, however, ultra-violet light intensity was involved in a two-factor interaction that significantly influenced removal of both NO and NO\u2082."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Zephyr Environmental Corporation , Austin , TX , USA."}], "LastName": "Cros", "ForeName": "Clement J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Terpeluk", "ForeName": "Alexandra L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Crain", "ForeName": "Neil E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Juenger", "ForeName": "Maria C G", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Corsi", "ForeName": "Richard L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AUG1H506LY", "NameOfSubstance": "propylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T75W9911L6", "NameOfSubstance": "Propane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Propane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26211635", "10.1080/10962247.2015.1040524"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
