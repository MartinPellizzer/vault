The percentage of adsorption capacities before and after regeneration were used to evaluate regeneration efficiency. The PVDF and PVDF-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fiber mats were prepared by electrospinning technique. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses directly confirmed that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were generally exposed to the surface of PVDF-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fiber mats. Among them, PVDF-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 10% fiber mats can effectively adsorb minocycline (remove efficiency >97% in 18\u202fh) with \ufb01rst-order rate constant k\u202f=\u202f2.253\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.331 h<sup>-1</sup>. The sorption capacity can still keep 81% after five sorption/UV-regeneration circulations. Two successional stages may exist during regeneration: (i) transfer of minocycline from the surface of PVDF-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fibers to the DI water, followed by the (ii) decomposition of this compound in aqueous solution by direct and indirect photolysis to yield the intermediate species. The desorption capacity and desorption percentage were 4.39\u202fmg\u202fg<sup>-1</sup> and 23.30% respectively. The regeneration yields were further enhanced to 94.20% by UV radiation. Minocycline was effectively degraded to intermediate products by direct and indirect photolysis, further degraded into CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and NO<sub>x</sub> by UV-generated ozone during regeneration. The results indicated that UV radiation was an effective method of regenerating PVDF-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fiber mats with low energy requirements. The photochemical byproducts and the reaction sites during regeneration were also determined and recognized."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
