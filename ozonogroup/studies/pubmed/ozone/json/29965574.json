The results showed as follows:reduction of Microcystis aeruginosa could reach 36% at the ozonation concentration of 28.92 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>. Humic acid-like compounds first increased and then decreased with continuing addition of ozone dosage, whereas soluble microbial products, fulvic acids and aromatic protein substance all diminished. Low dosage of ozone had certain effect on control of dichloroacetonitrile(DCAN) and trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN) formation potential, yet augmented the yield of trichloronitromethane (TCNM) and 1,1,1-trichloroacetone(1,1,1-TCP) precursors, and N-DBPs formation potential was promoted with the increase of ozone dosage. Algae removal efficiency was relatively the best under the acidic condition, meanwhile, UV<sub>254</sub> and DOC increased with the rise of pH, though the change was not outstanding. Humic acid-like compounds decreased with the rise of pH; ozonation could degrade the soluble microbial products and the consequence was affected little by the change of pH. DCAN and TCAN formation potential decreased with the rise of pH; TCNM formation potential appeared to be the highest when the pH was 10, whereas the highest 1,1,1-TCP formation potential was found at pH 7."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Ministry of Education, Faculty of Urban Construction and Environmental Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400045, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Sai", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Ministry of Education, Faculty of Urban Construction and Environmental Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400045, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xue-Bin", "Initials": "XB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Ministry of Education, Faculty of Urban Construction and Environmental Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400045, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Ministry of Education, Faculty of Urban Construction and Environmental Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400045, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Southwest Architectural Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd., Shandong Branch, Qingdao 266073, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xian-Qiang", "Initials": "XQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetonitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6397DL8869", "NameOfSubstance": "trichloroacetonitrile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I4JTX7Z7U2", "NameOfSubstance": "chloropicrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NW27ZG5LDA", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1,1-trichloroacetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O0L64V63M9", "NameOfSubstance": "dichloroacetonitrile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Acetonitriles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microcystis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965574", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201608080"]}}]}
