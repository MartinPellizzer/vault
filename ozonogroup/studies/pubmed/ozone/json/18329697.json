However, the class imbalance problem, i.e., in some collected field data, number of O(3) polluted days are much smaller than that of non-polluted days, will deteriorate the model performance on minority class-O(3) polluted days. Despite support vector machine (SVM) obtaining promising results in air quality prediction, in this study, a cost-sensitive classification scheme is proposed for the standard support vector classification model (S-SVC) in order to investigate whether the class imbalance plagues S-SVC. The S-SVC with such scheme is named as CS-SVC. Experiments on imbalanced data sets collected from two air quality monitoring sites in Hong Kong show that 1) S-SVC is still sensitive to class imbalance problem; 2) compared with S-SVC, CS-SVC effectively avoids class imbalance problem with lower percentage of false negative on O(3) polluted days but with higher percentage of false positive on non-polluted days; 3) compared with both S-SVC and CS-SVC, support vector regression model (SVR), after converting its output to binary one, only has similar performance with S-SVC, which indicates class imbalance problem also impairs the regressor model. From point of protecting public health, CS-SVC, which less likely misses to forecast O(3) polluted days, is recommended here."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building and Construction, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. bcwzlu@cityu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Wei-Zhen", "Initials": "WZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18329697", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.01.035", "S0048-9697(08)00077-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
