The results showed that:under the influence of the type A tropical cyclone, the risk of regional ozone concentration exceeding the standard exhibited little change. Under the influence of the type B tropical cyclone, the risk of ozone exceeding the standard in the PRD was obviously increased. Under the influence of the type C tropical cyclone, the risk of regional ozone exceeding the standard obviously increased, but the increase was weaker than that of the type B tropical cyclone. The type D tropical cyclone was far away from the Chinese mainland and had little influence on ozone concentration in the PRD. When the type A or type C tropical cyclones occurred, the average daily maximum 8-hour average ozone concentration (MDA8) in the PRD region increased by approximately 5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the ozone MDA8 in some cities may have decreased. When the type B tropical cyclone occurred, the regional ozone MDA8 increased by 19 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> on average, and the ozone concentration in all cities increased significantly. Among them, the average increase in ozone MDA8 in Zhuhai and Jiangmen was relatively large, with an increase of greater than 20 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Generally speaking, the ozone concentration in cities in the western PRD was more affected by tropical cyclones. When the type B tropical cyclone occurred, solar radiation increased, sunshine duration lengthened, cloud cover decreased, air temperature rose, and relative humidity decreased in the PRD, all of which were beneficial to photochemical reactions. Meanwhile, downward flow increased in the boundary layer, and downward flow transported high-concentration ozone to the ground, which promoted the increase in ozone concentration on the ground. When type A or type C tropical cyclones occurred, the change in meteorological conditions was not entirely conducive to the increase in ozone concentration, and in some cases, even adverse meteorological conditions such as rainfall occurred, which led to the risk of regional ozone exceeding the standard being less than that of the type B tropical cyclone. Affected by tropical cyclones, sunshine hours and air temperature in western cities of the PRD increased more than those in eastern cities, which was more conducive to ozone generation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Meteorological Centre, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Meng-Yao", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia-Ren", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510530, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lai-Guo", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Shao-Jia", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclonic Storms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35686765", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202109169"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
