Reactions with materials inside building envelopes are expected to influence the amount of ambient NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> that infiltrates indoors. However, envelope penetration factors for ambient NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> constituents have never been measured. Here, we develop and apply methods to measure the penetration factor and indoor loss rates for ambient NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> constituents using time-resolved measurements in an unoccupied apartment unit. Multiple test methods and parameter estimation approaches were tested, including natural and artificial indoor NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> elevation with and without accounting for indoor oxidation reactions. Twelve of 16 tests yielded successful estimates of penetration factors and indoor loss rates. The penetration factor for NO was confirmed to be \u223c1 and the mean (\u00b1s.d.) NO<sub>2</sub> penetration factor was 0.72 \u00b1 0.06 with a mean relative uncertainty of \u223c15%. The mean (\u00b1s.d.) indoor NO<sub>2</sub> loss rate was 0.27 \u00b1 0.12 h<sup>-1</sup>, ranging 0.06-0.47 h<sup>-1</sup>, with strong correlations with indoor relative and absolute humidity. Indoor NO loss rates were strongly correlated with the estimated ozone concentration in infiltrating air. Results suggest that envelope penetration factors and loss rates for NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> constituents can be reasonably estimated across a wide range of conditions using these approaches."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering , Illinois Institute of Technology , Alumni Memorial Hall 228E, 3201 South Dearborn Street , Chicago , Illinois 60616 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Haoran", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering , Portland State University , Portland , Oregon 97201 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1351-0547"], "LastName": "Gall", "ForeName": "Elliott T", "Initials": "ET"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering , Illinois Institute of Technology , Alumni Memorial Hall 228E, 3201 South Dearborn Street , Chicago , Illinois 60616 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0177-6703"], "LastName": "Stephens", "ForeName": "Brent", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31322867", "10.1021/acs.est.9b02920"]}}]}
