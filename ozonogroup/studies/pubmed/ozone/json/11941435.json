The samplers are DNPH-containing impingers, DNPH-impregnated cartridges and filters, and 2-HMP coated XAD-2 tubes. The three first DNPH samplers are to be analyzed by HPLC and the latter by GC-MS for the oxazolidine derivatives. The intermethod comparison comprises two to five sets of experiments depending on the compounds of interest. The aim of the exercise was also to assess the chemical interferences caused by ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and ammonia when using different techniques for sampling and analysis. The active DNPH method (with minor modifications such as shorter sampling time, immediate elution after sampling, and/or eventually wetting of samplers) delivered results within the 30% overall relative uncertainty for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein at the upper microg x m(-3) levels. However, the results suggest that the current DNPH methods for aldehydes do not comply with the 30% minimum performance criteria at the sub microg x m(-3) level. Sampling of aldehydes in the presence of ozone and NO2 interferences by using a \"scrubber\" cartridge appears to be beneficial to the quality of results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IST-Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, 19 Rue du Bugnon, 1005 Lausanne, Switzerland.
