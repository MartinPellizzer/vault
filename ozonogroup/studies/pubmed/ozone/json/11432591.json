This approach involves ozonation and then followed by graft polymerization with acrylates containing PEG, sulfonated PEG or by coupling of PEG derivatives. All the reactions were confirmed by ATR FT-IR and ESCA. The degree of ozonation measured by the iodide method was dependent on the ozone permeability of the polymers used. Surface hydrophilicity was investigated by measuring the contact angles. Ozonation itself yielded a slight increase in hydrophilicity and a decrease in platelet adhesion, but PEG immobilization showed a significant effect on surface hydrophilicity and platelet adhesion to confirm well-known PEG's passivity which minimize the adhesion of blood components on polymer surfaces. Both graft polymerization and coupling were effective for PU. In contrast, only grafting gave enough yields for PMMA and silicone. Platelet adhesion results demonstrated that all PEG modified surfaces adsorbed lower platelet adhesion than untreated or ozonated ones. Polymers coupled with sulfonated PEG exhibited the lowest platelet adhesion when compared with control and PEG coupled ones by virtue of the synergistic effect of non-adhesive PEG and negatively charged SO3 groups. This PEG or sulfonated PEG immobilization technology using ozonation is relatively simple for introducing uniform surface modification and therefore very useful for practical application of blood contacting medical devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomaterials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Cheongryang, Seoul, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "Y G", "Initials": "YG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "W K", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biomaterials", "NlmUniqueID": "8100316", "ISSNLinking": "0142-9612"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9011-14-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymethyl Methacrylate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Atomic Force"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymethyl Methacrylate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11432591", "10.1016/s0142-9612(00)00400-2", "S0142-9612(00)00400-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
