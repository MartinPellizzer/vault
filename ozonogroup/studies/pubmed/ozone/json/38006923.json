Wastewater effluents containing PhACs residues is discharged in municipal sewage and, subsequently collected in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) where are not entirely removed. Thus, PhACs and its transformation products (TPs) are discharged into water bodies. In the current work, the transformation of PhACs under treatments used in municipal WWTPs such as biological, photolysis, chlorination, and ozonation processes was reviewed. Data set of the major transformation pathways were obtained of studies that performed the PhACs removal and TPs monitoring during batch-scale experiments using gas and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC/LC-MS/MS). Several transformation pathways as dealkylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, acetylation, aromatic ring opening, chlorination, dehalogenation, photo-substitution, and ozone attack reactions were identified during the transformation of PhACs. Especially, hydroxylation reaction was identified as transformation pathway in all the processes. During the elucidation of hydroxylated TPs several isobaric compounds as monohydroxylated and dihydroxylated were identified. However, hydroxylated TPs monitoring in wastewater and aquatic environments is a topic scarcely studied due to that has no environmental significance, lack of available analytic standars of hydroxylated TPs and lack of analytic methods for their identification. Thus, screening strategy for environmental monitoring of hydroxylated TPs was proposed through target and suspect screening using GC/LC-MS/MS systems. In the next years, more studies on the hydroxylated TPs monitoring are necessary for its detection in WWTPs effluents as well as studies on their environmental effects in aquatic environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
