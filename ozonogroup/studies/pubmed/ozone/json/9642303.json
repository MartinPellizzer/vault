In the second period, the adult mice inhaled ozone or the splenic lymphocytes from adult mice were cultured in the medium containing peroxide hydrogen.

The three herbal decoctions all have reversing effects on each of these parameters except that the decoction of removing blood stasis has inhibitory effects on IL-1 and IL-2 production.
