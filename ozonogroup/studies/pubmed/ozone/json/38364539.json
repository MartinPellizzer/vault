However, FWD is difficult to dewatering. In this study, persulfate was synergistic oxidized by ozone to improve digestate dewaterability. The optimal conditions was at pH\u00a0=\u00a03, O<sub>3</sub>\uff1d40\u00a0mg/g TS and PDS\uff1d0.1\u00a0g/g TS, under which the reductions in the normalized capillary suction time (NCST) and bound moisture (BM) of the FWD were 89.97% and 65.79%, respectively. Hydrophilic functional groups (oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups) and hydrophilic protein molecular structures were decomposed by the reactive species of sulfate radical (SO<sub>4</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup>) and hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) generated in the ozone-persulfate oxidation process, disrupting the binding between EPS and water molecules. The contributions of SO<sub>4</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup> and \u00b7OH to digestate dewaterability were 42.51% and 28.55%. In addition, the introduction of H<sup>+</sup> reduced electrostatic repulsion and contributed to the condensation of digestate flocs. The environmental implication assessment and economic analysis suggested that the O<sub>3</sub>/PDS oxidation process was cost-effective and has a low environmental implication when applied to the FWD dewaterability improvement process. These results can serve as a reference for the management of FWD and further improvement of FWD treatment and disposal efficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
