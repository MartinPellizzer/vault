As a part of this study, temporal and spatial distributions of ambient ozone concentrations in the 20-county. Atlanta metropolitan area during the summers of 1993, 1994, and 1995 were assessed. A universal kriging procedure was used for spatial interpolation of aerometric monitoring station data. In this paper, the temporal and spatial distributions of ozone are described, and regulatory and epidemiologic implications are discussed. For the study period, the Atlanta ozone nonattainment area based on the 1-h, exceedance-based standard of 0.12 ppm is estimated to expand--from 56% of the Atlanta MSA by area and 71% by population to 88% by area and 96% by population--under the new 8-h, concentration-based standard of 0.08 ppm. Regarding asthma exacerbation, a 4% increase in pediatric asthma rate per 20-ppb increase in ambient ozone concentration was observed (p-value = 0.001), with ambient ozone level representing a general indicator of air quality due to its correlations with other pollutants. The use of spatial ozone estimates in the epidemiologic analysis demonstrates the need for control of demographic covariates in spatiotemporal assessments of associations of ambient air pollutant concentrations with health outcome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulholland", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Butler", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkinson", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tolbert", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Georgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9602552", "10.1080/10473289.1998.10463695"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
