By establishing the relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and air temperature near the surface, the mean background O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratios in the clean and polluted seasons were determined to be 35-40 and 50-55\u00a0ppbv in China during 2013-2019, respectively. Simulations using the chemical transport model (i.e., the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry model, WRF/Chem) suggested that biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions were the primary contributor to the increase in the background O<sub>3</sub> in the polluted season (BOP) compared to the background O<sub>3</sub> in the clean season (BOC), ranging from 8\u00a0ppbv to 16\u00a0ppbv. More importantly, the BOP continuously increased at a rate of 0.6-8.0\u00a0ppbv\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> during 2013-2019, while the non-BOP stopped increasing after 2017. Consequently, an additional 2%-16% reduction in anthropogenic VOC emissions is required to reverse the current O<sub>3</sub> back to that measured in the period from 2013 to 2017. The results of this study emphasize the importance of the relative contribution of the background O<sub>3</sub> to the observed total O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the design of anthropogenic precursor emission control strategies for the attainment of O<sub>3</sub> standards."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
