In this study, the net yield of cis-UCA was measured after the photoisomerization of urocanic acid by narrow UV wavebands (spectral range 295-405 nm), with the irradiation doses related to solar irradiance at sea level. The formation of cis-UCA in Caucasian skin (in vivo), as well as in aqueous solution (in vitro), was determined by HPLC analysis. The same irradiation conditions were met in both components of the study. The in vivo experiments showed high efficiency of cis-UCA formation in the spectral region of 305-341 nm, whereas high efficiency in vitro was found at 305 and 326 nm. At 350 and 363 nm, cis-UCA was formed in vivo, but not in vitro. At longer test wavelengths up to 405 nm, no significant formation of cis-UCA was detectable. The established partition between UVB and UVA at 320 nm is not relevant for the isomerization pattern of UCA. Additional studies revealed substantial cis-UCA formation in human skin by UVA phototherapy lamps. Furthermore, raised levels of 295 nm irradiation doses, a possible effect of stratospheric ozone depletion, were found to increase the cis-UCA yield. Our results demonstrate that the formation of cis-UCA in the skin with common exposures takes place over a broad spectrum range of UVB and UVA, up to at least 363 nm. These findings emphasize the potency of UVA to isomerize UCA, and they may contribute to further elucidation of the effects of phototherapy and sunbathing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kammeyer", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teunissen", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pavel", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Rie", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bos", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0004041", "ISSNLinking": "0007-0963"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "G8D26XJJ3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Urocanic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phototherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urocanic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "White People"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7662566", "10.1111/j.1365-2133.1995.tb16943.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
