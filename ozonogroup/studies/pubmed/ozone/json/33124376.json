To determine the content and species of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in industrial organic solvents and to provide the emission factors of organic solvents, the Chinese wood and automotive coatings, which accounted for the largest proportion of production in the world, were investigated. Coating samples were obtained by sampling from companies and buying from markets, and were measured in accordance with the domestic standard testing methods for coatings. The content and composition spectrum of VOCs in the coatings were determined, and the ozone formation potential (OFP) was then calculated. The results showed that for wood coatings, the average content of the VOCs in solvent-based, water-based, and ultra-violet (UV) coatings were 37.28%, 9.88%, and 18.02%, respectively. For automotive coatings, the average content of the VOCs in water-based original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coating, solvent-based OEM coating, water-based refinishing coating, and solvent-based refinishing coating were 15.06%, 59.90%, 11.79%, and 54.50%, respectively. The content of the VOCs in different types of coatings varied substantially. The main components and OFP contributors were alcohols and ethers for water-based coatings, benzene series and esters for solvent-based coatings, and esters, alcohols, and ethers for UV coatings. The average value of the coating samples could meet the current mandatory national standards, but 12% of the solvent-based wood coating samples and 42% of the solvent-based OEM coating samples did not meet the standards. In addition, except for the benzene series of the water-based wood coatings, the contents of harmful substances in other coating samples were up to the standards."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Yun-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yu-Hang", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Hai-Rong", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui-Yuan", "Initials": "RY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for VOCs Pollution Control Technology and Equipment(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hao-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for VOCs Pollution Control Technology and Equipment(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Li-Ya", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for VOCs Pollution Control Technology and Equipment(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal(SCUT), Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Dai-Qi", "Initials": "DQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33124376", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202002103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
