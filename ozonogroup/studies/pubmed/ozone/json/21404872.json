One bin was treated with ozone and the second bin served as a control. Stored grain insects were placed in bins for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-d exposure periods in sampling tubes to test ozone concentrations of 0, 25, 50, and 70 parts per million by volume (ppmv). Ozone treatments on eggs and larvae of Plodia interpunctella (H\u00fcbner) were not effective, but pupae were more susceptible. Sitophilus oryzae (L.) adults were the most susceptible species with 100% mortality reached after 2 d in all ozone treatments. However, some progeny were produced at all concentrations and exposure periods. Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) adults had 100% mortality only after 4 d at 50 or 70 ppmv. No T. castaneum progeny were produced after 2-4 d at 70 ppmv. For Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), 100% mortality was never achieved and progeny were produced at all ozone concentrations. Laboratory experiments, testing the effectiveness of ozone in controlling psocids, were conducted in two polyvinyl chloride cylinders each containing 55 kg of hard red winter wheat. Ozone treatment at a concentration of 70 ppmv was highly effective against adult female Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel and Liposcelis paeta Pearman after only 1 d of exposure. However, it was not effective against eggs of both species at all exposure periods. Ozonation has potential for the control of some stored grain insect pests on wheat."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, Oklahoma State University, 127 Noble Research Center, Stillwater, OK 74078-3033, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bonjour", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Opit", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hardin", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Payton", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beeby", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Econ Entomol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985127R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0493"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Parasitology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oklahoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21404872", "10.1603/ec10200"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
