Both factors had isoelectric points of 6.45-6.75, but differed by molecular mass. The pneumocyte factor had an estimated weight of 38 +/- 3 kDa, while the fibroblast factor had an estimated molecular weight of 32 +/- 2 kDa. To determine whether the appearance of these factors in plasma is specific for ozone injury or whether they appear in response to other oxidant injuries, adult rats were exposed to 85% O2 or air for up to 2 weeks. Animals were sacrificed at 3, 5, 7, or 14 days after the onset of exposure. Plasma samples were subjected to sequential preparative electrofocusing and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Heat-inactivated plasma fractions, with an isoelectric point of 6.45-6.75, contained a factor of 32 +/- 2 kDa, which enhanced lung fibroblast DNA synthesis at a single time point on day 5 of 85% O2 exposure, and a factor of 38 +/- 3 kDa, which enhanced pneumocyte DNA synthesis on days 5, 7, and 14 of 85% O2 exposure. Of the known growth factors, those most likely to have these physical characteristics are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1. Additional groups of animals were exposed to air or 85% O2 for 5 days for plasma collection. Animals exposed to 85% O2 had a 60% increase of plasma immunoreactive PDGF and a 90% increase of plasma immunoreactive IGF-1, compared with values for control animals exposed to air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanswell", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buch", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fraher", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67763-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoradiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Focusing"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1959501", "10.3109/01902149109064323"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
