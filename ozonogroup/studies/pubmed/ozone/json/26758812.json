The application of a gas-phase pulsed corona discharge (PCD) was investigated to remove CBZ from synthetic solutions and spiked wastewater effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. The treated water was showered between high voltage (HV) wires and grounded plate electrodes, to which ultra-short HV pulses were applied. CBZ was readily oxidized and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydroquinazoline-2-one (BQM) and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD) were identified as the most abundant primary transformation products, which, contrary to CBZ ozonation data available in the literature, were further easily oxidized with PCD: BQM and BQD attributed to only a minor portion of the target compound oxidized. In concentrations commonly found in wastewater treatment plant effluents (around 5\u2005\u00b5g\u2005L(-1)), up to 97% reduction in CBZ concentration was achieved at mere 0.3\u2005kW\u2005h\u2005m(-3) energy consumption, and over 99.9% was removed at 1\u2005kW\u2005h\u2005m(-3). The PCD application proved to be efficient in the removal of both the parent substance and its known transformation products, even with the competing reactions in the complex composition of wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Thermal Unit Operations/Separation Technology , School of Engineering Science, Lappeenranta University of Technology , Lappeenranta , Finland."}], "LastName": "Ajo", "ForeName": "Petri", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory of Organic Chemistry , \u00c5bo Akademi University , Turku , Finland."}], "LastName": "Krzymyk", "ForeName": "Ewelina", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c School of Environment and Energy , South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center , Panyu District, Guangzhou , Guangdong Province , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Preis", "ForeName": "Sergei", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Institute of Non-Destructive Testing, Tomsk Polytechnic University , Tomsk , Russia."}], "LastName": "Kornev", "ForeName": "Iakov", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory of Organic Chemistry , \u00c5bo Akademi University , Turku , Finland."}], "LastName": "Kronberg", "ForeName": "Leif", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Thermal Unit Operations/Separation Technology , School of Engineering Science, Lappeenranta University of Technology , Lappeenranta , Finland."}], "LastName": "Louhi-Kultanen", "ForeName": "Marjatta", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33CM23913M", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamazepine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carbamazepine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26758812", "10.1080/09593330.2016.1141236"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
