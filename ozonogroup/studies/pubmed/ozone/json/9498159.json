Given that these stressors induce heat shock protein (Hsp) expression and that heat shock protein reactivity is implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular disease, this study assessed the effect of VasoCare on intracellular expression of Hsp60 and Hsp70 by treated peripheral blood leukocytes. Contrary to expectations, VasoCare induced a significant reduction (approximately 40%) in the proportion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing intracellular Hsp60 and Hsp70, whereas it had no effect on heat shock protein expression by peripheral blood neutrophils. Cell surface heat shock protein expression was not detectable. The reduced expression of Hsp60 by mononuclear cells was concomitant with an increase in the levels of Hsp60 in treated plasma. Although the mechanism underlying the clinical effectiveness of VasoCare therapy has yet to be established, it may be that re-administration of treated blood or soluble factors derived therefrom modifies in vivo immune responsiveness to heat shock proteins or associated molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Sciences Centre, University of Sheffield, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bulmer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bolton", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pockley", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9498159"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
