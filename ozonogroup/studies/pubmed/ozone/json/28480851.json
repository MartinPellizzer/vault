In total, 124 patients were enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups according the treatment methods. Study group consisted of 53 patients, who received intravenously ozonized saline in addition to conservative treatment. The control group consisted of 71 patients who received only conventional therapy. The study period was 6-15 days. The results showed that the use of ozone therapy is not accompanied by negative injury responses at the level of hemostasis parameters and blood biochemical characteristics. Furthermore, ozone therapy may have a favorable effect on treatment outcome in patients with purulent-inflammatory complications and daibetes mellitus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine \"Bukovinian State Medical University:, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karatieieva", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine \"Bukovinian State Medical University:, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plesh", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine \"Bukovinian State Medical University:, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yurkiv", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine \"Bukovinian State Medical University:, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Semenenko", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine \"Bukovinian State Medical University:, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kozlovskaya", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Georgia (Republic)", "MedlineTA": "Georgian Med News", "NlmUniqueID": "101218222", "ISSNLinking": "1512-0112"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Abscess"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "surgery", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Carbonylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Soft Tissue Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Wound Infection"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28480851"]}}]}
