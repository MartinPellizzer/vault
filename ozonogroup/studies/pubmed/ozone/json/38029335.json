The different parallel pathways in aromatic oxidation, however, remain inadequately understood. Here, we investigated the production yields and chemical distributions of gas-phase tracer products during the photooxidation of alkylbenzenes at atmospheric OH levels with NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> present using high-resolution mass spectrometers. The peroxide-bicyclic intermediate pathway emerged as the major pathway in aromatic oxidation, accounting for 52.1 \u00b1 12.6%, 66.1 \u00b1 16.6%, and 81.4 \u00b1 24.3% of the total OH oxidation of toluene, m-xylene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, respectively. Notably, the yields of bicyclic nitrates produced from the reactions of bicyclic peroxy radicals (BPRs) with NO were considerably lower (3-5 times) than what the current mechanism predicted. Alongside traditional ring-opening products formed through the bicyclic pathway (dicarbonyls and furanones), we identified a significant proportion of carbonyl olefinic acids generated via the 1,5-aldehydic H-shift occurring in subsequent reactions of BPRs + NO, contributing 4-7% of the carbon flow in aromatic oxidation. Moreover, the observed NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-dependencies of ring-opening and ring-retaining product yields provide insights into the competitive nature of reactions involving BPRs with NO, HO<sub>2</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub>, which determine the refined product distributions and offer an explanation for the discrepancies between the experimental and model-based results."]}, "AuthorList":
