In this study, a combined catalytic microbubble ozonation and biological process was developed and applied for efficient industrial phenolic wastewater (PWW) treatment. Catalytic activity of an iron-oxides (FeO<sub>x</sub>) doped granular activated carbon (GAC) catalyst (FeO<sub>x</sub>@GAC) in microbubble ozonation for PWW treatment was investigated. The results demonstrated that the FeO<sub>x</sub>@GAC catalyzed microbubble ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>/FeO<sub>x</sub>@GAC) obtained significantly higher reaction rate constant (k<sub>1</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.023 min<sup>-1</sup>) in TOC removal compared to the bare GAC catalyzed microbubble ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>/GAC, k<sub>1</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.013 min<sup>-1</sup>) and ordinary microbubble ozonation (k<sub>1</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.008 min<sup>-1</sup>). Destruction rate constant of phenolic compounds (k<sub>2</sub>) was improved from 0.014 min<sup>-1</sup> (ordinary microbubble ozonation) to 0.025 min<sup>-1</sup> (O<sub>3</sub>/FeO<sub>x</sub>@GAC). The 60-min pretreatment of PWW by O<sub>3</sub>/FeO<sub>x</sub>@GAC process enhanced BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD ratio from 0.31 to 0.76 and reduced the acute bio-toxicity by 79.2%. Screening and characterization of biological post-treatment processes were conducted among activated sludge process (ASP), up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and membrane bioreactor (MBR). UASB and ASP showed limited phenolic compounds removal of 35.4% and 57.0% with lower bio-toxicity resistance than MBR (94.9% phenolic compounds removal). The combined process O<sub>3</sub>/FeO<sub>x</sub>@GAC-MBR was thus developed and achieved high COD removal (98.0%) and phenolic compounds degradation (99.4%). PWW pretreatment by O<sub>3</sub>/FeO<sub>x</sub>@GAC process decreased membrane fouling rate of MBR by 88.2% by reducing proteins/polysaccharides accumulation in both extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing revealed the predominance of phylum Proteobacteria, class Alphaproteobacteria and genera Mycobacterium, Gordonia, Pedomicrobium & Defluviimonas in biological PWW treatment bio-systems. Pearson correlation coefficient and ANOVA analysis verified that Mycobacterium possessed high bio-toxicity resistance and was the main contributor to the biodegradation of phenolic compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
