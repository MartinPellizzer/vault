Asthmatic (n = 49), wheezy (n = 53), and healthy (n = 93) children completed a four-day (Friday through Monday) study protocol, once in spring and again in summer, that included the use of daily activity and symptom diaries, heart rate recording devices, personal O3 samplers, and maximal effort spirometry several times per day. Data from regional monitoring stations were used to establish ambient hourly O3 concentrations. Analyses revealed that the children spent more time outdoors and were more physically active in the spring. Girls spent less time outdoors and were less physically active than boys. Personal O3 samplers correlated poorly with, and generally gave lower readings than, outdoor ambient monitors. Higher personal O3 exposures were associated generally with increased inhaler use, more outdoor time, and more physical activity. Children with asthma spent more time outdoors and were more active in the spring on high-O3 days (measured by personal sampler), and had the most trouble breathing, the most wheezing, and the most inhaler use on these days. Activity pattern data suggested that children with asthma protected themselves by being less physically active outdoors during the summer on high-O3 days. Wheezy children had the most trouble breathing during the summer on low-O3 days (measured by personal sampler). Observed relationships between O3 and pulmonary function were erratic and difficult to reconcile with existing knowledge about the acute respiratory effects of air pollution. We conclude that although asthmatic and wheezy children behave differently from their healthy peers with regard to symptoms and patterns of activity when challenged by ambient ozone, the nature of these changes remains inconsistent and ill-defined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Southern California, Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avol", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Navidi", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rappaport", "ForeName": "E B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peters", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Res Rep Health Eff Inst", "NlmUniqueID": "8812230", "ISSNLinking": "1041-5505"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Sounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9635336"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
