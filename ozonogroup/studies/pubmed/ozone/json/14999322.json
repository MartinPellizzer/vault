A GC-helium ionisation detector (HID) system measured 15 C(2)-C(5) hydrocarbons with 5 min time resolution and a dual channel GC-Electron Capture Detector (ECD) measured PAN with 90 s resolution. Both instruments had low parts per trillion by volume (pptV) detection limits and ran continuously at the remote Jungfraujoch (JFJ) research station in the Swiss Alps (46.55[degree]N, 7.98[degree]E), 3580 m above mean sea level (AMSL), during February/March 2003. Carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide and all odd nitrogen species (NO(y)) were also measured continuously. Hydrocarbons and CO were strongly correlated in all air-masses whilst PAN exhibited both positive and negative correlations with respect to O(3), dependent on age and origin of the air-mass sampled. PAN was found to contribute [similar]20% to the NO(y) sampled on average. The experiment, as well as providing interesting datasets from this remote location, also demonstrated that when optimised, GC techniques have the potential to measure at a time resolution significantly greater than is traditionally considered, with high sensitivity and low uncertainty."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whalley", "ForeName": "L K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lewis", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McQuaid", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Purvis", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stemmler", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zellweger", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ridgeon", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I6KPI2E1HD", "NameOfSubstance": "Peracetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SQ8V0P4N89", "NameOfSubstance": "peroxyacetyl nitrate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Automation"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peracetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14999322", "10.1039/b310022g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
