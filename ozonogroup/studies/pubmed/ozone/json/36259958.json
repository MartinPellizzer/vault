Here, an innovative \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub>/ZSM-5 catalyst modified with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was successfully prepared, and both characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> introduction facilitated the formation of oxygen vacancies, Lewis and Br\u00f6nsted acid sites, and active oxygen species and enhanced the adsorption ability of toluene on \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub>/ZSM-5. Characterizations also showed that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> introduction made the catalyst possess larger specific surface area, superior reducibility, and stronger surface acidity. As a result, \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub>/ZSM-5 with a S/Mn molar ratio of 0.019 exhibited the best toluene conversion and CO<sub><i>x</i></sub> selectivity, 87 and 94%, respectively, after the reaction for 8 h at 30 \u00b0C under an initial concentration of 5 ppm toluene and 45 ppm ozone, relative humidity of 45%, and space velocity of 32,000 h<sup>-1</sup>, far superior to those of non-noble catalysts reported to date under comparable reaction conditions. The synergistic role of increased oxygen vacancies and acid sites of \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub>/ZSM-5 modified with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> resulted in excellent toluene conversion and CO<sub><i>x</i></sub> selectivity. The findings represented a critical step toward the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient catalysts for catalytic ozonation of toluene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9881-9687"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing100191, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing100191, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3834-8929"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing100191, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tianle", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5611-3093"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing100191, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Haining", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5234-3775"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing100191, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4166-4615"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing100191, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Fangxia", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8754-5083"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing100191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36259958", "10.1021/acs.est.2c05174"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
