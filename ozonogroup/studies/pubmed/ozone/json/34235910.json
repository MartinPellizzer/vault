The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo effectiveness of chemical and physicochemical methods and their combinations against common oral Candida species on denture base acrylic resin.", "Patients were divided into six groups according to disinfection methods. For chemical disinfection, chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite, and glutaraldehyde were used by the patients. Microwave and ozone therapy were applied by physicians for physicochemical disinfection. Fungal load count was performed. This procedure was repeated before applying any disinfection procedures, at 1 week and 1 month after the patient started to use the relevant chemical disinfectant and apply physicochemical methods. A multivariate analysis test was used to determine the change in fungal load over time and whether this change led to a difference among the groups (P < .05).", "The most frequently isolated Candida strain was Candida albicans. The change in fungal load over time was significantly different (P < .001). However, the difference between the groups did not show any significant difference in the paired comparison analyses of the chemical disinfection groups (P >.05). No Candida strains were detected in either physicochemical method at any of the control time points.", "The study concluded that chemical disinfectants used by patients were effective for but total eradication of Candida adhesion requires the use of additional ozone or microwave therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Unalan Degirmenci", "ForeName": "Beyza", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayas Kakai", "ForeName": "Ribaz Tahsin", "Initials": "RT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guducuoglu", "ForeName": "H\u00fcseyin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ozcan", "ForeName": "Mutlu", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Quintessence Int", "NlmUniqueID": "0342677", "ISSNLinking": "0033-6572"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denture Bases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denture, Complete"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stomatitis, Denture"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "57"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34235910", "10.3290/j.qi.b1702307", "1702307"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
