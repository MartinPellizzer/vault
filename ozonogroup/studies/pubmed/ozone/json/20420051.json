The Ministry of Health, Malaysia, has been vigorously pursuing the environmental health agenda by collaborating with other agencies at district, state, national, and international levels. This article discusses the issues and management framework of environmental health in Malaysia. Some issues requiring further investigation in order to clearly understand the trade-off between atmospheric change and environmental health are suggested. These suggestions are developed with particular reference to appraisals concerned with the development and implementation of environmental policy, programs, and practice. Research on the relevant issues is discussed and a framework is built involving a comprehensive review of the literature and existing framework of Malaysian environmental health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Economics, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Faculty of Management and Economics, Malaysia, Terengganu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mokhtar", "ForeName": "Mazlin Bin", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murad", "ForeName": "Wahid", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0405525", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0892"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hazardous Waste"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hazardous Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20420051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
