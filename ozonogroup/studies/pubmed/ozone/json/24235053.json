In this study, an empirical model is used to explain the interdependence of ozone and grosswetterlagen. Different meteorological parameters such as air temperature, global solar radiation, relative humidity, wind direction and wind speed are used. Additional nitric oxide (NO) was taken as a representative for the emission situation and ozone maximum of the preceding day in order to evaluate the development of the photochemical situation. The dataset includes data collected over a period of three years (1992-1994) from three stations outside of Munich and one in the center of Munich.All values become variables by calculating means, sums or maxima of the basic dataset consisting of half-hour means. Seasonal periodicity of data is detected with Fourier analysis and eliminated by a division method after computing a seasonal index.The dataset is divided into three different grosswetterlagen groups, depending on main wind direction. One mostly cyclonic (westerly winds), onemixed (alternating winds) and one onlyanticyclonic (easterly winds). The last is completed with one summertime group including values from April to August.Factor analysis is performed for each group to obtain independent linear variable combinations. Overall, relative humidity is the dominant parameter, a typical value indicating meteorological conditions during a grosswetterlage.Linear multiple regression analysis is performed using the factors obtained to reveal how the ozone concentrations are explained in terms of meteorological parameters and NO. The results improve from cyclonic to anticyclonic grosswetterlagen in conformance with the increasing significance of photochemistry, indicated by the high solar radiation and high temperature, and the low relative humidity and low wind speed. The explained variance r(2) reaches its maximum with more than 50 % of the time in Munich center.This empirical model is applicable to the forecasting of local ozone maximum concentrations with a total standard error deviation of 8.5 to 12.8 % and, if ozone concentrations exceed 80 ppb, with a standard error deviation of 5.4 to 9.5 %."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Bioklimatologie und Immissionsforschung, Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Hohenbachstr. 22, D-85354, Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spichtinger", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winterhalter", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabian", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24235053", "10.1007/BF02985522"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
