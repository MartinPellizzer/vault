MB alternatives are needed due to the chemical's ability to damage the earth's ozone layer. Vacuum steam (VS) is an environmentally friendly method that was evaluated for its ability to eradicate B. fagacearum in logs (24 to 61 cm diameter; 1.7 to 1.9 m long) obtained from Q. rubra that had wilted following natural infection (NI) or artificial inoculation (AI). Five replicate loads of two NI and one AI logs were VS-treated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and 60\u00b0C for 60 min (at 5.0 cm sapwood depth). Mean frequencies of pretreatment fungus colonization ranged from 12.5 to 24.4% in NI and 29.4 to 45.6% in AI logs based on isolation from wood chips of inner and outer sapwood, respectively, of two disks per log. Frequencies of pathogen DNA detection were similar to those for isolation. No viable pathogen or its DNA were detected in posttreatment logs. Treatment times ranged from 5 to 9 h for the 56\u00b0C/30 min schedule and from 8 to 10 h for the 60\u00b0C/60 min schedule. Based on these results, VS is worthy of further development as a MB alternative."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, St. Paul, MN."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0577-7807"], "LastName": "Juzwik", "ForeName": "Jennifer", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Resources, University of Minnesota, St. Paul."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sustainable Biomaterials, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhangjing", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sustainable Biomaterials, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "Marshall S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Otis Laboratory, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Buzzards Bay, MA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shugrue", "ForeName": "Sarah", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Otis Laboratory, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Buzzards Bay, MA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mack", "ForeName": "Ronald", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steam"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Steam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30540535", "10.1094/PDIS-07-18-1252-RE"]}}]}
