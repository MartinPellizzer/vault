In order to explore the causes and sources of O<sub>3</sub> pollution, IPR process analysis and ISAM source tracking tools based on the CMAQ model were used, respectively, to quantify the contributions of different physicochemical processes and different source tracking areas to O<sub>3</sub> in Rizhao. Additionally, by comparing the differences between O<sub>3</sub>-exceeding days and non-exceeding days, combined with the HYSPLIT model, the regional transportation path of O<sub>3</sub> in Rizhao was explored. The results showed that the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, and VOCs near the coastal areas of Rizhao and Lianyungang were significantly increased on O<sub>3</sub> exceedance days compared with those on non-exceedance days. This was mainly because Rizhao was the convergence zone of western, southwestern, and eastern winds on exceedance days, which facilitated the transport and accumulation of pollutants. Process analysis showed that the transport process (TRAN) contribution to the near-surface O<sub>3</sub> near the coastal areas of Rizhao and Lianyungang increased significantly on the exceedance days, whereas the contribution to most areas to the west of Linyi decreased. Photochemical reaction (CHEM) had a positive contribution to the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Rizhao during the daytime at all heights, and TRAN had a positive contribution at 0-60 m above the ground, and mainly had a negative contribution above 60 m. The contributions of CHEM and TRAN at 0-60 m above the ground would increase significantly on exceedance days, which was approximately twice that on the non-exceedance days. Source analysis showed that the local sources in Rizhao were the main contribution sources of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs, with the contribution rates of 47.5% and 58.0%, respectively. O<sub>3</sub> mainly came from the contribution outside the simulation area (67.5%). The O<sub>3</sub> and precursor contributions of the western cities of Rizhao (Weifang, Linyi, etc.) and the southern cities (Lianyungang, etc.) would increase significantly on the days of exceeding the standard. The transportation path analysis showed that the number of exceedances accounted for the largest proportion (11.8%) in the path from the west of Rizhao, which was the main transportation channel of O<sub>3</sub> and precursors in Rizhao. This was verified through process analysis and source tracking results, and such trajectories accounted for 13.0% of the total number of trajectories, and their main routes were in the Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong regions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Ji-Long", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi-Fan", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu-Xiang", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong-le", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Ao", "ForeName": "Cong-Jie", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hao-Tian", "Initials": "HT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37309929", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202207223"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
