According to their apparent molecular weight (AMW), EfOM fractions were assigned to biopolymers (>20\u202fkDa), humic substances that comprise sub-fractions of humic-like acids (HA-I & HA-II, 2.3-7.0\u202fkDa) and fulvic-like acids (FA, 1.5-2.3\u202fkDa), building blocks (0.55-1.5\u202fkDa) and low molecular weight neutral substances (<550\u202fDa). The fractions of biopolymers and low molecular weight neutral substances didn't show humic-like fluorescence, while the fractions of HA-II, FA and building blocks usually had signatures of both humic-like and protein-like fluorescence. Humic substances generally contributed the largest proportion of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC & DON) in effluents. Coagulation removed EfOM fractions following the order of biopolymers\u202f>\u202fHA subfraction\u202f>\u202fFA subfraction\u202f>\u202fbuilding blocks, while little removal of protein-like fluorescence in HA-II and FA subfractions was detected. Anion exchange treatment could effectively reduce DOC and DON concentrations; the sequence of the treatment efficiency was humic substances\u202f>\u202fbiopolymers\u202f>\u202fbuilding blocks. Increasing O<sub>3</sub> doses caused DOC and DON of EfOM to be gradually transformed from large AMW fractions into small AMW fractions, while chromophores and fluorophores in HA subfractions were relatively more refractory than those in the other fractions. Size exclusion chromatography with multiple detectors are suggested to be an informative technique for estimating treatability of EfOM by advanced wastewater treatment processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
