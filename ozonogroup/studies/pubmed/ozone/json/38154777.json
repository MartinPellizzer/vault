Given the shifted ozone chemical regimes and recently boosted extreme weather in China, it's essential to rethink the O<sub>3</sub> trends since 2013 for evaluations of air pollution mitigation policy. Here, we examine the anthropogenically and meteorologically modulated summertime O<sub>3</sub> trends across China at different stages of the clean air actions using multi-source observations combined with multi-model calculations. Ozone increases steadily in China between 2013-2022, with a fast increase rate of 4.4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> in Phase I and a much smaller 0.6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> in Phase II of Action Plan. Results highlight that the deteriorative O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Phase I and early Phase II is dominated by the nonlinear O<sub>3</sub>-emission response. Persistent decline in O<sub>3</sub> precursors has shifted its chemical regime in urban areas and began to show a positive influence on ozone mitigation in recent years. Meteorological influence on O<sub>3</sub> variations is minor until 2019 (\u223c10%), but it greatly accelerates or relieves the O<sub>3</sub> pollution after then, showing comparable contribution to emissions. Epidemiological model predicts totally 0.8-3.0 thousand yr<sup>-1</sup> more deaths across China with altered anthropogenic emissions since clean air actions, and additional health burdens by -1.5-0.3 thousand yr<sup>-1</sup> from perturbated meteorology. This study calls for stringent emission control and climate adaptation strategies to attain the ozone pollution mitigation in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
