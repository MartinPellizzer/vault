We have analyzed the causes of cosine response and calibration errors carefully to define the corresponding correction terms, paying particular attention to those that are due to the spectral displacements of the filter transmittance peaks from the integer wavelength values. The influence of the ozone profile on the retrieved ozone at large solar zenith angles has also been examined by means of field measurements. The opportunity of carrying out nearly monochromatic irradiance measurements offered by the UV-RAD allowed us to improve the procedure usually followed to reconstruct the solar spectrum at the surface by fitting the computed results, using radiative transfer models with field measurements of irradiance. Two long-term comparison campaigns took place, showing that a mean discrepancy of +0.3% exists between the UV-RAD total ozone values and those given by the Brewer #63 spectroradiometer and that mean differences of +0.3% and -0.9% exist between the erythemal dose rates determined with the UV-RAD and those obtained with the Brewer #63 and the Brewer #104 spectroradiometers, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, Italian National Research Council, Bologna, Italy. b.petkov@isac.cnr.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petkov", "ForeName": "Boyan", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vitale", "ForeName": "Vito", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tomasi", "ForeName": "Claudio", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bonaf\u00e9", "ForeName": "Ubaldo", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scaglione", "ForeName": "Salvatore", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flori", "ForeName": "Daniele", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santaguida", "ForeName": "Riccardo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gausa", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "Georg", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colombo", "ForeName": "Tiziano", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16778947", "10.1364/ao.45.004383", "90212"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
