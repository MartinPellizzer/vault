However, evidence on health effects of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX in short) is insufficient.", "The present study aimed to assess the exposure-lag-response relations of ambient BTEX components with cardiorespiratory mortality in Hong Kong population.", "Daily BTEX concentrations from April 2011 to December 2014 were collected from the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department. Cause-specific mortality records were obtained from the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong. Generalized additive model (GAM) integrated with a distributed lag model (DLM) was used to estimate the excess risks of cardiorespiratory mortality associated with the cumulative exposure to benzene and TEX (toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene combined) over 0-9 lag days, while adjusting for time trend, seasonality, weather conditions and calendar effects.", "We observed the delayed and distributed lag effects of BTEX components on circulatory mortality. The cumulative exposures over 0-9 lag days for IQR increments of benzene (1.4\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and TEX (7.9\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) were associated with 5.8% (95%CI: 1.0% to 10.8%) and 3.5% (95%CI: 1.0% to 6.1%) increases in circulatory mortality, respectively. The effect estimates of benzene and TEX were more delayed than that of PM<sub>2.5</sub>.
