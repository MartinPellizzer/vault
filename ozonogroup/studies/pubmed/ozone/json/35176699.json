Moreover, the dynamic leachate characteristics pose a challenge for effective process control. Therefore, a combined treatment, consisting of a one-stage partial nitrification-Anammox process, an O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, and a granular activated carbon filtration (GAC) process, was investigated. Meanwhile, a novel surrogate-based ozone dose control strategy for O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process was evaluated. Results show that this three-stage process offers high removal of total nitrogen (> 90%), COD (chemical oxygen demand, 60-82%), and micropollutants (atrazine, alachlor, carbamazepine, and bisphenol A, > 96%), satisfying discharge requirements. In the combined post-treatment, ozone dosing for COD removal can be real-time controlled by UVA<sub>254</sub> reduction monitoring, based on a specific correlation between COD and UVA<sub>254</sub> changes. On the other hand, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> pre-treatment controlled at a 50% UVA<sub>254</sub> reduction shows to be the optimal point, when adsorption is designed as the main step for COD removal. Cost analysis shows that post-treatment with low (high) organic load i.e., COD \u2264\u00a0(\u2265)540\u00a0mg/L, a combination with O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (GAC) as the main step appears to be more cost-effective. Therefore, a dynamic operation strategy in response to the leachate change is recommended."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
