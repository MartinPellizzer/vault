Compared with other control processes, the combined process demonstrated a remarkable synergy, and it could obtain 90.5% of NB removal within 20\u00a0min. As for the mineralization experiment, the TOC removal efficiency for NB within 120\u00a0min was higher in the E-Fe<sup>0</sup>-O<sub>3</sub> process, while the energy consumption was lower than the traditional E-O<sub>3</sub> and E-Fe<sup>0</sup> process. Interestingly, hydroxyl radicals (OH) acted as a key role for NB removal, and the concentration of OH in different processes were compared. Further study indicated OH, direct anode oxidation, direct ozonation, and zero valence iron catalysis were all responsible for nitrobenzene removal. Besides, the durability of Fe<sup>0</sup> in the E-Fe<sup>0</sup>-O<sub>3</sub> process was systematically evaluated by reusing Fe<sup>0</sup> 10 times. Notably, the electric field could protect micro-size zero valence iron from passivation for catalytic ozonation after the long-term reaction. Finally, other ozone-refractory organics pollutants were also investigated in the E-Fe<sup>0</sup>-O<sub>3</sub> process, and the influence of various water matrices on NB removal was discussed. All results demonstrated that the E-Fe<sup>0</sup>-O<sub>3</sub> process was an efficient method to remove refractory organic pollutants in various natural waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
