Herein, a triphase catalytic system was constructed by aerating ozone through a CeO<sub>2</sub> loaded Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic membrane (CeO<sub>2</sub>-CM) for disinfection and antibiotic degradation. Ozone aeration and a packed catalyst system (CeO<sub>2</sub>-Packing) were set as the controls. Results showed that CeO<sub>2</sub>-CM reduced the ozone escape by 34.6%-56.2%. The ozone utilization capacity of CeO<sub>2</sub>-CM for E. coli inactivation was 33.1% and 33.8% higher than those of CeO<sub>2</sub>-Packing and ozone aeration, respectively. The ozone utilization capacity of CeO<sub>2</sub>-CM for sulfamethoxazole degradation was 88.5% and 183.1% higher than those of CeO<sub>2</sub>-Packing and ozone aeration, respectively. CeO<sub>2</sub>-CM, with the lowest ozone escape and highest ozone utilization efficiency, significantly enhanced the performance of catalytic ozonation in disinfection and antibiotic degradation. This work proposes a feasible strategy for minimizing ozone consumption in water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
