The objective of this study was to investigate whether maternal exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and ozone (O3 ) during pregnancy is associated with birth defects among women living throughout North Carolina.", "Information on maternal and infant characteristics was obtained from North Carolina birth certificates and health service data (2003-2005) and linked with information on birth defects from the North Carolina Birth Defects Monitoring Program. The 24-hr PM2.5 and O3 concentrations were estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian model of air pollution generated by combining modeled air pollution predictions from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Community Multi-Scale Air Quality model with air monitor data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System. Maternal residence was geocoded and assigned pollutant concentrations averaged over weeks 3 to 8 of gestation. Binomial regression was performed and adjusted for potential confounders.", "No association was observed between either PM2.5 or O3 concentrations and most birth defects. Positive effect estimates were observed between air pollution and microtia/anotia and lower limb deficiency defects, but the 95% confidence intervals were wide and included the null.", "Overall, this study suggested a possible relationship between air pollution concentration during early pregnancy and certain birth defects (e.g., microtia/anotia, lower limb deficiency defects), although this study did not have the power to detect such an association. The risk for most birth defects does not appear to be affected by ambient air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vinikoor-Imler", "ForeName": "Lisa C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "J Allen", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meyer", "ForeName": "Robert E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luben", "ForeName": "Thomas J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol", "NlmUniqueID": "101155107", "ISSNLinking": "1542-0752"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bayes Theorem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Congenital Abnormalities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Congenital Microtia"}, {"QualifierName": ["abnormalities"], "DescriptorName": "Ear"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gestational Age"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lower Extremity Deformities, Congenital"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "North Carolina"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23897551", "10.1002/bdra.23159"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
