The known human health effects are all on the respiratory system. At concentrations of ozone which occur during summer air-pollution episodes in many urban metropolitan areas of the United States, a portion of the healthy population is likely to experience symptoms and reversible effects on lung function, particularly if exercising heavily outdoors. More prolonged increase in airway responsiveness and the presence of inflammatory cells and mediators in the airway lining fluid may also result from these naturally occurring exposures. Serial exposures to peak levels of ozone on several consecutive days are more characteristic of pollution episodes in the Northeast United States and may be associated with recurrent symptoms. No \"high-risk\" or more sensitive group has been found, in contrast to the case of sulfur dioxide, to which asthmatics are more susceptible than normals. The occurrence of multiple exposure episodes within a single year over many years in some areas of California has led to studies looking for chronic effects of ozone exposure on the lung. To date, no conclusive studies have been reported, although further work is under way. Much of what we know about the effects of this gas on the lung are based on controlled exposures to pure gas within an environmental exposure laboratory. Interactions between substances which commonly co-occur in air-pollution episodes are also under investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beckett", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00131", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "KO7HL02316", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Yale J Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0417414", "ISSNLinking": "0044-0086"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1988 Aug;138(2):321-6", "ArticleIdList": ["3057963"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1978 Aug;118(2):287-94", "ArticleIdList": ["697179"]}, {"Citation": "J Appl Physiol (1985). 1989 Oct;67(4):1535-41", "ArticleIdList": ["2793755"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1989 Feb;79:69-72", "ArticleIdList": ["2785033"]}, {"Citation": "J Appl Physiol (1985). 1989 Jun;66(6):2756-62", "ArticleIdList": ["2745339"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1989 Feb;139(2):407-15", "ArticleIdList": ["2913889"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1989 Jan;139(1):56-61", "ArticleIdList": ["2912357"]}, {"Citation": "JAPCA. 1988 Jan;38(1):28-35", "ArticleIdList": ["3356996"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1988 Feb;137(2):313-20", "ArticleIdList": ["3341625"]}, {"Citation": "J Appl Physiol (1985). 1987 Apr;62(4):1671-80", "ArticleIdList": ["3298195"]}, {"Citation": "J Appl Physiol (1985). 1987 Sep;63(3):996-1002", "ArticleIdList": ["3654479"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1987 May;135(5):1124-8", "ArticleIdList": ["3579012"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Physiol. 1990 Jun;258(6 Pt 1):L313-20", "ArticleIdList": ["2360644"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1990 Feb;141(2):377-80", "ArticleIdList": ["2301855"]}, {"Citation": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol. 1983 May;54(5):1345-52", "ArticleIdList": ["6863094"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Pathol. 1980 Mar;98(3):811-40", "ArticleIdList": ["6767409"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1989 Aug;140(2):493-501", "ArticleIdList": ["2527482"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1750227", "PMC2589463"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
