The aim was to examine whether there is a decrease in growth when trees are exposed to higher than atmospheric concentrations of ozone. This exposure was put into effect using a free-air fumigation system at tree crown level. Growth analysis was carried out on a group of 47 spruce and 36 beech trees, where radial stem increment at breast height - a sensitive index for stress - was measured. The ozone monitoring system allowed values to be obtained for the accumulated ozone exposure (SUM00) of each individual tree, so that their radial increment over three years could be correlated with the corresponding ozone exposure for the same time period. Correlation and regression analysis were then carried out to test the influence of ozone on diameter increment. In both spruce and beech, the initial stem diameter was the most influential factor on radial increment in the following year. A linear model was applied, including the diameter of the preceding year and the ozone exposure of the current year as predicting factors. For spruce trees, a significant negative influence of ozone exposure was found. In contrast, no significant ozone effect on diameter increment of beech was detected. The effect of ozone stress on a large spruce tree can lead to a decrease in potential radial increment of 22 %. The results are discussed in relation to other stress factors such as drought and lack of light."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Forest Yield Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Am Hochanger 13, 85354 Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wipfler", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seifert", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heerdt", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Werner", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pretzsch", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Picea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16388464", "10.1055/s-2005-872871"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
