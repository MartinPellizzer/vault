The surface and structural properties of NMM were modified by the hydrothermal aging process and called H-NMM. The catalytic activity of NMM and H-NMM were evaluated for the catalytic ozonation process (COP). The synergistic effect of NMM and H-NMM in ozonation processes for 4-CP degradation under optimal conditions (pH of 7, 1\u00a0g/L of NMM and H-NMM, 0.85\u00a0mg/min of O<sub>3</sub>, and 15\u00a0min of reaction time) was measured by 3.04 and 4.34, respectively. During the hydrothermal process, Mn<sup>4+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> were converted to Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, which caused better performance of the H-NMM than the NMM. During the catalytic ozonation process, Mn<sup>2+</sup> is completely oxidized, which increases the production of Hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the system were identified using radical scavenging experiments. \u2022OH, superoxide radical (\u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) represented the dominant reactive species for 4-CP degradation. The O<sub>3</sub>/H-NMM process indicated a powerful ability in the mineralization of 4-CP (66.31% of TOC degradation). H-NMM exhibited excellent stability and reusability in consecutive catalytic cycles, and the NMM exhibited desirable performance. This study offers NMM and H-NMM as effective, stable, and competitive catalysts for hastening and enhancing the ozonation process to mitigate environmentally related pollutants of high concern."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
