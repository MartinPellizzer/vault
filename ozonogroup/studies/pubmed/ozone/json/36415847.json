As the coronavirus (Covid-19) was increasing exponentially worldwide, healthcare has been the demand for this basic equipment especiallyface protection shields have critical issues. There has been an effort to find out the different ways to conserve PPE kits, to use after the sterilization process. The current work focused onthe fabrication of the Portable PPE Kit Sterilizer model using UV Ozone Sanitization Processto utilize for recycling of N95 masks, goggles. Due to its miniature structure, can be used in public health sectors like the hospital, research centers, schools, and laboratories also. The method adopted was cheap, reuse, well suited for mass sanitization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
