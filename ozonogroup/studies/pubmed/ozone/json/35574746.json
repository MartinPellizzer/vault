The animals were routinely fed, and the operation was performed 5 days after the intervention of Ozone group by intraperitoneal injection of trioxygen water (concentration 80 mg/L, 0.01 mL/g), and the Sham group and I/R group were injected with equal volume normal saline. The Sham group only separated the arteries without ligation, and the I/R group and Ozone group established the rat cerebral I/R model. Neurological deficit score (NDS) was performed 2 hours after ischemia and modified neurological deficit score (mNSS) was performed 24 hours after reperfusion. Brain tissue was collected after anesthesia. Cerebral infarction was observed by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and the percentage of cerebral infarction volume was calculated.
