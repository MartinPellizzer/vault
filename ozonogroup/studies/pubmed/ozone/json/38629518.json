Meanwhile, all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortalities as well as economic losses attributed to O<sub>3</sub> were also estimated. The results showed that upward trends with fluctuation were observed for ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentration, mortalities, and economic losses attributable to O<sub>3</sub> exposure in the BTH Region from 2015 to 2020. The areas with high O<sub>3</sub> concentration and great changes were concentrated in the central and southwestern regions, whereas the concentration in the northern region was low, and the change degree was small. The spatial distribution of the mortalities was also consistent with the spatial distribution of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. From 2015 to 2020, the economic losses regarding all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality increased in 13 cities of the BTH Region, whereas the economic losses of respiratory mortality decreased in 4 cities in the BTH Region. The results indicated that the priority areas for O<sub>3</sub> control were not uniform. Specifically, Beijing, Tianjin, Hengshui, and Xingtai were vital areas for O<sub>3</sub> pollution control in the BTH Region. Differentiated control measures should be adopted based on the characteristics of these target areas to decline O<sub>3</sub> concentration and reduce health impacts and economic losses associated with O<sub>3</sub> exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ran", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Che", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Economic and Technological Development Zone Health Supervision Institute, Langfang 065001, China."}], "LastName": "Zu", "ForeName": "Yong-Gang", "Initials": "YG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fen", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38629518", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202305280"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
