To provide scientific data to explore the role and mechanism of differentially expressed lncRNA in damaged hearts caused by ozone sub-chronic exposure. <b>Methods:</b> Eighteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into filtered air and ozone exposure groups, with nine rats in each group. The rats in filtered air group were exposed to filtered air, while the rats in ozone exposure group were exposed to ozone at 0.5 ppm(0.980 mg/m<sup>3</sup>)for 90 days at a frequency of 6 hours per day. After ozone exposure, cardiac tissues were collected and the total RNA was extracted. The expression level of lncRNA in the hearts of two groups was detected by microarray and qRT-PCR method and the potential functions of the differentially expressed lncRNA were analyzed by bioinformatics. <b>Results:</b> Compared with the filtered air group, lncRNA's expression profile was significantly altered in the rat hearts of ozone exposure group. A total of 167 lncRNA were up-regulated significantly and 64 lncRNA were down-regulated significantly. GO analysis indicated that the up-regulated lncRNA might involve in the process of regulating growth and development, and the down-regulated lncRNA might participate in nutrient catabolic. KEGG results showed that the up-regulated lncRNA might be involved in regulating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The down-regulated lncRNA might regulate the metabolic processes of various vitamins and main energy-supplying substances. <b>Conclusion:</b> Ozone sub-chronic exposure can cause changes in the expression profile of lncRNA in rat hearts, which may regulate the effects of ozone sub-chronic exposure on the heart through the metabolism of energy and nutrients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Operational Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Tianjin 300050, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Operational Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Tianjin 300050, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Operational Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Tianjin 300050, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Operational Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Tianjin 300050, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Operational Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Tianjin 300050, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ben-Cheng", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Operational Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Tianjin 300050, China."}], "LastName": "Xi", "ForeName": "Zhu-Ge", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Operational Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Sciences, Tianjin 300050, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hua", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Ying Yong Sheng Li Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9426407", "ISSNLinking": "1000-6834"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Long Noncoding"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Long Noncoding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36062796", "10.12047/j.cjap.6267.2022.037"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
