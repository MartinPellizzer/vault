A total of 101 participants were recruited from a cohort in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, China. They underwent baseline and follow-up surveys in 2011 and 2015. DNA methylation levels were detected by bisulfite-PCR amplification and pyrosequencing. Participants' three-year average levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> compositions and ozone were estimated. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were used to examine the joint effects of pollutants on methylation levels. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> compositions and ozone mixtures at the 75th percentile was associated with increased methylation levels at CpG2 of BDNF promoter (203%, 95% CI: 89, 316) than the lowest level of exposure, and sulfate dominated the effect in the BKMR models.Our findings provide clues to the epigenetic mechanisms for the associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> compositions and ozone with BDNF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University,
