Structure and biomass of the annually formed branches were analysed after excision at the end of each season. Only at 0.1 microlitre litre(-1) was branch weight reduced, and crooked axes occurred in each season. During the second season, branch length and leaf sizes were strongly reduced, while many leaves displayed yellowish deficiency symptoms and lowered cation concentrations. Such leaves contrasted to those showing characteristic O3-bronzing. Although foliage density was enhanced due to reduced branch length, the area of attached foliage was limited by the small leaf sizes, necrotic leaves and premature leaf loss. During mid-summer of the second fumigation period, photosynthetic capacity, carboxylation efficiency and water-use efficiency (WUE) declined in (attached) yellowish and bronze leaves at 0.1 microlitre litre(-1), whereas green leaves at 0.05 microlitre litre(-1) displayed accelerated senescence in late summer while maintaining WUE. It is concluded that the differences in branch growth between the two growing seasons were caused in part by internal changes in those plant organs (root and basal stem), which had experienced both fumigation periods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstr. 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koike", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091906", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90170-s", "026974919390170S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
