Merr.] genotypes differing in sensitivity to ozone (O3 ) were investigated to determine the possible basis for the differential response. Fiskeby III (O3 -tolerant) and Mandarin (Ottawa) (O3 -sensitive) were grown in a greenhouse with charcoal-filtered air for 4 weeks, then treated with O3 for 7 h\u00b7day(-1) in greenhouse chambers. Mandarin (Ottawa) showed significantly more leaf injury and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and superoxide (O2 (-) ) production compared with Fiskeby III. Peroxidase activity in Mandarin (Ottawa) was 31% higher with O3 but was not significantly different in Fiskeby III. Ozone did not affect superoxide dismutase or glutathione reductase activities, or leaf concentrations of glutathione or ascorbic acid. Thus, variation in O3 response between Fiskeby III and Mandarin (Ottawa) was not explained by differences in antioxidant enzymes and metabolites tested. Ethylene emission from leaves declined in Fiskeby III following O3 exposure but not in Mandarin (Ottawa). Ozone exposure reduced quantum yield (\u03a6PSII ), electron transport rate (ETR) and photochemical quenching (qp ) in Mandarin (Ottawa) more than in Fiskeby III, indicating that efficiency of energy conversion of PSII and photosynthetic electron transport was altered differently in the two genotypes. Short-term exposure to O3 had minimal effects on net carbon exchange rates of both soybean cultivars. A trend toward higher stomatal conductance in Mandarin (Ottawa) suggested stomatal exclusion might contribute to differential O3 sensitivity of the two genotypes. Increased sensitivity of Mandarin (Ottawa) to O3 was associated with higher H2 O2 and O2 (-) production compared with Fiskeby III, possibly associated with genotype differences in stomatal function or regulation of ethylene during the initial phases of O3 response."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture at Kamphaeng Saen, Kasetsart University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Chutteang", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Plant Science Research, and Department of Crop Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Booker", "ForeName": "F L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sustainability Management Project, Petroleum Authority of Thailand Public Company Limited, Chatuchak, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Na-Ngern", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Plant Science Research, and Department of Crop Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Burton", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Council of Japan, Cabinet Office of Japan, Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Aoki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Plant Science Research, and Department of Crop Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Burkey", "ForeName": "K O", "Initials": "KO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25959717", "10.1111/plb.12347"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
