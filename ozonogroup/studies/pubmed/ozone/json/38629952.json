However, conventional O<sub>3</sub> monitoring approaches often suffer from limitations such as low spatiotemporal resolution, high cost, and cumbersome procedures. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines multiaxis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and machine learning (ML) technology. This approach allows the retrieval of O<sub>3</sub> profiles with exceptionally high temporal resolution at the minute level and vertical resolution reaching the hundred-meter scale. The ML models are trained using parameters obtained from radiative transfer modeling, MAX-DOAS observations, and a reanalysis data set. To enhance the accuracy of retrieving the aqueous phosphorus from O<sub>3</sub>, we employ a stacking approach in constructing ML models. The retrieved MAX-DOAS O<sub>3</sub> profiles are compared to data from an in situ instrument, lidar, and satellite observation, demonstrating a high level of consistency. The total error of this approach is estimated to be within 25%. On balance, this study is the first ground-based passive remote sensing of high time-height-resolved O<sub>3</sub> distribution from ground to the stratopause (0-60 km). It opens up new avenues for enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of O<sub>3</sub> in atmospheric environments. Moreover, the cost-effective and portable MAX-DOAS combined with this versatile profiling approach enables the potential for stereoscopic observations of various trace gases across multiple platforms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0009-8014-9369"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Sanbao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Eco-Chongming (IEC), Shanghai 202162, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Ruibin", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Zhiwen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Chuanqi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yuhao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Eco-Chongming (IEC), Shanghai 202162, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Machine Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38629952", "10.1021/acs.est.3c09099"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
