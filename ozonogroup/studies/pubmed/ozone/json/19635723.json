Methodological details were also extracted including study population, location and setting, ascertainment of MI events, adjustment for potential confounders and consideration of lagged effects.", "26 studies were identified: 19 looked at the short-term effects of pollution on a daily timescale; the remaining 7 at longer-term effects. A proportion of studies reported statistically significant detrimental effects of PM with diameter <2.5 microm (3/5 studies, risk increase estimates ranging from 5 to 17% per 10 microg/m(3) increase), PM <10 microm (3/10, 0.7-11% per 10 microg/m(3)), CO (6/14, 2-4% per ppm), SO(2) (6/13, effect estimates on varied scales) and NO(2 )(6/13, 1-9% per 10 ppb). Increasing ozone levels were associated with a reduction in MI risk in 3/12 studies. A number of differences in location, population and demographics and study methodology between studies were identified that might have affected results.", "There is some evidence that short-term fluctuations in air pollution affect the risk of MI. However, further studies are needed to clarify the nature of these effects and identify vulnerable populations and individuals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London WC1B 3DP, UK.
