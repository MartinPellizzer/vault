In order to tackle this long-standing issue, the Spanish government recently started to design the Spanish O<sub>3</sub> Mitigation Plan. To support this initiative and ultimately provide recommendations, we performed a first ambitious emission and air quality modeling exercise. This study presents the development of different emission scenarios - aligned with or beyond the measures planned for 2030 in Spain - and the modeling of their respective impact on the O<sub>3</sub> pollution across Spain (in July 2019) with both MONARCH and WRF-CMAQ air quality models. The modeling experiments include a base case scenario, a so-called planned emission (PE) scenario integrating the expected emission changes related to 2030, and a set of specific emission scenarios in which additional emission changes are applied to specific sectors (on e.g., road transport, maritime traffic) on top of the PE scenario. The planned emission scenario considerably reduces daily 8-h maximum O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (-4 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> on average), with strongest reductions in Madrid region, north of Catalonia, Valencia region, Galicia and Andalusia. The frequency of observed daily exceedances of the 120 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> daily 8-h maximum target value and 180 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> hourly information threshold could be reduced by -37 and\u00a0-77\u00a0%, respectively. The results of the specific scenarios highlight road transport and maritime traffic as two key emission sectors contributing to O<sub>3</sub> pollution, over the entire country and the Mediterranean coast, respectively, while solvent use and industry emissions have a more limited and localized impact on O<sub>3</sub>. In any case, even with the implementation of all the emission scenarios, daily exceedances of the aforementioned thresholds will still be recorded over the country."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
