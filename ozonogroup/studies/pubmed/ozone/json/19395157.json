The operation of HGRPB system was carried out in a semi-batch apparatus which combines two major parts, namely the rotating packed bed (RPB) and photo-reactor (PR). The high rotating speed of RPB can give a high volumetric gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient with one or two orders of magnitude higher than those in the conventional packed beds. The platinum-containing catalyst (Dash 220N, Pt/gamma-Al(2)O(3)) and activated alumina (gamma-Al(2)O(3)) were packed in the RPB respectively to adsorb molecular ozone and the target pollutant of phenol on the surface to catalyze the oxidation of phenol. An ultra violet (UV) lamp (applicable wavelength lambda=200-280 nm) was installed in the PR to enhance the self-decomposition of molecular ozone in water to form high reactive radical species. Different combinations of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) with the HGRPB for the degradation of phenol were tested. These included high-gravity OZ (HG-OZ), HG catalytic OZ (HG-Cat-OZ), HG photolysis OZ (HG-UV-OZ) and HG-Cat-OZ with UV (HG-Cat-UV-OZ). The decomposition efficiency of total organic compound (eta(TOC)) of HG-UV-OZ with power of UV (P(UV)) of 16W is 54% at applied dosage of ozone per volume sample m(A,in)=1200 mg L(-1) (reaction time t=20 min), while that of HG-OZ without the UV irradiation is 24%. After 80 min oxidation (m(A,in)=4800 mg L(-1)), the eta(TOC) of HG-UV-OZ is as high as 94% compared to 82% of HG-OZ process. The values of eta(TOC) for HG-Cat-OZ process with m(S)=42 g are 56% and 87% at m(A,in)=1200 and 4800 mg L(-1), respectively. By increasing the catalyst mass to 77 g, the eta(TOC) for the HG-Cat-OZ process reaches 71% and 90% at m(A,in)=1200 and 4800 mg L(-1), respectively. The introduction of Pt/gamma-Al(2)O(3) as well as UV irradiation in the HG-OZ process can enhance the eta(TOC) of phenol significantly, while gamma-Al(2)O(3) exhibits no significant effect on eta(TOC). For the HG-Cat-UV-OZ process with m(S)=42 g, the values of eta(TOC) are 60% and 94% at m(A,in)=1200 and 4800 mg L(-1), respectively. Note that the decomposition of TOC via HG-UV-OZ is already vigorous. Thus, the enhancing effect of catalyst on eta(TOC) is minor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Chia-Chi", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Chun-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Ching-Yuan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Chiung-Fen", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi-Hung", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Dar-Ren", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tseng", "ForeName": "Jyi-Yeong", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yue-Hwa", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "339NCG44TV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49DFR088MY", "NameOfSubstance": "Platinum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gravitation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Platinum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19395157", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.02.171", "S0304-3894(09)00271-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
