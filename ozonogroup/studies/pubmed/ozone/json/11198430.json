With increasing temperature of heat treatment, the amount of adsorbed BSA onto A12O3 surfaces increased, whereas the rate of BSA desorption during alkali cleaning decreased markedly, resulting in the larger amounts of BSA remaining on 12O3 surfaces. No significant amounts of BSA were removed from A12O3 surfaces by alkali cleaning alone when treated at temperatures above 120 degrees C. Before alkali cleaning, the heat-treated, BSA-fouled AI2O3 at 150 degrees C were treated with 0.05 to 0.30% (vol/vol) gaseous ozone at room temperature. Ozone pretreatment markedly accelerated the rate of BSA desorption during subsequent alkali cleaning. The effect of ozone pretreatment on BSA removal depended on the concentration of ozone and treatment time and hence on the total amount of ozone supplied. The molecular weight (MW) of desorbed BSA during alkali cleaning without ozone pretreatment coincided with the MW of the native BSA, whereas the MW of desorbed BSA during the combined ozone-alkali cleaning was lower than the MW of the native BSA. This indicated that the heat-treated BSA molecules adsorbed on A12O3 were partially decomposed into some fragments by ozone pretreatment, resulting in the facilitation of the removal of BSA during alkali cleaning."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Technology Center of Okayama Prefecture, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urano", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukuzaki", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27432CM55Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sanitation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11198430", "10.4315/0362-028x-64.1.108", "S0362-028X(22)00666-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
