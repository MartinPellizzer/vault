However, the intrinsic reason for the elevation of the regional O<sub>3</sub> is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the spatio-temporal variations of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and relevant pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO) in the BTH region based on monitoring data from the China Ministry of Ecology and Environment during the period of 2014-2019. The results showed that summertime O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were constant in Beijing (BJ, 0.06\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year)) but increased significantly in Tianjin (TJ, 9.09\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year)) and Hebei (HB, 6.06\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year)). Distinct O<sub>3</sub> trends between Beijing and other cities in BTH could not be attributed to the significant decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (from -5.08 to -6.32\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year)) and CO (from -0.053 to -0.090\u00a0mg/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year)) because their decreasing rates were approximately the same in all the cities. The relatively stable O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during the investigating period in BJ may be attributed to a faster decreasing rate of NO<sub>2</sub> (BJ: -2.55\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year); TJ: -1.16\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year); HB: -1.34\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u2022year)), indicating that the continued reduction of NO<sub>x</sub> will be an effective mitigation strategy for reducing regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Significant positive correlations were found between daily maximum 8\u00a0hr average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and vehicle population and highway freight transportation in HB. Therefore, we speculate that the increase in rural NO<sub>x</sub> emissions due to the increase in vehicle emissions in the vast rural areas around HB greatly accelerates regional O<sub>3</sub> formation, accounting for the significant increasing trends of O<sub>3</sub> in HB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
