The ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) characteristics and sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> pollution days and the control strategy of its precursors were studied using an observation-based model (OBM). It was found that the meteorological conditions were characterized by high temperature, low humidity, and low pressure in O<sub>3</sub>-pollution days. The concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors all increased in the O<sub>3</sub> pollution days. Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and alkanes were the highest-concentration components of VOCs on O<sub>3</sub> pollution days in Xinxiang, and OVOCs had the highest ozone formation potential (OFP) and hydroxyl (\u00b7OH) reactivity. According to the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) analysis, during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution days in Xinxiang, O<sub>3</sub>sensitivity was in the VOCs-limited regime in June and in the transitional regime in July and August. Ozone production was more sensitive to alkenes and OVOCs. The RIR values of the precursors in June changed throughout the day, but O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity remained the VOCs-limited regime. In July and August, O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity was the VOCs-limited regime in the morning, transitional regime at noon, transitional and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regime, respectively in the afternoon. By simulating different precursor-reduction scenarios, the results showed that the reduction of VOCs was always beneficial to the control of O<sub>3</sub>, whereas the reduction of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> had little effect on the control of O<sub>3</sub> and a risk of increasing O<sub>3</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Mo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinxiang Ecology and Environmental Monitoring Center of Henan, Xinxiang 453000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wen-Peng", "Initials": "WP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinxiang Ecology and Environmental Monitoring Center of Henan, Xinxiang 453000, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for VOCs Pollution Control Technology and Equipment, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hao-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for VOCs Pollution Control Technology and Equipment, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Li-Ya", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for VOCs Pollution Control Technology and Equipment, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Dai-Qi", "Initials": "DQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37177922", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205229"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
