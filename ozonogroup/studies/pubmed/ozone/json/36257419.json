Improving its removal performance by commonly traditional water treatment process is significant. In our study, we have found that pre-oxidation could modify the background dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties and thus improve the coagulation performance of thioethers, increasing the coagulation removal rates by 1.5-3 times. Particularly, after pre-ozonation only protein-like substances remained, and thioethers removal was 1.5 times higher than that after pre-chlorination (only coagulation not including oxidation). Compared with humic acid (HA), the thioethers compounds removal efficiencies under bovine serum albumin (BSA) as background DOM was increased by 0.3-3 times. Through Freundlich model analysis, the binding strength of BSA (K<sub>F</sub> = 20.712, at 298 K) to dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) was enhanced by 60 % compared to HA (K<sub>F</sub> = 12.778, at 298 K). According to thermodynamic parameters, the binding effect between HA/BSA and thioethers compounds was mainly van der Waals forces and hydrogen bond. BSA with more amino structure and oxygen groups was more easily to adsorb DMDS through hydrogen bond and thus achieved better coagulation performance. Therefore, pre-ozonation combined with coagulation was suggested to be more suitable for thioethers compounds control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
