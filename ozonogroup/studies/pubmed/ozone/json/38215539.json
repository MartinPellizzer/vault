The GAC adsorption showed high performance for atrazine (ATZ) removal (99.9\u00a0%), and the ozone regeneration ensured the recyclability of GAC for water purification. The regeneration process was evaluated via several paths to assist the efficient adsorption process. Employing ozone micro-nano bubbles (O<sub>3</sub>-MNBs) for regenerating GAC showed superior performance compared to traditional ozone. Meantime, inhibiting the formation of bromate (BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). ATZ adsorption process suffered from the pore-filling, hydrogen bonding effect and \u03c0-\u03c0 EDA interaction. The surface phenolic hydroxyl group, carboxyl group and pyridine nitrogen benefitted the triggering of ozone to generate reactive oxygen species, and regenerate the GAC surface. The superior performance of the adsorption and regeneration process was verified via a long-term running by a pilot study. It significantly improved the removal of organic micropollutants, UV<sub>254</sub> and permanganate index. Additionally, the intermittent O<sub>3</sub>-MNBs regeneration process resulted in efficient decontamination within the pores structure of GAC, which also effectively preserved the pore structure from destruction. For actual application, the cost of water production can be saved around 0.63\u00a0kWh m<sup>-3</sup>. This work proposed new ideas and theoretical support for economic water production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
