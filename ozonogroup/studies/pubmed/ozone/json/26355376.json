Substitution of chlorinated solvents with ter-pene-based cleaners, however, is expected to result in increased discharges to wastewater from industrial operations. A pilot-scale study was conducted at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Test & Evaluation Facility in Cincinnati, OH, to quantify the fate of specific terpene compounds in the activated sludge wastewater treatment process. Biodegradation rates of terpenes were estimated from the difference between the influent terpene mass flow rates and the amounts volatilized to air, partitioned to waste sludge, and passed through the treatment process unchanged. Any chemical transformation of the terpene compounds studied was attributed to biodegradation. Analytical methods were developed to determine ter-pene concentrations in aqueous and gaseous media. The fate of two common terpene compounds (d-limonene and terpinolene) were evaluated in three identical pilot-scale systems: (1) a system with a high target spike range (2-10 mg/L), (2) a system with a low target spike range (0.5-2 mg/L), and (3) a control system (no spike). The study showed that the primary removal mechanism for the terpene compounds in the activated sludge process is biodegradation. Typically, greater than 90% of the mass of terpenes entering the aeration basin of the activated sludge process biodegrades to other compounds; volatilization from the reaction basin accounts for less than 10%, while loss to waste activated sludge and the secondary clarifier effluent accounts for less than 1%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Risk Management Research Laboratory , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "F R", "Initials": "FR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Risk Management Research Laboratory , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shaul", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b IT Corporation , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krishnan", "ForeName": "E R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b IT Corporation , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perrin", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b IT Corporation , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26355376", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463838"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
