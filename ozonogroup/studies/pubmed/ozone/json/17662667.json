Specimens were exposed to increasing concentrations (0, 1, 3, 10 and 20% v/v) of a primary-treated effluent before and after treatment with 10 mg/L of ozone in a mesocosm-type experiment for 30 days. A suite of biomarkers was used to assess the potential neurotoxic stress of the wastewaters on these benthic invertebrates: opiate binding sites, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism, monoamines levels (serotonin, dopamine), monoamine oxidase, acetylcholinesterase and lipid peroxidation. Gametogenic activity was also determined by the gonado-somatic index and by vitellogenin-like proteins. The results show that the number of opiate binding sites increased slightly, especially after ozonation. GABA metabolism was generally reduced, suggesting higher glutamate stimulation than GABA dampening effects in mussel ganglia. This excitatory state was further confirmed by decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in gonadal tissues. The turnover of dopamine was enhanced with increased serotonin levels, but accompanied by reduced catabolism, as evidenced by decreased monoamine oxidase activity. Moreover, oxidative stress was increased, as determined by lipid peroxidation in the gonad (containing ganglia), which was significantly correlated with acetylcholinesterase activity and dopamine metabolism. The gonado-somatic index was significantly reduced with increased levels of vitellogenin-like proteins, again confirming the estrogenic action of these wastewaters. The data suggest that exposure to a primary-treated municipal effluent before and after ozonation leads to an excitotoxic syndrome implicating perturbations in GABA, dopamine and acetylcholine signaling. The increase in dopamine metabolism may be associated with the occurrence of opiate-like compounds (i.e. morphine) in the effluent. In general, ozonation reduced the severity of the responses, indicating that this disinfection strategy does not increase neurotoxicity to mussels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "St. Lawrence Centre, Environment Canada, Montr\u00e9al, Qc., Canada. francois.gagne@ec.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gagn\u00e9", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cejka", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andr\u00e9", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hausler", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blaise", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "100959500", "ISSNLinking": "1532-0456"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36B82AMQ7N", "NameOfSubstance": "Naloxone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bivalvia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ganglia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Gonads"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Naloxone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Opioid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Synaptosomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17662667", "10.1016/j.cbpc.2007.04.006", "S1532-0456(07)00124-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
