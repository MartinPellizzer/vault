Sprague-Dawley rat lungs (n = 60) were ventilated for 3 h with 95% air and 5% CO2 alone or mixed with 1 ppm ozone and perfused with buffer alone or with neutrophils (8 x 10(7)). RL, Cdyn, Ppa, airway reactivity to methacholine, lung/body weight, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein concentration, and airway lesions were analyzed using a two-way GLM or Kruskal-Wallis test (p < or = 0.05 significant). Both ozone and neutrophils increased RL and decreased Cdyn. Ozone but not neutrophils increased airway reactivity to methacholine. Neutrophils but not ozone increased lung weight/body weight and BALF protein concentration. Ozone damaged airway epithelium. In distal bronchioles, neutrophils enhanced this damage. We conclude that (1) ozone impaired pulmonary function, increased airway reactivity, and damaged airway epithelium without causing measurable microvascular leak; (2) neutrophils impaired pulmonary function, probably a result of microvascular leak, but did not change airway reactivity or damage airway epithelium; and (3) neutrophils had no effect on ozone-induced airway reactivity but had an additive effect on ozone-induced pulmonary function impairment and a synergistic effect on ozone-induced airway epithelial injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joad", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bric", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pino", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyde", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonald", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "628", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Perfusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8503571", "10.1164/ajrccm/147.6_Pt_1.1578"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
