However, for most such chemicals information on asthmatics is lacking and inter-individual assessment factors (AFs) of 3-25 have been proposed for use in the derivation of health-based guideline values.", "To evaluate available information in attempt to determine whether a general difference in airway response during short-term exposure between healthy and asthmatic individuals can be identified, and whether current AFs for inter-individual variability provide sufficient protection for asthmatics.", "After performing systematic review of relevant documents and the scientific literature estimated differential response factors (EDRF) were derived as the ratio between the lowest observed adverse effect levels for healthy and asthmatic subjects based on studies in which both groups were tested under the same conditions. Thereafter, the concentration-response relationships for healthy and asthmatic subjects exposed separately to four extensively tested chemicals (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide) were compared on the basis of combined data. Finally, a Benchmark Concentration (BMC) analysis was performed for sulfur dioxide.", "We found evidence of higher sensitivity among asthmatics (EDRF\u2009>\u20091) to 8 of 19 tested chemicals, and to 3 of 11 mixtures. Thereafter, we confirmed the higher sensitivity of asthmatics to sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide. No difference was observed in the case of ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Finally, our BMC analysis of sulfur dioxide indicated a ninefold higher sensitivity among asthmatics.", "Although experimental data are often inconclusive, our analyses suggest that an AF of 10 is adequate to protect asthmatics from the deleterious respiratory effects of airborne chemicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Unit of Work Environment Toxicology , Karolinska Institutet, Institute of Environmental Medicine , Stockholm , Sweden and."}], "LastName": "Johansson", "ForeName": "Mia K V", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Unit of Work Environment Toxicology , Karolinska Institutet, Institute of Environmental Medicine , Stockholm , Sweden and."}], "LastName": "Johanson", "ForeName": "Gunnar", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Unit of Work Environment Toxicology , Karolinska Institutet, Institute of Environmental Medicine , Stockholm , Sweden and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Swedish Toxicology Sciences Research Center , S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje , Sweden."}], "LastName": "\u00d6berg", "ForeName": "Mattias", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8914275", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8444"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O40UQP6WCF", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfuric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "American Thoracic Society.
