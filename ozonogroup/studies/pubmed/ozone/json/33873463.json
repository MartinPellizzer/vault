Gas exchange measures were estimated between sampling periods using a generalized additive regression model. \u2022\u2002Both A and P<sub>g</sub> generally declined with cumulative O<sub>3</sub> exposure or uptake at all sites. As a response variable, P<sub>g</sub> was slightly more sensitive than A to cumulative O<sub>3</sub> exposure. As a metric, O<sub>3</sub> uptake vs exposure permitted slightly better statistical resolution of seasonal response between sites. \u2022\u2002The effect of late summer drought stress was statistically significant only at the moderate pollution site, and combined synergistically with O<sub>3</sub> exposure or uptake to reduce P<sub>g</sub> . The general additive model allows the user to define a deleterious level of cumulative O<sub>3</sub> exposure or uptake, and to quantitatively assess biological response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, 4955 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, CA 92507, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grulke", "ForeName": "N E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, 4955 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, CA 92507, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Preisler", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rose", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirsch", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balduman", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Amthor JS. 1994.
