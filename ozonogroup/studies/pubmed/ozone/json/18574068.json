However, no previous study has compared the circulating nitrite concentrations in healthy pregnant women with those found in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Moreover, 2 antiangiogenic factors produced in the placenta (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endogline) may affect NO formation during pregnancy. Here, we hypothesized that lower concentrations of markers of NO formation exist in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and that inverse relationships exist between these markers and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 or soluble endogline. In this cross-sectional study, we compared 58 healthy pregnant women with 56 gestational hypertensive subjects and 45 preeclamptic patients. We measured plasma and whole blood nitrite concentrations using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay and serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endogline concentrations using enzyme immunoassays. Whole blood nitrite levels were significantly lower in gestational hypertensive subjects and preeclamptic patients (-36% and -58%, respectively; both P<0.05) compared with healthy pregnant women. The plasma nitrite levels were approximately 37% lower in both groups with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy compared with the group with normotensive pregnancies (both P<0.05). As expected, we found higher circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endogline concentrations in preeclampsia compared with gestational hypertensive subjects or with healthy pregnancies (both P<0.05). We found negative correlations between antiangiogenic factors and plasma or whole blood nitrite concentrations (Spearman's r from -0.175 to -0.226; all P<0.05). Our results show clinical evidence for impaired NO formation in preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. The negative correlations between markers of NO formation and antiangiogenic factors in preeclamptic patients suggest an inhibitory effect for these factors on NO formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, 14049-900 Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandrim", "ForeName": "Valeria C", "Initials": "VC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palei", "ForeName": "Ana C T", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Metzger", "ForeName": "Ingrid F", "Initials": "IF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomes", "ForeName": "Valeria A", "Initials": "VA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cavalli", "ForeName": "Ricardo C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanus-Santos", "ForeName": "Jose E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Hypertension", "NlmUniqueID": "7906255", "ISSNLinking": "0194-911X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, CD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ENG protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endoglin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, CD"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endoglin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Pre-Eclampsia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18574068", "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.115006", "HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.115006"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
