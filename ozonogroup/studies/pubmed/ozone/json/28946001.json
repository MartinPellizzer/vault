Pretreatment revealed that dimethyl phenyl carbinol was slowly oxidized by molecular ozone; however, it readily reacted with hydroxyl radicals to yield acetophenone as a primary product. Acetophenone was further oxidized, first through five different pathways to form benzoic acid, phenyl glyoxalic acid, 4-4'-diacetyl biphenyl, and several hydroxylated aromatic compounds, and later to aliphatic carboxylic acids via ring cleavage. Regardless of system configuration (homogeneous vs heterogeneous), operating mode (batch vs continuous), and chemical concentration, the average intrinsic rate constants were 1.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>10</sup> and 9.29\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> for dimethyl phenyl carbinol and acetophenone, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
