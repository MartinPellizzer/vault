The system utilizes hydraulic, solid-cone spray nozzles to produce simulated rainfall with droplet size distributions approximating natural rain events, which are of low intensity, i.e., about 1-1.5 cm hr(-1), and are relatively uniform in distribution of volume over a 2.4 m diameter plot. Three different pH treatments (3.1, 4.1, 5.1) were dispensed randomly to each of three treatment subplots located in twelve open-top field chambers and three ambient control chambers. Storage capacity of the system permitted a 2.3 hr rain event. Construction materials used were chosen for resistance to the corrosive nature of the rain simulant, stability to ambient UV radiation, and resistance to penetration by sunlight. Simulated events were not synchronized to ambient events, but were scheduled to prevent moisture deficits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University, 14853-1801, Ithaca, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lauver", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laurence", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohut", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0357245", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4341"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1985 Apr;77(4):944-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16664168"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21318493", "10.1007/BF01183976"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
