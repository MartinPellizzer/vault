Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) was chosen to study the influence of operating parameters. Two synthetic aluminosilicates (faujasite-Y and ZSM-5) were tested for adsorption and reactivity with ozone. The adsorption equilibrium measurement on both adsorbents showed that adsorption performance depends on temperature but is not sensitive to relative humidity, due to the hydrophobic properties of the materials. Adsorbed VOCs were oxidized at low temperature when ozonated flow was sent to the reactor. Regeneration of the fixed bed was achieved at the same time, releasing mainly CO(2) and H(2)O. Intermediates of oxidation, such as 2,3-butanedione and acetic acid, were identified, leading to incomplete mineralization. The influence of concentration and humidity are discussed. Four successive cycles were tested: after the first adsorption/ozonation cycle, the adsorption efficiency was not affected during subsequent cycles. These results show that the same sample of adsorbent can be used in the treatment process for a long time. Ozonation regeneration is a promising process for VOC removal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Chimique, UMR CNRS 5503, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, INPT, ENSIACET, 4, All\u00e9e Emile Monso, BP 84234, 31432 Toulouse Cedex 4, France. nicolas.brodu@ensiacet.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brodu", "ForeName": "Nicolas", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zaitan", "ForeName": "Hicham", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manero", "ForeName": "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pic", "ForeName": "Jean-St\u00e9phane", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Porosity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22925878", "10.2166/wst.2012.385"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
