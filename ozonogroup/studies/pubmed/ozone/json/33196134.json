The results showed that dry MgCl<sub>2</sub> and sea salt are essentially inert to gaseous HCl with a probability of less than 10<sup>-6</sup> . However, under humid conditions, HCl was found to be efficiently taken up by wet inorganic surfaces. The HCl uptake coefficient for MgCl<sub>2</sub> and sea salt increased squarely with RH, reaching a value of 0.00123 and 0.00171, respectively, at 29% RH and 298 K. Such wetting behavior is even enhanced at elevated temperatures, with the coefficient reaching 0.00208 and 0.00239, respectively, at 313 K. Based on the study of the dependence of \u03b3<sub>HCl</sub> on the initial HCl concentration, we estimate \u03b3<sub>HCl</sub> as 0.012 at 24% RH at a typical HCl concentration in the troposphere. In addition, the observation of the remarkable enhancement in the OH uptake by the HCl-treated salts agrees with the results of our previous investigation, which suggested that water absorption on salts enhances \u03b3<sub>OH</sub> by lowering the surface pH. The proposed mechanism of HCl uptake by sea salt aerosol has implications for ozone production in the marine boundary layer."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Sechenov University, Moscow, 119146, Russia."}], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "Andrey V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}], "LastName": "Molina", "ForeName": "Mario J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7371-4555"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science Education, Jeonbuk National University, Jeonju, 54896, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong-Ho", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9504818", "ISSNLinking": "1076-5174"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "6868 FR 19075-National emission standards for hazardous air pollutants: hydrochloric acid production.
