The results showed that the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Anyang increased significantly between 2014 and 2017, whereby pollution started to advance from 2015 and the earliest occurrence of an O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode was in April 2017. The 90<sup>th</sup> percentile and average concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> in the industrial zone increased at faster rates (average annual growth of 16.0 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 13.0 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively) than of those in the urban and suburban zones. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at the suburban site showed the fastest increase of all zones at the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile (average annual growth of 13.2 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>). The monthly variation in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Anyang showed an \"M\" pattern that varied spatially depending on the zone. Temperature played a leading role in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations; air temperatures >23\u2103, relative humidity <58%, and a wind speed of 5 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> in a south-southwesterly direction were closely related to the occurrence of high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Potential sources of O<sub>3</sub> in different seasons were significantly different, and mainly distributed in southern Hebei, northern Hubei, and northern Shenyang in summer. The first heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution day in the studied period was in May 2017, at which time the highest O<sub>3</sub> concentration was found in the industrial zone (up to 405 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>). This heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode was related to the continuous high temperature that was caused by the transfer of a dry, hot air mass in western China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li-Juan", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anyang Ecological Environment Bureau, Anyang 455000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Jian-You", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Fang-Cheng", "Initials": "FC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yan-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854911", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201907244"]}}]}
