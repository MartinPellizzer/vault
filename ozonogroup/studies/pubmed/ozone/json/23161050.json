The most widely used molecules are pamidronate and zoledronic acid, which are pyrophosphate analogues and are usually given to patient with bone remodelling diseases. International literature reports showed an association between this therapy and avascular necrosis, thus leading to review the guidelines for their administer.", "The authors present their protocol based upon medical treatment, antibiotic and antimycotic, together with minimally invasive surgery and ozone therapy developed after a 5 year experience to assess the viability of this treatment.", "In the last years researchers studied treatment protocols, both medical and surgical, for the management of BRONJ. Among these Ozone therapy is being adopted by several centers. From February 2004 and December 2010 a total number of 131 patients affected by BRONJ have been observed. Collected data include patients' age at the time of disorders, gender, presenting signs and symptoms, primary diagnosis, type and characteristics of the treatment performed, radiological findings and post-treatment results.", "At the present time there are no major guidelines in international literature for the treatment of BRONJ, the Authors then propose a therapeutic protocol based upon minimally invasive surgery, antibiotic and anti mycotic therapy with the adoption of ozone as regenerating factor for tissues. In 90% of the cases the results confirmed the procedure with successful outcomes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrillo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Filiaci", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramieri", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riccardi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quarato", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rinna", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gennaro", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cascino", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitro", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ungari", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9717360", "ISSNLinking": "1128-3602"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23161050"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
