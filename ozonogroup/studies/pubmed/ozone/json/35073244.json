We then restricted the analysis to hospitalizations with degrees of exposure below increasingly stringent thresholds. Furthermore, we tested effect modifications by individual- and community-level characteristics. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Each 1-\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 1-ppb increase in O<sub>3</sub>, and 1-ppb increase in NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with 0.31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.37%), 0.10% (95% CI, 0.05\u2009-\u20090.15%), and 0.28% (95% CI, 0.24\u2009-\u20090.32%) increase in risk of asthma hospitalization, respectively. Low-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> exposures were associated with higher risk. Furthermore, beneficiaries with only one asthma hospitalization during the study period or in communities with lower population density, higher average body mass index, longer distance to the nearest hospital, or greater neighborhood deprivation experienced higher risk. <b>Conclusions:</b> Short-term air pollutant exposures increased risk of asthma hospitalization among Medicaid beneficiaries, even at concentrations well below national standards. The subgroup differences suggested individual and contextual factors contributed to asthma disparities under effects of air pollutant exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yaguang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Xinye", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, and."}], "LastName": "Sabath", "ForeName": "Matthew Benjamin", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Yazdi", "ForeName": "Mahdieh Danesh", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Kanhua", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Longxiang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Peralta", "ForeName": "Adjani A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cuicui", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "Petros", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}], "LastName": "Zanobetti", "ForeName": "Antonella", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, and."}], "LastName": "Dominici", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.
