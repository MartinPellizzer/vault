In contrast, it has been shown that ozone is a more effective disinfectant than chlorine. US EPA is currently evaluating a treatment rule, which addresses the control of C. parvum oocysts in drinking water. The use of Ct (average disinfectant concentration multiplied by characteristic contact time) values is being considered as one of the options for demonstrating adequate control of this microbial contaminant. The purpose of this study is to incorporate the variability in inactivation kinetics among different lots of oocysts and to develop a statistical model for Ct based on first-order delayed Chick--Watson inactivation kinetics. A Bayesian approach is used to estimate the delayed Chick--Watson kinetic parameters. A log-linear regression analysis is then used to represent the effect of temperature on the resulting kinetic parameters. The overall model developed in this study provides an approach for water utilities and regulatory agencies to decide on the level of safety needed when developing treatment requirements for the inactivation of C. parvum oocysts with ozone as part of broader risk assessment considerations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Supply and Water Resources Division, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agency, Cincinnati, OH 45268, USA. sivaganesan.mano@epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sivaganesan", "ForeName": "Mano", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mari\u00f1as", "ForeName": "Benito J", "Initials": "BJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium parvum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oocysts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15963550", "10.1016/j.watres.2005.04.028", "S0043-1354(05)00183-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
