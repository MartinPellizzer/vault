Obesity and lack of active (ACT) lifestyle may increase susceptibility to air pollutants. We housed 22-day-old female Long-Evans rats in a cage without (SED) or with a running wheel (ACT). After 10 wk the rats ran 310 \u00b1 16.3 km. Responses of SED and ACT rats to whole-body O<sub>3</sub> (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm; 5 h/day for 2 days) was assessed. Glucose tolerance testing (GTT) was performed following the first day of O<sub>3</sub> ACT rats had less body fat and an improved glucose GTT. Ventilatory function (plethysmography) of SED and ACT groups was similarly impaired by O<sub>3</sub> Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected after the second O<sub>3</sub> exposure. SED and ACT rats were hyperglycemic following 1.0 ppm O<sub>3</sub> GTT was impaired by O<sub>3</sub> in both groups; however, ACT rats exhibited improved recovery to 0.25 and 1.0 ppm O<sub>3</sub> BALF cell neutrophils and total cells were similarly increased in ACT and SED groups exposed to 1.0 ppm O<sub>3</sub> O<sub>3</sub>-induced increase in eosinophils was exacerbated in SED rats. Chronic exercise from postweaning to adulthood improved some of the metabolic and pulmonary responses to O<sub>3</sub> (GTT and eosinophils) but several other parameters were unaffected. The reduction in O<sub>3</sub>-induced rise in BALF eosinophils in ACT rats suggests a possible link between a SED lifestyle and incidence of asthma-related symptoms from O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 the American Physiological Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicity Assessment Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and gordon.christopher@epa.gov."}], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicity Assessment Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and."}], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}], "LastName": "Ledbetter", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}], "LastName": "Snow", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}], "LastName": "Schladweiler", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicity Assessment Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and."}], "LastName": "Johnstone", "ForeName": "A F M", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "U P", "Initials": "UP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100901229", "ISSNLinking": "1040-0605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Composition"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Susceptibility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Conditioning, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Long-Evans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27836902", "10.1152/ajplung.00415.2016", "ajplung.00415.2016"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
