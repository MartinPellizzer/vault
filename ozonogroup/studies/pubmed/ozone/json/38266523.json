Ultrasonic horn at power of 130\u00a0W, frequency as 20\u00a0kHz and duty cycle as 70% was applied. Study with varying catalyst (TiO<sub>2</sub>) dose from 0.5\u00a0g/L - 2\u00a0g/L revealed 1\u00a0g/L as the optimum dose resulting in 65.15% reduction in COD. A 40\u00a0ml/L dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was shown to be optimal, giving an 81.96% reduction in COD, based on the study of varied doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from 20\u00a0ml/L to 60\u00a0ml/L. US\u00a0+\u00a0Fenton reagent combination at optimum Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (w/v) ratio of 1:1 resulted in a COD reduction of 85.29% whereas reduction of COD as 81.75% was obtained at the optimum flow rate of ozone as 1 LPM for US\u00a0+\u00a0Ozone approach. US\u00a0+\u00a0Peroxone demonstrated the best efficiency (90.48%) for COD reduction. To find the toxicity effects, the treated (US\u00a0+\u00a0peroxone) and non-treated samples were tested for the growth of bacterial cultures. It was observed that the toxicity of the treated sample increased only marginally after treatment. High-resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HR-LCMS) analysis was also performed to establish intermediate compounds. Overall, the coupling of ultrasound with oxidation processes produced better results with US\u00a0+\u00a0Peroxone established as best treatment approach for coke plant effluent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
