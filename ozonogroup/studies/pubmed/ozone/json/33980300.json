Treatment of DFUs is a major challenge and places a heavy economic and social burden on patients and their families.", "The present case report is of a 52-year-old kurdish male patient with a 7-year history of type 2 diabetes. While on a bike ride, he sustained a traumatic injury to his right leg, which caused a deep gash measuring 14 \u00d7 5 cm on the tibia. During the hospital stay, no improvement was observed after routine wound care including suturing, antibiotic therapy, and dressing change. The patient was referred to our wound-care team. In the first step, the necrotic tissues of his foot ulcer were irrigated and then debrided using mechanical debridement and saline. Next, the patient underwent a 70 \u03bcg/dL dose of ozone therapy over a 30-day period in 10 sessions (one 20-minute session every 3 days). Between each session, the patient's wound was wrapped in silver-containing gauze bandages. After 1 month of wound-care using ozone therapy, the patient's foot ulcer had healed and he was discharged from our wound-care service with a stable and good general condition.", "Considering the effectiveness of ozone therapy along with silver-containing dressing in the treatment of DFUs, wound-care teams can utilize it as an adjunct to the standard methods of DFU treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Nursing and Midwifery Faculty, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Campus Nazlu, 11 KM Road Seru, 575611-5111, Urmia, West Azerbaijan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faraji", "ForeName": "Navid", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7843-0084"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical-Surgical Nursing, Nursing and Midwifery Faculty, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Campus Nazlu, 11 KM Road Seru, 575611-5111, Urmia, West Azerbaijan, Iran.
