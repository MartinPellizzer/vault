Ground cotton stalks at a solid loading of 10% (w/v) were pretreated with H(2)SO(4), NaOH, and H(2)O(2) at concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% (w/v). Treatment temperatures of 90 degrees C and 121 degrees C at 15 psi were investigated for residence times of 30, 60, and 90 min. Ozone pretreatment was performed at 4 degrees C with constant sparging of stalks in water. Solids from H(2)SO(4), NaOH, and H(2)O(2) pretreatments (at 2%, 60 min, 121 degrees C/15 psi) showed significant lignin degradation and/or high sugar availability and hence were hydrolyzed by Celluclast 1.5L and Novozym 188 at 50 degrees C. Sulfuric acid pretreatment resulted in the highest xylan reduction (95.23% for 2% acid, 90 min, 121 degrees C/15 psi) but the lowest cellulose to glucose conversion during hydrolysis (23.85%). Sodium hydroxide pretreatment resulted in the highest level of delignification (65.63% for 2% NaOH, 90 min, 121 degrees C/15 psi) and cellulose conversion (60.8%). Hydrogen peroxide pretreatment resulted in significantly lower (p<or=0.05) delignification (maximum of 29.51% for 2%, 30 min, 121 degrees C/15 psi) and cellulose conversion (49.8%) than sodium hydroxide pretreatment, but had a higher (p<or=0.05) cellulose conversion than sulfuric acid pretreatment. Ozone did not cause any significant changes in lignin, xylan, or glucan contents over time. Quadratic models using time, temperature, and concentration as continuous variables were developed to predict xylan and lignin reduction, respectively for sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide pretreatments. In addition, a modified severity parameter (log M(0)) was constructed and explained most of the variation in xylan or lignin reduction through simple linear regressions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Campus Box 7625, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7625, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silverstein", "ForeName": "Rebecca A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma-Shivappa", "ForeName": "Ratna R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boyette", "ForeName": "Michael D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osborne", "ForeName": "Jason", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioresour Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9889523", "ISSNLinking": "0960-8524"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "55X04QC32I", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O40UQP6WCF", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Energy Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gossypium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17158046", "10.1016/j.biortech.2006.10.022", "S0960-8524(06)00578-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
