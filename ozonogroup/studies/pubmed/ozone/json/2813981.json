One group of 5 dogs was studied before treatment with nebulized saline and then after exposure to ozone (3 ppm, 1 h); another group of 6 dogs was studied before treatment with ambroxol (100 breaths of a 1% solution) and after exposure to ozone. On each occasion, we measured airway responsiveness to acetylcholine and counted the number of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. When the dogs were given the saline placebo, ozone induced a marked increase in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine and a marked influx of neutrophils in the airways. When the dogs were given ambroxol, ozone induced the same increase in the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage, but did not increase the degree of airway responsiveness to acetylcholine. We conclude that ambroxol inhibits ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in dogs, probably by inhibiting the formation and release of oxygenation products of arachidonic acid from neutrophils."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Medicine, University of Padua, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chitano", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Stefano", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finotto", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zavattini", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maestrelli", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mapp", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabbri", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allegra", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Respiration", "NlmUniqueID": "0137356", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7931"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "200168S0CL", "NameOfSubstance": "Ambroxol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q1J152VB1P", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromhexine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ambroxol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromhexine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2813981", "10.1159/000195755"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
