In this article, we introduce a method to quantify such lags by adapting the visibility graph algorithm, which converts time series into a mathematical graph. Currently widely used method to detect such lags is based on cross-correlations, which has certain limitations. We present simulated examples where the new method identifies the lag correctly and unambiguously while as the cross-correlation method does not. The article includes results from an extensive simulation study conducted to better understand the scenarios where the new method performed better or worse than the existing approach. We also present a likelihood based parametric modeling framework and consider frameworks for quantifying uncertainty and hypothesis testing for the new approach. We apply the current and new methods to two case studies, one from neuroscience and the other from environmental epidemiology, to illustrate the methods further."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4596-245X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Feinstein Institute of Medical Research, Northwell Health System, Manhasset, NY, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Psychiatry Research, Zucker Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "John", "ForeName": "Majnu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, SUNY Downstate, Brooklyn, NY, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, SUNY Downstate, Brooklyn, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Ferbinteanu", "ForeName": "Janina", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 MH117646", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R21 MH122886", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 MH109508", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 MH108654", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R21 MH106708", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 MH120313", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R34 MH103835", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Commun Stat Case Stud Data Anal Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "101698538", "ISSNLinking": "2373-7484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Achard S, and Gannaz I. 2016. \u201cMultivariate Wavelet Whittle Estimation in Long-Range Dependence.\u201d Journal of Time Series Analysis 37 (4):476\u2013512."}, {"Citation": "Achard S, and Gannaz I. 2019a. \u201cWavelet-Based and Fourier-Based MultivariateWhittle Estimation: Multiwave.\u201d Journal of Statistical Software 89 (6):1\u201331."}, {"Citation": "Achard S, and Gannaz I. 2019b. \u201cmultiwave: Estimation of Multivariate Long-Memory Models Parameters.\u201d R Package Version 1.4. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multiwave."}, {"Citation": "Baldi P, Rinott Y, and Stein C. 1989. \u201cA Normal Approximation for the Number of Local Maxima of a Random Function on a Graph.\u201d In Probability, Statistics, and Mathematics, 59\u201381.
