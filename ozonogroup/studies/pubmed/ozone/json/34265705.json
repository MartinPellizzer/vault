The results indicated that the maximum removal efficiency of EDCs occurred at or near pH 7.0 when measured over a pH range of 4.0-10.0. The addition of natural colloids had a two-part influence. While the floc generated by polyaluminium chloride (PAC) significantly increased in size from 198.0\u00a0\u03bcm to 290.4\u00a0\u03bcm with a simultaneous improvement in the removal efficiency of EDCs, the floc size generated by polyferric sulfate (PFS) had no worthwhile change except for a slight decrement. The removal efficiency of EDCs and the decrease in spectral parameters including UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence during ozonation processes with and without pre-coagulation were investigated. During the ozonation process, efficient elimination of target EDCs are achieved at low O<sub>3</sub> doses (O<sub>3</sub>/dissolved organic carbon (DOC)\u00a0<\u00a00.2) in different water matrices. The pH-titration differential absorbance spectra technique further demonstrated that the high reactivity of O<sub>3</sub> to EDCs is owing to their phenolic moieties. In addition, when mgO<sub>3</sub>/mgDOC ratio reaches to ~0.40, >90% of estrogenic activity was eliminated. In a nutshell, ozonation with pre-coagulation together leads to considerably higher abatement of EDCs and estradiol (E2) equivalent values (EEQ) at the same ozone dosage than ozonation only process for wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
