Laboratory-scale column experiments were therefore conducted with soil artificially contaminated by diesel fuel as a surrogate for alkanes of environmental relevance. Particular attention was paid to saturated hydrocarbons refractory to volatilization. Reaction conditions involve 1485mgkg(-1) of the initial concentration of diesel range organics (DRO) and a constant ozone concentration of 119+/-6mgl(-1) at the flow rate of 50mlmin(-1). The observed removal of DRO reached 94% over 14h of continuous ozone injection. Ozone oxidation demonstrated effective removal of non-volatile DRO in the range of C(12)-C(24). Each alkane compound displayed comparable degradation kinetics, suggesting virtually no selectivity of ozone reactions with alkanes in soil. A pseudo-first order kinetic model closely simulated the removal kinetics, yielding a reaction rate constant of 0.213 (+/-0.021)h(-1) and a half-life of 3.3 (+/-0.3)h under the experimental conditions used in this study. An estimate of ozone demand was 32mg of O(3) (mgDRO)(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2051, United States. doyun_yu@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Do-Yun", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Namgoo", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Wookeun", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banks", "ForeName": "M Katherine", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16872663", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.06.053", "S0045-6535(06)00812-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
