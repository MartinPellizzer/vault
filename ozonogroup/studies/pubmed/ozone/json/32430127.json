In this study, VOC emission factors, O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation potentials were estimated for two types of industrial boilers: coal-fired boilers (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and oil-fired boilers (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Results showed that \u2211VOCs concentrations were more than nine times higher for oil-fired boilers compared to those for coal-fired boilers. Emission factors of \u2211VOCs were found to be higher for oil-fired boilers (9.26-32.83\u00a0mg-VOC/kg) than for coal-fired boilers (1.57-4.13\u00a0mg-VOC/kg). Alkanes and aromatics were obtained as the most abundant groups in coal-fired boilers, while oxygenated organics and aromatics were the most contributing groups in oil-fired boilers. Benzene, n-hexane and o-ethyl toluene were the abundant VOC species in coal-fired boiler emissions, whereas toluene was the most abundant VOC species emitted from oil-fired boilers. O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation potentials were found 12 and 18 times, respectively, higher for oil-fired than for coal-fired boilers. Total OFP ranged from 3.99 to 11.39\u00a0mg-O<sub>3</sub>/kg for coal-fired boilers. For oil-fired boilers, total OFP ranged from 36.16 to 131.93\u00a0mg-O<sub>3</sub>/kg. Moreover, total secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP) ranged from 65.4 to 122.5\u00a0mg-SOA/kg and 779.9 to 2252.5\u00a0mg-SOA/kg for the coal-fired and oil-fired boilers, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
