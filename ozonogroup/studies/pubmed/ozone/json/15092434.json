However, previously published model results indicate that the consequences of NO(x) controls can be quite different on these different time scales. In this paper we analyse the impact of a consistent set of NO(x) control scenarios on both the episodic and annual time-scales. Using similar models, we compute levels of episode peak O(3) and NO(2) and annual NO(y)-N and total N deposition at three locations in Europe due to six emission scenarios derived from OECD estimates. An NO(x) control scenario which reduces European emissions by 63%, only results in total annual N deposition reductions of 19, 36 and 26% at the three locations examined because of the influence of ammonia-nitrogen deposition. The same scenario results in either increases or decreases in episode peak O(3) due to the influence of hydrocarbons. Emission reduction strategies should take into account not only NO(x) emissions, but emissions of other pollutants, such as hydrocarbons and ammonia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2 rue Andre Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fcbkert", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derwent", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alcamo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bartnicki", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092434", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90067-5", "0269749189900675"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
