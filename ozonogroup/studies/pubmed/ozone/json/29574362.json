Nitrogen-enriched rivers are significant sources of atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O. This study conducted a one-year field campaign in seven N-enriched rivers draining urban, rural, and agricultural land to determine the link between the production, concentrations, and emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and land use. Estimated N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes varied between 1.30 and 1164.38\u202f\u03bcg\u202fN<sub>2</sub>O-N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> with a mean value of 154.90\u202f\u03bcg\u202fN<sub>2</sub>O-N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, indicating that rivers were the net sources of atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O. Concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O ranged between 0.23 and 29.21\u202f\u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O-N L<sup>-1</sup> with an overall mean value of 3.81\u202f\u03bcg\u202fN<sub>2</sub>O-N L<sup>-1</sup>. Concentrations of ammonium and nitrate in urban and rural rivers were high in the cold season. The concentrations were also high in agricultural rivers in the wet season. N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations and emissions in rural and urban rivers followed a similar pattern to ammonium and a similar pattern to nitrate in agricultural rivers. A strong link between the concentrations and emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and land use was observed. N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations in and emissions from the rivers draining the urban and rural areas were significantly higher than the rivers draining the agricultural areas (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). Stepwise regression analysis indicated that dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O were primarily influenced by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in agricultural rivers and by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in rural rivers; while dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O in urban rivers was primarily predicted by temperature and reflected the integrated impact of sewage input and river hydrology. Nitrate-N and NO<sup>3-</sup>-O isotope data and linear regression of N<sub>2</sub>O and river water variables strongly indicated that dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O was mainly derived from nitrification in agricultural rivers and denitrification in rural and urban rivers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
