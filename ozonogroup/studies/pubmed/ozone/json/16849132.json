Synthetic wastewater bearing these tannin formulations was individually prepared and subjected to ozonation at varying doses (500 and 1000 mg h-1), and pHs (3.5 and 7.0) to elucidate the effect of ozone dose and pH on oxidation efficiency. Changes in the environmental sum parameters chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), 5th-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm wavelength (UV280) and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm wavelength (UV254), the latter two representing the aromaticity and double bonds of the studied textile tannins, respectively, were monitored during the course of ozonation. In the second part of the study, the biodegradability and acute toxicity of the raw and pre-ozonated textile tannins were evaluated in terms of the BOD5 parameter and an activated sludge inhibition test, respectively. Results indicated no significant changes in acute toxicity for NT, whereas the inhibitory effect of ST could be completely eliminated after 40 min ozonation at a rate of 1000 mg h-1 (i.e., at a specific ozone dose of 1.4 mg (O)3 (mg COD0)-1 and a pH of 3.5. In conclusion, pre-ozonation appeared to be potential pretreatment option to achieve complete detoxification and a fair biodegradability improvement of the otherwise refractory synthetic tannin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koyunluoglu", "ForeName": "Sebnem", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arslan-Alaton", "ForeName": "Idil", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eremektar", "ForeName": "Gulen", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Germirli-Babuna", "ForeName": "Fatos", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16849132", "10.1080/10934520600779083", "P872371X370P541K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
