Previous studies indicated that over 90% of microplastics, especially microfibers from laundry wastewater, are retained in primary sludge. The effect of microfibers from household laundry on anaerobic digestion has yet to be fully understood, which is the objective of the present study. The results in this study showed a positive correlation between methane production and the presence of microfibers. Compared to the control, the methane production increased by 2%, 27% and 43% with 20\u00a0mg/L, 100\u00a0mg/L and 1000\u00a0mg/L microfibers spiked into primary sludge, respectively. The present study suggests that microfibers at 20\u00a0mg/L insignificantly affected methane production in controlled anaerobic digestion. In contrast, ozone pretreatment of microfibers enhanced gas production by 12% in the same concentration level. Interestingly, ozone pretreatment at a higher concentration (100\u00a0mg/L-1000\u00a0mg/L) of microfibers did not affect methane production. SEM/EDX results imply that the ozone pretreatment has changed the surface characteristics of the microfibers, which provide more surface area for adsorption. The significant reduction of soluble phosphorus by 58% indicates that microfibers potentially act as a site for adsorption during anaerobic digestion. Overall, the presence of microfibers had a positive effect on anaerobic digestion. However, this work also indicated that the microfibers were not biodegraded during anaerobic digestion. Therefore, microfibers accumulate on biosolids, potentially affecting the final disposal of microfibers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
