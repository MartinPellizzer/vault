The treatment efficiency and the transformation characteristics of refractory organics and reactive oxygen species were determined. It was found that an acidic environment and an increase in the O<sub>3</sub> dosage improved the organic removal efficiency in the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, and the use of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> improved the treatment efficiency, while excessive H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inhibited it. In the MW/PS process, an increase in the PS dosage and MW power greatly improved the treatment efficiency, while an alkaline environment inhibited it. Under the optimized reaction parameters, the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MW/PS processes effectively degraded refractory organics (i.e., humic acid and fulvic acid) into components with a smaller molecular weight and simpler structure. The humification, aromaticity, and conjugation of organics in wastewater were greatly reduced. Compared to the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, the MW/PS process had a better treatment effect on refractory organics, and there were more low molecular weight organics (<1 kDa) in the treated wastewater. Because O<sub>3</sub> is the main selective oxidant in the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, a large amount of organic acids were accumulated. A large amount of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals with strong oxidation ability were produced in the MW/PS process, and therefore the combined action of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals can efficiently decompose humus and intermediate organics. Overall, the MW/PS process was more effective in treating the MBR effluent than the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. The results of this study provide a reference for the selection of an advanced oxidation process to eliminate refractory organics in landfill leachate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
