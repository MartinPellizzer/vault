Moreover, the chemical production sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> at different height layers was analyzed using HCHO/NO<sub>2</sub> ratios. The results revealed that the wintertime averaged highest concentrations of aerosol (1.25\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>), NO<sub>2</sub> (14.81\u00a0ppb), and HCHO (2.32\u00a0ppb) were mainly distributed at the surface layer, 100-200\u00a0m layer, and 200-300\u00a0m layer, respectively. Regarding the diurnal cycles, high concentrations of aerosol (>1.4\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>) and NO<sub>2</sub> (>16.0\u00a0ppb) usually appeared in the early morning and late afternoon, while high concentrations of HCHO (>2.5\u00a0ppb) usually occurred during 12:00-15:00. The PSCF model revealed that the wintertime aerosol mainly originated from Shandong, northern Jiangsu, Korea, and the northwestern Mongolian Plateau. Below 200\u00a0m, NO<sub>2</sub> was mainly from western Shandong, whereas above 600\u00a0m, it was mainly from northern Shandong and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The corresponding sources for HCHO were central and southern Shandong (below 200\u00a0m) and northern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and southeastern BTH (above 600\u00a0m). In addition, the chemical production sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> below 100\u00a0m was observed only in the VOC-limited regime. The percentages of O<sub>3</sub> production under the NO<sub>x</sub>-limited, NO<sub>x</sub>-VOC-limited, and VOC-limited regimes were 10.75% (31.18%), 4.30% (19.35%), and 84.95% (49.47%) at the 500-600\u00a0m (900-1000\u00a0m) layer. This study has guiding significance for the coordinated control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, and can assist in the implementation of regional joint prevention and control strategies for air pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
