This study aimed to determine the levels of lutein and protein in corn before and after ozonation and to verify the antimutagenic potential of the extracted lutein against aflatoxin using the Ames test. The lutein content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Nitrogen analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to analyze protein. Clean ozone-treated corn had a total lutein content of 28.36 microg/g, which was higher than that of 22.75 microg/g in the untreated clean corn. However, the lutein content was 11.69 microg/g in the ozone-treated contaminated corn, which was lower than that of 16.42 microg/g in the untreated contaminated corn. In both corn samples, the protein content of ozone-treated corn was lower than that of untreated corn, indicating that protein could be destroyed by the ozonation process, which may influence the nutritious value of the corn. Lutein extracts alone showed no mutagenic potential against Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA100. Lutein extracts from corn inhibited the mutagenicity of AFB1 in a dose-response manner more efficiently than lutein standard. Lutein extracts from different corn samples had similar antimutagenic potentials against AFB1, so the ozone treatment did not affect the antimutagenic potentials of lutein extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, 111 Food Science Building, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "King", "ForeName": "Joan M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhimin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Losso", "ForeName": "Jack", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prudente", "ForeName": "Alfredo", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X72A60C9MT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lutein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lutein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18681445", "10.1021/jf801562v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
