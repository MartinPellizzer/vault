The simulation reasonably reproduced the significantly high upper tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (up to 145ppb) caused by BB emissions. We find the BB-induced O<sub>3</sub> was primarily affected by chemical reactions and dispersion during its transport. In the early period of transport, high NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs emissions caused O<sub>3</sub> production due to reactions with the peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, HO<sub>2</sub> and OH. Here, NO<sub>x</sub> played a key role in O<sub>3</sub> formation in the BB plume. The results indicated that HO<sub>2</sub> in the BB plume primarily came from formaldehyde (HCHO+hv=2HO<sub>2</sub>+CO), a secondary alkoxy radical (ROR=HO<sub>2</sub>). CO played an important role in the production of recycled HO<sub>2</sub> (OH+CO=HO<sub>2</sub>) because of its abundance in the BB plume. The chemically produced HO<sub>2</sub> was largely converted to OH by the reactions with NO (HO<sub>2</sub>+NO=OH+NO<sub>2</sub>) from BB emissions. This is in contrast to the surface, where HO<sub>2</sub> and OH are strongly affected by VOC and HONO, respectively. In the late stages of transport, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration was primarily controlled by dispersion. It stayed longer in the upper troposphere compared to the surface due to sustained depletion of NO<sub>x</sub>. Sensitivity analysis results support that O<sub>3</sub> in the BB plume is significantly more sensitive to NO<sub>x</sub> than VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
