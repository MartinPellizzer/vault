The objective of this study was to determine whether MS2 coliphage was a suitable indicator for the inactivation of enteric viruses when ozone disinfection systems were used. Bench-scale experiments were conducted in 2-liter-batch shrinking reactors containing ozone demand-free 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) at 22 degrees C. Ozone was added as a side stream from a concentrated stock solution. It was found that an ozone residual of less than 40 micrograms/liter at the end of 20 s inactivated greater than 99.99% of MS2 coliphage in the demand-free buffer. When MS2 was compared directly with poliovirus type 3 in paired experiments, 1.6 log units more inactivation was observed with MS2 coliphage than with poliovirus type 3. It was concluded that the use of MS2 coliphage as a surrogate organism for studies of enteric virus with ozone disinfection systems overestimated the inactivation of enteric viruses. It is recommended that the regulatory agencies evaluate their recommendations for using MS2 coliphage as an indicator of enteric viruses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finch", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fairbairn", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Buffers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Buffers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Coliphages"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Poliovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Activation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Presse Med. 1964 Sep 12;72:2153-6", "ArticleIdList": ["14186308"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1989 Nov;55(11):2949-53", "ArticleIdList": ["2560362"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1989 Sep;55(9):2230-41", "ArticleIdList": ["2679383"]}, {"Citation": "Presse Med. 1967 Sep 23;75(38):1883-4", "ArticleIdList": ["4294426"]}, {"Citation": "J Hyg (Lond). 1984 Aug;93(1):157-63", "ArticleIdList": ["6086748"]}, {"Citation": "J Water Pollut Control Fed. 1973 Dec;45(12):2433-43", "ArticleIdList": ["4358738"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1987 Dec;53(12):2894-6", "ArticleIdList": ["3324969"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1664198", "PMC183936", "10.1128/aem.57.11.3121-3126.1991"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
