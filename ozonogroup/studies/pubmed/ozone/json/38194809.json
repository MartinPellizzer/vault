A series of batch experiments revealed that particle concentrations up to 30\u00a0mg/L had a minor impact on the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in the aqueous phase. Moreover, the reduction of UV absorbance at 254\u00a0nm (UVA<sub>254</sub>) was negatively correlated to the level of particle concentration at ozone doses higher than 0.5 gO<sub>3</sub>/gDOC. It indicates that UVA<sub>254</sub> abatement was more sensitive to the presence of particles compared to OMP removal. Organic micropollutants (OMPs) sorbed on effluent particles and sludge particles were extracted before and after ozonation. OMP sorption in effluent particles was 2-5 times higher than that in sludge particles. During the ozonation of raw secondary effluent, particle-bound micropollutants were removed comparably to the micropollutants in the aqueous phase. This suggests that the boundary layer surrounding the particle didn't affect the removal of OMPs in the particle phase. Furthermore, the removal of existing OMPs (irbesartan, sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol) in the effluent was used to assess the ozone and \u2022OH exposure. In water samples with and without particles, the elimination of OMPs could be reliably predicted (R\u00b2 > 0.95) by calculated ozone and \u2022OH exposures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
