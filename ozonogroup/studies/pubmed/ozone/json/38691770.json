Here, we assess the heterogeneous chemistry of gaseous O<sub>3</sub> with glass plates after being 1 month in two different kitchens where Chinese and Western styles of cooking were applied, respectively. The uptake coefficients of O<sub>3</sub> on the authentic glass plates were measured in the dark and under UV light irradiation typical for indoor environments (320 nm < \u03bb < 400 nm) at different relative humidities. The gas-phase product compounds formed upon reactions of O<sub>3</sub> with the glass plates were evaluated in real time by a proton-transfer-reaction quadrupole-interface time-of-flight mass spectrometer. We observed typical aldehydes formed by the O<sub>3</sub> reactions with the unsaturated fatty acid constituents of cooking oils. The formation of decanal, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA) was also observed. The employed dynamic mass balance model shows that the estimated mixing ratios of hexanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, undecanal, 6-MHO, and 4-OPA due to O<sub>3</sub> chemistry with authentic grime-coated kitchen glass surfaces are higher in the kitchen where Chinese food was cooked compared to that where Western food was cooked. These results show that O<sub>3</sub> chemistry on greasy glass surfaces leads to enhanced VOC levels in indoor environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier":
