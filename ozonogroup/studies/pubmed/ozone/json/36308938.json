Soil particle distribution within the reactor was simulated with Euler-Euler and Gidaspow drag models, and a bipolar pulsed power supply was applied to energize the DBD reactor after full fluidized. The effect of soil particles movement on electric features was discussed in terms of voltage waveforms and Lissajous figures. Lindane degradation was found to be related to electrics parameters and soil properties. Soil samples before and after treatment were analyzed by XRD and SEM methods. A 95.98% lindane decomposition and 0.66\u00a0mg<sub>Lindane</sub>/h average reaction rate were obtained with 3\u00a0wt% CaO injection by pulse power drove fluidization-like DBD after 32\u00a0min treatment. Ozone was proved to play a major role during lindane degrading by plasma. The reaction potential pathway of lindane decomposition contains 4 steps, including dehydrogen, dehydrochlorination, and dechlorination, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
