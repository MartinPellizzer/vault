Kolmogorov-Zurbenko \uff08KZ\uff09 filtering was employed to separate the original O<sub>3</sub>-8h series into components at different time scales. Then, multiple linear regression of meteorological variables was used to quantitatively isolate the effects of meteorology and emissions. The results revealed that the annual mass concentrations of surface O<sub>3</sub>-8h from 2015 to 2021 in 12 cities over the QXP ranged from 78.7 to 156.7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the exceedance rates of O<sub>3</sub> mass concentrations \uff08National Air Quality Standard of grade II\uff09 ranged from 0.7%-1.5%. The monthly O<sub>3</sub>-8h mass concentration displayed a single-peak inverted \"V\"-shape and a multi-peak \"M\"-shape. The maximum monthly concentration of O<sub>3</sub> occurred in April to July, and valleys occurred in July, September, and December. The short-term, seasonal, and long-term components of O<sub>3</sub>-8hdecomposed by KZ filtering contributed 29.6%, 51.4%, and 9.1% to the total variance in the original O<sub>3</sub> sequence in 12 cities, respectively. From the whole region, the meteorological conditions were unfavorable for O<sub>3</sub> reduction on the QXP from 2015 to 2017, which made the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub> increase by 0.2-2.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The meteorological conditions were favorable for O<sub>3</sub>-8h reduction from 2018 to 2021, which led to the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub>-8h decrease by 0.4-1.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The meteorological conditions increased the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub>-8h in Ngari, Lhasa, Naqu, Nyingchi, Qamdo, Haixi, and Xining, with an average contribution of 30.1%. The meteorological conditions decreased the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub>-8h in Shigatse and Golog, with contributions of 359.0% and 56.5%, respectively. The increase in the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub>-8h in Ngari, Shigatse, Nagqu, Haixi, and Xining could be due to the rapid decrease in the long-term component of PM<sub>2.5</sub> \uff084.04 \u03bcg\u00b7\uff08m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a\uff09<sup>-1</sup>\uff09."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yong", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Ji-Qiang", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jun-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Fang-Cheng", "Initials": "FC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39022926", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202308039"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
