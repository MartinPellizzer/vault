Previous studies evaluating the associations between air pollution exposure and BP did not consider the effect that air pollutant mixtures may have on BP. We investigated the effect of exposure to single species or their synergistic effects as air pollution mixture on ambulatory BP. Using portable sensors, we measured personal concentrations of black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen monoxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and particles with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). We simultaneously collected ambulatory BP measurements (30-min intervals, N\u00a0=\u00a03319) of 221 participants over one day of their lives. Air pollution concentrations were averaged over 5\u00a0min to 1\u00a0h before each BP measurement, and inhaled doses were estimated across the same exposure windows using estimated ventilation rates. Fixed-effect linear models as well as quantile G-computation techniques were applied to associate air pollutants' individual and combined effects with BP, adjusting for potential confounders. In mixture models, a quartile increase in air pollutant concentrations (BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, CO, and O<sub>3</sub>) in the previous 5\u00a0min was associated with a 1.92\u00a0mmHg (95% CI: 0.63, 3.20) higher systolic BP (SBP), while 30-min and 1-h exposures were not associated with SBP. However, the effects on diastolic BP (DBP) were inconsistent across exposure windows. Unlike concentration mixtures, inhalation mixtures in the previous 5\u00a0min to 1\u00a0h were associated with increased SBP. Out-of-home BC and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were more strongly associated with ambulatory BP outcomes than in-home concentrations. In contrast, only the in-home concentration of CO reduced DBP in stratified analyses. This study shows that exposure to a mixture of air pollutants (concentration and inhalation) was associated with elevated SBP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
