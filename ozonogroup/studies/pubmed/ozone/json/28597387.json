Six experimental conditions were designed to completely examine the experimental reactor, including photolysis, photocatalysis, ozonation, photolytic ozonation, catalytic ozonation, and photocatalytic ozonation. The stationary catalyst construction was made from commercially available TiO<sub>2</sub> nanopowder by mounting it on a glass support and subsequently characterized for morphology (X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy) as well as durability. The ozone was generated in a dielectrical barrier discharge reactor using air as a source of oxygen. The degradation efficiency was estimated by the decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) concentration as well as toxicity using Daphnia magna, and degradation by-products by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The photocatalytic ozonation was the most effective for the treatment of all model wastewater. The photocatalytic ozonation was most effective against ozonation and photolytic ozonation at tested pH values. A complete toxicity loss was obtained after the treatment using photocatalytic ozonation. The possible degradation pathway of the phthalate by oxidation was suggested based on aromatic ring opening reactions. The catalyst used at this experiment confirmed as a durable for continuous use with almost no loss of activity over time. The design of the reactor was found to be very effective for water treatment using photocatalytic ozonation. Such design has a high potential and can be further upscaled to industrial applications due to the simplicity and versatility of manufacturing and maintenance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Technology, Kaunas University of Technology, Radvilenu pl. 19, LT-50254, Kaunas, Lithuania. martynas.tichonovas@ktu.lt."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1450-9679"], "LastName": "Tichonovas", "ForeName": "Martynas", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Technology, Kaunas University of Technology, Radvilenu pl. 19, LT-50254, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krugly", "ForeName": "Edvinas", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Technology, Kaunas University of Technology, Radvilenu pl. 19, LT-50254, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jankunaite", "ForeName": "Dalia", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Technology, Kaunas University of Technology, Radvilenu pl. 19, LT-50254, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Racys", "ForeName": "Viktoras", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Technology, Kaunas University of Technology, Radvilenu pl. 19, LT-50254, Kaunas, Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martuzevicius", "ForeName": "Dainius", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P2Z71CIK5H", "NameOfSubstance": "2-naphthol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2016 Apr;23(8):7962-74", "ArticleIdList": ["26769481"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2015 Mar 21;285:398-408", "ArticleIdList": ["25528240"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2015 Jul 1;520:23-31", "ArticleIdList": ["25791053"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2015 Feb;121:1-17", "ArticleIdList": ["25479808"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2010 Feb;78(9):1142-7", "ArticleIdList": ["20074775"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2007 Nov 28;55(24):9944-50", "ArticleIdList": ["17960885"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2008 May;72(2):133-40", "ArticleIdList": ["18372002"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2012 Nov;19(9):3688-95", "ArticleIdList": ["23054730"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2008 Dec;42(20):5011-21", "ArticleIdList": ["18947853"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2014 Jan 30;265:69-78", "ArticleIdList": ["24333716"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2006 Aug 31;367(2-3):681-93", "ArticleIdList": ["16581108"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2016 Nov 15;318:15-23", "ArticleIdList": ["27388420"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2016 May 1;94:10-22", "ArticleIdList": ["26921709"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28597387", "10.1007/s11356-017-9381-y", "10.1007/s11356-017-9381-y"]}}]}
