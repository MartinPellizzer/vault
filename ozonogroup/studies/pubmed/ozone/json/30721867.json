The receptor model-based analysis was performed using the datasets collected from four different sites from the megacity of Seoul during the years 2013-2015. The contributions of VOC emission sources to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and the subsequent health effects in the study area were also assessed during a photochemically active period (June 2015) using a three-dimensional CTM, Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ), and the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP). The solvent use and the on-road mobile emission sources were found to exert dominant controls on the VOC levels observed in the target city. VOCs transported from regions outside of Seoul accounted for a significant proportion (up to approximately 35%) of ambient VOC levels during the study period. The solvent use accounted for 3.4% of the ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during the day (daily mean of 2.6%) and made insignificant contributions to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (<1%) during the simulation period. Biogenic VOC made insignificant contributions to O<sub>3</sub> (<1%) and a small contribution to PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the day (5.6% with a daily mean of 2.4%). The number of premature deaths attributed indirectly (O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> formations via the oxidation of VOCs) to solvent use is expected to be significant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
