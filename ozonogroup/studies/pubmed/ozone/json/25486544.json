Spirograms were obtained from 1494 non-asthmatic children. Air pollution data were retrieved from air monitoring stations within one kilometre of the schools. Using three-level hierarchical linear models, individual lung function was fitted to air pollution, with adjustments for demographics, indoor exposures, outdoor activity, and districts.", "Lung function changes per inter-quartile increase of the past two-months average levels of particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) and ozone (12 \u03bcg/m(3), 32-44 and 6.7 ppb, 32-38, respectively) were -103 and -142 ml on FVC, -86 and -131 on FEV1, and -102 and -188 ml/s on MMEF, respectively. Lag-1-day ozone exposure was associated with decreased MMEF. In children aged 6-10, PM2.5 was associated with decreased FEV1/FVC and MMEF/FVC ratios.", "In children aged 6-15 years, sub-chronic exposure to ambient PM2.5 and ozone leads to reduced lung capacity, whereas acute exposure to ozone decreases mid-expiratory flow.
