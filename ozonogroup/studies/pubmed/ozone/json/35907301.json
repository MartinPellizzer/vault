The fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the molecular level was explored using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Biostable finished water with an assimilable organic carbon (AOC) concentration of 30.2-45.4\u00a0\u00b5g/L was obtained by the integrated process, and the high hydraulic retention time (HRT) (\u2265\u00a045\u00a0min) of the BAC filter was necessary to provide biostable finished water. The coagulation/O<sub>3</sub>/CMF unit efficiently transformed nitrogen-containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) with aromaticity and large molecular weight (Mw) (500-1000\u00a0Da) into CHO-type highly unsaturated phenolic compounds (HuPh) with less aromaticity and medium Mw (300-500\u00a0Da), which were effectively removed by subsequent BAC filtering. The main reaction was oxygen addition, followed by deamination and dealkylation of the coagulation/O<sub>3</sub>/CMF unit and decarboxylation of the BAC filter. Principal component analysis revealed that N-containing and large-Mw PAH are potential AOC precursors, and the chemical characteristics of CHO-type and medium-Mw HuPh make them AOC candidates (correlation coefficients >\u00a00.96). This study provides insights into the management of drinking water biostability and its suitability for the practical application of the integrated coagulation/O<sub>3</sub>/CMF-BAC process in drinking water treatment plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
