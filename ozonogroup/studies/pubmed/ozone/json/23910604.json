LMMAs are mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds, which are detected at ng/L levels in water. An analytical method that allows simultaneous derivatisation and extraction of LMMAs in water has been developed using the classical static headspace technique coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS). Important parameters controlling the derivatisation of LMMAs with o-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine, oxime-products extraction and headspace generation were optimised to obtain the highest sensitivity, completing the entire process in 20min. For the first time the derivatisation reaction was carried out at alkaline pH adjusted with sodium hydrogen carbonate which exerts a significant enhancement effect on the derivatisation efficiency of the aldehydes; up to 20-fold with respect to those obtained in weak acid media as recommended by EPA Method 556.1. The addition of 200\u03bcL of n-hexane, as a chemical modifier, favoured the volatilisation of oxime-products, increasing the sensitivity of the method. The proposed method allows the achieving of detection limits from 2 to 80ng/L and has excellent precision (RSD average value of 6.4%) and accuracy (recovery ranging from 97% to 99%) for LMMA quantifications in drinking water samples. Finally, the HS-GC-MS method was validated relative to EPA Method 556.1 for the analysis of drinking water samples subjected to several disinfection treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.
