There is therefore considerable impetus to explore and develop strategies and technologies for reducing excess sludge production in biological wastewater treatment processes. This paper reviews current strategies for reducing sludge production based on these mechanisms: lysis-cryptic growth, uncoupling metabolism, maintenance metabolism, and predation on bacteria. The strategies for sludge reduction should be evaluated and chosen for practical application using costs analysis and assessment of environmental impact. High costs still limit technologies of sludge ozonation-cryptic growth and membrane bioreactor from spreading application in full-scale WWTPs. Bioacclimation and harmful to environment are major bottlenecks for chemical uncoupler in practical application. Sludge reduction induced by oligochaetes may present a cost-effective way for WWTPs if unstable worm growth is solved. Employing any strategy for reducing sludge production may have an impact on microbial community in biological wastewater treatment processes. This impact may influence the sludge characteristics and the quality of effluent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Water Pollution Control Technology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100085 Beijing, People's Republic of China. ys_wei@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yuansong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Houten", "ForeName": "Renze T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borger", "ForeName": "Arjan R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eikelboom", "ForeName": "Dick H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Yaobo", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligochaeta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}], "NumberOfReferences": "109"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14511716", "10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00441-X", "S0043-1354(03)00441-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
