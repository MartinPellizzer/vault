The nonthermal plasma-based advanced oxidation process is a promising technology for eliminating \u00b5Ps in wastewater but still needs further development in view of full-scale industrial application. A novel cascade reactor design which consists of an ozonation chamber preceding a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor with a falling water film on an activated carbon textile (Zorflex\u00ae) was used to remove a selection of \u00b5Ps from secondary municipal wastewater effluent. Compare to previous plasma reactor, molecular oxidants degraded micropollutants again in an ozonation chamber in this study, and the utilization of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) was improved. A gas flow rate of 0.4 standard liter per minute (SLM), a water flow rate of 100\u00a0mL min<sup>-1</sup>, and a discharge power of 25\u00a0W are identified as the optimal plasma reactor parameters, and the \u00b5P degradation efficiency and electrical energy per order value (EE/O) are 84-98% and 2.4-5.3\u00a0kW/m\u00b3, respectively. The presence of ROS during plasma treatment was determined in view of the \u00b5Ps removal mechanisms. The degradation of diuron (DIU), bisphenol A (BPA) and 2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (OIT) was mainly performed in ozonation chamber, while the degradation of atrazine (ATZ), alachlor (ALA) and primidone (PRD) occurred in entire cascade system. The ROS not only degrade the \u00b5Ps, but also remove nitrite (90.5%), nitrate (69.6%), ammonium (39.6%) and bulk organics (11.4%). This study provides insights and optimal settings for an energy-efficient removal of \u00b5Ps from secondary effluent using both free radicals and molecular oxidants generated by the plasma in view of full-scale application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
