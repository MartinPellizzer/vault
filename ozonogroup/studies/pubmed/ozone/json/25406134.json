The pH of ozone-treated flour decreased as exposure time increased. The L* (lightness) values of sorghum flour significantly increased (p < 0.05), while the b* (yellowness) values significantly decreased as ozone exposure time increased. Peak viscosity significantly increased as time of ozonation increased from 0 to 45 min. Results showed that gluten-free cake volume significantly increased as ozonation time increased. Additionally, longer ozonation exposure times increased cells per slice area, lightness, and slice brightness values in gluten-free cakes while reducing crumb firmness. Despite improving lightness and slice brightness values, ozonation did not significantly increase the specific volume of gluten-free batter-based bread. While ozonation improved the volume and texture in cakes, it did not have the same positive effects on gluten-free bread. Bread made from ozonated sorghum flour had an open ragged structure with equivalent volume to the control flour. In both applications, the increased brightness and lightness values due to ozone exposure is recommended to increase the acceptability of sorghum products."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Frito-Lay, Plano, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Marston", "ForeName": "Kathryn", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Processing and Technology Program, Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, KY, USA hanna.khouryieh@wku.edu."}], "LastName": "Khouryieh", "ForeName": "Hanna", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Science Institute, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA."}], "LastName": "Aramouni", "ForeName": "Fadi", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Food Sci Technol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9889534", "ISSNLinking": "1082-0132"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, Gluten-Free"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sorghum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25406134", "10.1177/1082013214559311", "1082013214559311"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
