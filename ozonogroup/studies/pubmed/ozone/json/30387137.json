Recently, media treated with CAP have also found to effectively eradicate cancer cells similar to the CAP. Based on advantages, many researchers prefer to apply CAP-activated media (PAM) as an alternative to cap in the treatment of cancer. However, less has been achieved regarding the anticancer effects and anticancer mechanisms of PAM. Investigating the selective anticancerous activities of PAM, the viability of SKBR3, MCF7, ASPC-1, A-549, G-292, and SW742 cancer cell lines, as well as normal human skin fibroblasts (FMGB-1) and MCF10A cells in relation to the media activation time, and the length of exposure was studied. Also, we examined the concentration of ozone in media as a function to CAP activation time since recent studies have proposed ozone as a pivotal reactive species in the induction of cell death. Based on the result, both increasing the duration of media activation time and the length of exposure to PAM could significantly increase the anticancer activity. Nevertheless, the cytotoxicity on normal cells was either not affected or slightly increased. Among the six tested cancer cell lines, SW742 was the most resistant and SKBR3 the most susceptible cancer cell lines to PAM. Also, increasing duration of treatment with CAP resulted in a significant rise in O<sub>3</sub> concentration levels in media. Overall, these results suggest PAM, as a promising tool in the treatment of different cancers and O <sub>3</sub> formation as a probable underlying mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tasnim Biotechnology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Etemadzadeh Ave., West Fatemi, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Recombinant Proteins Department, Breast Cancer Research Center, Motamed Cancer Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mokhtari", "ForeName": "Hesam", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Recombinant Proteins Department, Breast Cancer Research Center, Motamed Cancer Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farahmand", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of physics, Karaj branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yaserian", "ForeName": "Kiomars", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Recombinant Proteins Department, Breast Cancer Research Center, Motamed Cancer Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jalili", "ForeName": "Neda", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tasnim Biotechnology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Etemadzadeh Ave., West Fatemi, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Recombinant Proteins Department, Breast Cancer Research Center, Motamed Cancer Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8811-0997"], "LastName": "Majidzadeh-A", "ForeName": "Keivan", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30387137", "10.1002/jcp.27428"]}}]}
