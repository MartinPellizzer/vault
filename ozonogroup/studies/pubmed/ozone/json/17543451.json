The method was based on monitoring of the concentration of phenol during 90min exposure to ozonation, sonication, UV photolysis, O(3)/ultrasound, UV/ultrasound and O(3)/UV/ultrasound operations. It was found that ozonation at alkaline pH was an effective method of phenol destruction, but it was considerably more effective when applied simultaneously with ultrasonic irradiation. The observed synergy particularly at alkaline pH was attributed to combined effects of: (i) increased ozone mass transfer (upon hydrodynamic shear forces created by ultrasonic bubbles) and (ii) excess hydroxyl radical formation (upon thermal decomposition of ozone in the gaseous cavity bubbles). Degradation of phenol by photolysis alone was negligible, while combination of UV-irradiation and ultrasound rendered considerable degrees of decay. The synergy here was explained by excess hydroxyl radicals that are formed by photolysis of ultrasound-generated H(2)O(2). Maximum rate of phenol degradation was observed in case of combined application of ozone, UV and ultrasound at basic pH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bogazici University, Institute of Environmental Sciences, Bebek, 34342, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kidak", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ince", "ForeName": "N H", "Initials": "NH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "339NCG44TV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17543451", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.04.106", "S0304-3894(07)00557-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
