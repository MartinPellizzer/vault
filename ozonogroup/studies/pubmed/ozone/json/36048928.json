In this study, high concentrations of OH radicals were found when people were exposed to ozone in a climate-controlled chamber. OH concentrations calculated by two methods using measurements of total OH reactivity, speciated alkenes, and oxidation products were consistent with those obtained from a chemically explicit model. Key to establishing this human-induced oxidation field is 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), which forms when ozone reacts with the skin-oil squalene and subsequently generates OH efficiently through gas-phase reaction with ozone. A dynamic model was used to show the spatial extent of the human-generated OH oxidation field and its dependency on ozone influx through ventilation. This finding has implications for the oxidation, lifetime, and perception of chemicals indoors and, ultimately, human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2721-5362"],
