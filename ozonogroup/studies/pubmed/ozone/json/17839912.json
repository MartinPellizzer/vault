On the other hand, the upper troposphere is relatively rich in O(3) and NOx from natural sources such as downward transport from the stratosphere and lightning; convective overturning conveys the O(3) and NOx toward the Earth's surface where these components are more efficiently removed from the atmosphere. Simulations with a three-dimensional global model suggest that the net result of these counteractive processes is a 20 percent overall reduction in total tropospheric O(3). However, the net atmospheric oxidation efficiency is enhanced by 10 to 20 percent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lelieveld", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crutzen", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17839912", "10.1126/science.264.5166.1759", "264/5166/1759"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
