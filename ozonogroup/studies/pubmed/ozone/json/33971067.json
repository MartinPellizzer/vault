In this study, 55 patients were included. The patients were divided into two groups as the ozone and control group. Ozone therapy (major autohemotherapy) was applied to 37 patients who were being treated with the appropriate COVID-19 treatment protocol determined by the infectious diseases committee of our hospital. The ozone treatment protocol consisted of seven sessions (one session per day) of intravenous ozone administration, applied in a volume of 100\u00a0mL and a concentration of 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Only the conventional COVID-19 treatment protocol was applied to 18 patients in the control group. Clinical follow-up was performed until the discharge of the patients from the hospital with successful treatment or until the mortality occurred. Factors affecting mortality were analysed using univariate regression analysis.", "Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation was required in 6 of the 37 patients who were treated with ozone (16.2%), while 4 of 18 patients in the control group required ICU treatment (22.2%) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.713). When the mortality rates between the two groups were compared, mortality was lower in the ozone group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.032). As a result of univariate logistic regression analysis performed to investigate the factors affecting mortality, treatment with ozone therapy was determined as a risk factor for mortality. Patients receiving ozone therapy appear to have a lower mortality risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.149, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.026-0.863, P\u00a0=\u00a0.034).", "In this study, the findings suggested that the administration of ozone therapy along with the conventional medical treatment in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 could reduce mortality."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8192-9652"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haydarpa\u015fa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7olak", "ForeName": "\u015eahin", "Initials": "\u015e"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6693-5288"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haydarpa\u015fa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Gen\u00e7 Yavuz", "ForeName": "Burcu", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kosuyolu Rezonans Clinic, Integrative Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yavuz", "ForeName": "M\u00fcrsel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haydarpa\u015fa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6z\u00e7elik", "ForeName": "Burak", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2865-9822"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haydarpa\u015fa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6ner", "ForeName": "Metin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4307-9604"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zg\u00fcltekin", "ForeName": "Asu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4983-6613"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u015eenbayrak", "ForeName": "Seniha", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Int J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "9712381", "ISSNLinking": "1368-5031"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Habibzadeh P, Stoneman EK.
