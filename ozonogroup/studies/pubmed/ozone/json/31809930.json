The effects of different operational parameters were investigated to optimize the process performance. The results showed that the highest removal efficiency was reached at neutral pH, ozone\u202f=\u202f6.8\u202fmg/L, PMS\u202f=\u202f1.5\u202fmM and US power\u202f=\u202f200\u202fW. Under these conditions, 40\u202fmg/L of BTA was completely degraded within 60\u202fmin leading to the almost 85% of chemical oxygen demand removal, 75% of total organic carbon removal and 73.3% of organic nitrogen removal. Based on the scavenging tests, it was found that hydroxyl radical was the main oxidizing agent in the oxidation of BTA by PMS/ozone/US process. The inhibitive effect of anions on BTA removal was under this order NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u202f>\u202fHCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\u202f>\u202fCl<sup>-</sup>\u202f>\u202fNO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\u202f>\u202fSO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Degradation intermediates of BTA were identified and oxidation pathway was proposed. Finally, real samples of saline water, petrochemical wastewater and secondary effluent matrices were investigated for the performance of PMS/ozone/US process and it was found that 54%, 72.3% and 94.6% BTA removal efficiency were reached, respectively. PMS/ozone/US process was compared to US/peroxone (ozone\u00a0+\u00a0H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and the results showed importance of US irradiation in both systems. Accordingly, PMS/ozone/US process could be considered as an efficient and promising process for BTA degradation in various wastewaters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
