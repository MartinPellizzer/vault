Emissions from these industries affect local air quality and human health. This paper characterizes ambient levels of 77 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the region using high-precision measurements collected in summer 2010. Remarkably strong enhancements of 43 VOCs were detected, and concentrations in the industrial plumes were often similar to or even higher than levels measured in some of the world's largest cities and industrial regions. For example maximum levels of propene and <i>i</i>-pentane exceeded 100 ppbv, and 1,3-butadiene, a known carcinogen, reached 27 ppbv. Major VOC sources included propene fractionation, diluent separation and bitumen processing. Emissions of the measured VOCs increased the hydroxyl radical reactivity (<i>k</i><sub>OH</sub>), a measure of the potential to form downwind ozone, from 3.4 s<sup>-1</sup> in background air to 62 s<sup>-1</sup> in the most concentrated plumes. The plume value was comparable to polluted megacity values, and acetaldehyde, propene and 1,3-butadiene contributed over half of the plume <i>k</i><sub>OH</sub>. Based on a 13-year record (1994-2006) at the county level, the incidence of male hematopoietic cancers (leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) was higher in communities closest to the Industrial Heartland compared to neighboring counties. While a causal association between these cancers and exposure to industrial emissions cannot be confirmed, this pattern and the elevated VOC levels warrant actions to reduce emissions of known carcinogens, including benzene and 1,3-butadiene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simpson", "ForeName": "Isobel J", "Initials": "IJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marrero", "ForeName": "Josette E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Batterman", "ForeName": "Stuart", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meinardi", "ForeName": "Simone", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barletta", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Chemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blake", "ForeName": "Donald R", "Initials": "DR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES017885", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Atmos Environ (1994)", "NlmUniqueID": "9888534", "ISSNLinking": "1352-2310"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "AIHA (Alberta\u2019s Industrial Heartland Association) Industry and Organization Profiles. 2012 Jul; Available from:  www.industrialheartland.com/images/stories/industry/aiha_industry_information_july_2012.pdf."}, {"Citation": "Axelsson G, Barregard L, Holmberg E, Sallsten G.
