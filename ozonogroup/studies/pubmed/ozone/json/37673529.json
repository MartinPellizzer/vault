However, solving the deactivation of existing metal oxide catalysts was caused by oxygen-containing intermediates is challenging. Here, we successfully prepared a two-dimensional NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) catalyst via a facile co-precipitation method, which exhibited stable and highly efficient performance of ozone decomposition under harsh operating conditions (high space velocity and humidity). The NiFe-LDH catalyst with Ni/Fe\u00a0=\u00a03 and crystallization time over 5 hr (named Ni<sub>3</sub>Fe-5) exhibited the best catalytic performance, which was well beyond that of most existing manganese-based oxide catalysts. Specifically, under relative humidity of 65% and space velocity of 840 L/(g\u00b7hr), Ni<sub>3</sub>Fe-5 showed ozone conversion of 89% and 76% for 40 ppmV of O<sub>3</sub> within 6 and 168 hr at room-temperature, respectively. We demonstrated that the layered structure of NiFe-LDH played a decisive role in its outstanding catalytic performance in terms of both activity and water resistance. The LDH catalysts fundamentally avoids the deactivation caused by the occupancy of oxygen vacancies by oxygen-containing species (H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sup>-</sup>, and O<sup>2-</sup>) in manganese-based oxide. This study indicated the promising application potential of LDHs than manganese-based oxide catalysts in removal of gaseous ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
