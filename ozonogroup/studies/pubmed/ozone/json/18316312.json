Material for the study was collected from the Aspen FACE (free-air CO(2) enrichment) experiment in Rhinelander, WI, where the saplings had been exposed to four treatments: control, elevated [CO(2)] (560 ppm), elevated [O(3)] (1.5 x ambient) and their combination for five growing seasons. Wood properties of both species were altered in response to exposure to the treatments. In aspen, elevated [CO(2)] decreased uronic acids (constituents of, e.g., hemicellulose) and tended to increase stem diameter. In response to elevated [O(3)] exposure, acid-soluble lignin concentration decreased and vessel lumen diameter tended to decrease. Elevated [O(3)] increased the concentration of acetone-soluble extractives in paper birch, but tended to decrease the concentration of these compounds in aspen. In paper birch, elevated [CO(2)] decreased and elevated [O(3)] increased starch concentration. The responses of wood properties to 5 years of fumigation differed from those previously reported after 3 years of fumigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Finnish Forest Research Institute, Suonenjoki Research Unit, Suonenjoki, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kostiainen", "ForeName": "Katri", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaakinen", "ForeName": "Seija", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Warsta", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubiske", "ForeName": "Mark E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nelson", "ForeName": "Neil D", "Initials": "ND"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sober", "ForeName": "Jaak", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karnosky", "ForeName": "David F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saranp\u00e4\u00e4", "ForeName": "Pekka", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vapaavuori", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uronic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uronic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18316312", "10.1093/treephys/28.5.805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
