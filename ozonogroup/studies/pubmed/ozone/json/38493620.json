The effect of this process on the degradation, mineralisation and ecotoxicity of aqueous solutions of ampicillin, doxycycline, tylosin, and sulfathiazole was investigated. Microbiological MARA\u00ae bioassay and two in silico methods were used for the ecotoxicity assessment. Ozonation was an effective method for the degradation of the antibiotics studied and the reduction in ecotoxicity of the solutions. However, after ozonation, the solutions contained large amounts of organic products, including compounds much less susceptible to ozonation than the initial antibiotics. Structures of 14, 12, 40 and 10 degradation products for ampicillin, doxycycline, tylosin, and sulfathiazole, respectively, were proposed. It was confirmed that ozone plays a greater role than hydroxyl radicals in the degradation of these antibiotics, with the exception of TYL. The use of ozonation to obtain a high degree of mineralisation is unfavourable and it is suggested to combine ozonation with biodegradation. The pre-ozonation will cause decomposition of antibiotic pharmacophores, which significantly reduces the risk of spread of antimicrobial resistance in the active biocenosis of wastewater treatment plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
