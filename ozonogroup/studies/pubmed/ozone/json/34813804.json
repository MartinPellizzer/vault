To a large extent, the synergy affects the effectiveness of anthropogenic emission control, thereby reshaping the O<sub>3</sub>-NOx-VOC empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA) diagram. Focusing on the ozone pollution period of June 2017 in the North China Plain, we design almost 500 numerical experiments using regional air quality model Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) that revealed an interesting synergic effect, defined as the contribution of biogenic emissions to ozone concentrations concomitant with a reduction in anthropogenic emissions. A quasi-EKMA diagram is constructed to delineate the contribution of biogenic emissions to ozone concentrations, indicative of a linearly amplified or nonlinearly weakened result associated with reductions in anthropogenic VOCs or NOx emissions, respectively, illustrating the dipole characteristics of the synergic effect. The reduced ozone contribution from biogenic emissions along with NOx emission reduction can be used to represent controllable biogenically induced ozone (BIO). Both the amplified and controllable BIO are tightly linked to both local emissions and regional transport, implicative of an essential role in joint regional emission control. In regard to ozone exceedance, the role of biogenic emissions may be even more important, in that its contribution is comparable to or even larger than that of anthropogenic emissions when associated with a reduction in anthropogenic emissions, which is clearly demonstrated based on the near carbon neutrality scenario shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 126. Meanwhile, the biogenic emissions may steer the modulation of anthropogenic emissions in the change rate of MDA8 ozone concentration. Therefore, the synergic effect of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions elucidated in this study should be carefully considered in future ozone pollution control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
