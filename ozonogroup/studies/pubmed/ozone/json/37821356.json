Prioritizing the control of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a crucial step toward achieving clean air, yet its impact on NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution remains inadequately understood. Here, we examined the role of VOCs in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation by combining comprehensive field measurements conducted during the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai (from 10 October to 22 November 2018) and multiphase chemical modeling. Despite a decline in primary pollutants during the CIIE, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels increased compared to pre-CIIE and post-CIIE\u2500NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations decreased in the daytime (by -10 and -26%) while increasing in the nighttime (by 8 and 30%). Analysis of the observations and backward trajectory indicates that the diurnal variation in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was mainly attributed to local chemistry rather than meteorological conditions. Decreasing VOCs lowered the daytime NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production by reducing the hydroxyl radical level, whereas the greater VOCs reduction at night than that in the daytime increased the nitrate radical level, thereby promoting the nocturnal NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production. These results reveal the double-edged role of VOCs in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation, underscoring the need for transferring large VOC-emitting enterprises from the daytime to the nighttime, which should be considered in formulating corresponding policies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong
