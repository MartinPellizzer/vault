Inflammation and pain were noted at days 1 and 7 and 3 month intervals by estimating C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and assessing visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. At 3 months, soft tissue outcomes were noted in terms of plaque index, gingival index, and pocket depth, while crestal bone loss was noted via a radiograph.", "Mean CRP levels were significantly higher in the control group as compared to that in the case group on day 1 and day 7 follow-ups (P < 0.05). Mean VAS scores for pain were also lower in the case group as compared to the control group at all follow-ups, but the difference was significant statistically only at day 1 (P = 0.061). The plaque index was significantly lower in the case group as compared to the control group (P = 0.011) at final follow-up.
