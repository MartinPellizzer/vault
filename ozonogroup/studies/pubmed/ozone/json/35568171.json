The San Antonio Field Study (SAFS) was designed to investigate ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) production and precursors in this rapidly changing, sprawling metropolitan area. There are still many questions regarding the sources and chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban areas like San Antonio which are affected by a complex mixture of industry, traffic, biogenic sources and transported pollutants. The goal of the SAFS campaign in May 2017 was to measure inorganic trace gases, VOCs, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>). The SAFS field design included two sites to better assess air quality across the metro area: an urban site (Traveler's World; TW) and a downwind/suburban site (University of Texas at San Antonio; UTSA). The results indicated that acetone (2.52 \u00b1 1.17 and 2.39 \u00b1 1.27 ppbv), acetaldehyde (1.45 \u00b1 1.02 and 0.93 \u00b1 0.45 ppbv) and isoprene (0.64 \u00b1 0.49 and 1.21 \u00b1 0.85 ppbv; TW and UTSA, respectively) were the VOCs with the highest concentrations. Additionally, positive matrix factorization showed three dominant factors of VOC emissions: biogenic, aged urban mixed source, and acetone. Methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein (MVK + MACR) exhibited contributions from both secondary photooxidation of isoprene and direct emissions from traffic. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>:CH<sub>4</sub> demonstrated potential influence of oil and gas activities in San Antonio. Moreover, the high O<sub>3</sub> days during the campaign were in the NO<sub>x</sub>-limited O<sub>3</sub> formation regime and were preceded by evening peaks in select VOCs, NO<sub>x</sub> and CO. Overall, quantification of the concentration and trends of VOCs and trace gases in a major city in Texas offers vital information for general air quality management and supports strategies for reducing O<sub>3</sub> pollution. The SAFS campaign VOC results will also add to the growing body of literature on urban sources and concentrations of VOCs in major urban areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
