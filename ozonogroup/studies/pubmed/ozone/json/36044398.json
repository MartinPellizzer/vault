To date, the thermal annealing (TA) process is still an essential step for a high-quality SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL to reduce the surface trap density. This however could restrict its processing with high thermal energy input and set a barrier to the easiness of manufacturing such as processing under room-temperature conditions. Herein, we report a thermal annealing-free (TAF) SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL by an alternative UV-ozone (UVO) treatment. This technique simultaneously endows the SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL with a deeper valence band maximum (<i>E</i><sub>VB</sub>) and lower defect density. Furthermore, with this SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.46 and 22.26% was achieved based on MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and Cs<sub>0.05</sub>(FA<sub>0.85</sub>MA<sub>0.15</sub>)<sub>0.95</sub>Pb(I<sub>0.85</sub>Br<sub>0.15</sub>)<sub>3</sub> absorbers, respectively. Importantly, a fully room-temperature-processed (RTP) PSC based on the TAF-SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL has been demonstrated with a PCE of 20.88% on a rigid substrate and 15.92% on a flexible substrate, which are the highest values for RTP solar cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3593-4327"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Materials &
