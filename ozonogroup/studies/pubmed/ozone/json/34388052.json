Three different products were used, each one representing a different structure and mycotoxin distribution: (1) wheat grains, with natural mycotoxin distribution inside and among the grains; (2) homemade pellets, with homogenous mycotoxin distribution; (3) ground homemade pellets, with homogeneous mycotoxin distribution, and smaller particles. The ozonation of naturally contaminated wheat grains did not reduce the concentrations of DON and ZEN. When the variability of contamination among replicates was reduced by the production of homemade pellets showed, the ozonation provides a reduction of 14% of ZEN concentration. Reducing the size of particles by grinding the homemade pellets, a reduction of DON (11%) and ZEN (31%) was observed, which was evidenced by the higher ozone consumption during the process. Therefore, some limitations of ozonation of grains and particulate products, such as particle dimensions and distribution of natural contamination of mycotoxins affect the degradation of DON and ZEN under real conditions. Because of this, further studies to evaluate the effectiveness of ozonation should also be performed in samples naturally contaminated to produce robustness results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4743-002X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), \"Luiz de Queiroz\" College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Romero", "ForeName": "Alessandra de C\u00e1ssia", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6494-093X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), \"Luiz de Queiroz\" College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Morais", "ForeName": "Jo\u00e3o Bruno de Almeida", "Initials": "JBA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7435-343X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), \"Luiz de Queiroz\" College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Augusto", "ForeName": "Pedro Esteves Duarte", "Initials": "PED"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2764-4706"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), \"Luiz de Queiroz\" College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Calori-Domingues", "ForeName": "Maria Antonia", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichothecenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W827M159J", "NameOfSubstance": "Zearalenone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trichothecenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zearalenone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34388052", "10.1080/03601234.2021.1962168"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
