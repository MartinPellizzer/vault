Radiotelemetry techniques were used to monitor core body temperature continuously. Following exposure to a 20 cGy dose of X-rays, the mice displayed a rapid and significant reduction in core body temperature relative to the sham-treated (non-irradiated) control animals. The present studies, and those by others, showed that pre-exposure to X-rays at doses as low as 20 cGy may result in a reduced mortality rate following subsequent exposure to X-rays at mid-lethal dose levels. This indicates an increased tolerance to radiation. An additional experiment was conducted to examine whether the reduction in the mortality rate following exposure to mid-lethal doses of radiation could be found when mice were subjected to a stressor, ozone inhalation, which induced a suppression in body temperature. The results showed that following inhalation of ozone at a concentration of 0.5 ppm, 93% of the treated animals survived a mid-lethal dose of radiation, whereas 50% of the sham-control animals died within 30 days. These results suggest that low-dose-induced tolerance to radiation may be dependent on a brief exposure to ozone, and a reduction in core temperature may be necessary to obtain tolerance effects in response to a mid-lethal dose of radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Toho University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyachi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Radiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0373125", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1285"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothermia, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10817047", "10.1259/bjr.73.867.10817047"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
