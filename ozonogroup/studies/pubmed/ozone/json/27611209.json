Previously, we described a system in which CH<sub>3</sub>Br fumes vented from fumigation chambers could be captured by granular activated carbon (GAC). The GAC was converted to a cathode by submergence in a high ionic strength solution and connection to the electrical grid, resulting in reductive debromination of the sorbed CH<sub>3</sub>Br. The GAC bed was drained and dried for reuse to capture and destroy CH<sub>3</sub>Br fumes from the next fumigation. However, the loose GAC particles and slow kinetics of this primitive electrode necessitated improvements. Here, we report the development of a cathode containing a thin layer of small GAC particles coating carbon cloth as a current distributor. Combining the high sorption potential of GAC for CH<sub>3</sub>Br with the conductivity of the carbon cloth current distributor, the cathode significantly lowered the total cell resistance and achieved 96% reductive debromination of CH<sub>3</sub>Br sorbed at 30% by weight to the GAC within 15 h at -1 V applied potential vs standard hydrogen electrode, a time scale and efficiency suitable for postharvest fumigations. The cathode exhibited stable performance over 50 CH<sub>3</sub>Br capture and destruction cycles. Initial cost estimates indicate that this technique could treat CH<sub>3</sub>Br fumes at \u223c$5/kg, roughly one-third of the cost of current alternatives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuanqing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University , McCullough Building, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University , McCullough Building, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Research Service, San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center, USDA , 9611 South Riverbend Avenue, Parlier, California 93648-9757, United States."}], "LastName": "Walse", "ForeName": "Spencer S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Giannini Hall, University of California at Berkeley , Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Olver", "ForeName": "Ryan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Giannini Hall, University of California at Berkeley , Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Zilberman", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Mitch", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27611209", "10.1021/acs.est.6b03489"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
