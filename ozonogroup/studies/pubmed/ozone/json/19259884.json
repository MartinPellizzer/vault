Iodomethane is of interest because it is a volatile liquid pre-plant soil crop protection fumigant that has been proposed as a non-ozone-depleting alternative to methyl bromide. Serum was prepared from whole blood collected on wet ice at the time of sacrifice and kept frozen at less than -65 degrees C. For analysis, serum samples were thawed unassisted at ambient temperature. Proteins were separated from the serum samples by ultrafiltration. A 100-microl filtered serum sample was then injected into the ion chromatograph without additional sample preparation. Iodide was separated in <20 min by anion-exchange chromatography using a 25-mM nitric acid eluent. The analyte of interest was detected by pulsed amperometry using a silver working electrode. The method showed linear response over the concentration range of 100 to 5000 ng/ml iodide (r2>.998) with a lower limit of quantitation of 100 ng/ml iodide. The accuracy of the procedure, determined by spiked recovery measurements at 100 ng/ml iodide, was between 90 and 110%. A method detection limit of 20 ng/ml for iodide in serum samples was demonstrated using the method of standard additions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MPI Research, Inc., State College, Pennsylvania 16801, USA. edward_kaiser@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaiser", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shaffer", "ForeName": "Lydia", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flaherty", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rohrer", "ForeName": "Jeffrey S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Himmelstein", "ForeName": "Matthew W", "Initials": "MW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Iodinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DAT010ZJSR", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl iodide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Iodinated"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Iodides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19259884", "10.1080/08958370802597528", "909222481"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
