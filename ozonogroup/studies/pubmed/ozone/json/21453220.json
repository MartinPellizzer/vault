The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ozone, with or without the use of desensitizing agents, on patency and occlusion of simulated hypersensitive dentin.", "Sixty standardized dentin slabs were randomly divided into six groups: distilled water (Control), ozone treatment, fluoride desensitizer (ALLSolutions, Dentsply), oxalate desensitizer (D/Sense Crystal, Centrix), combined use of ozone/fluoride and combined use of ozone/oxalate. Ozone gas was delivered from OzonyTronX (Mymed). Specimens were evaluated using a scanning electron microscope and digital image analysis before and after treatment.", "Statistical analysis using ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U-tests revealed significantly lower percentage of tubular occlusion with ozone treatment than distilled water at p \u2264 0.05. Scanning electron microscope photomicrographs of oxalate desensitizer specimens revealed a thick homogenous precipitate with significantly higher percentage of tubular occlusion than fluoride desensitizer and distilled water. Combined use of ozone/fluoride resulted in a significantly higher percentage of tubular occlusion than fluoride desensitizer alone. However, no significant difference was found between oxalate desensitizer and combined use of ozone/oxalate.", "The use of ozone gas is a viable adjunct to fluoride-containing desensitizers in enhancing tubular occlusion, but is not effective with oxalate desensitizers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative Dentistry, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raafat Abdelaziz", "ForeName": "Rasha", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mosallam", "ForeName": "Rania Sayed", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousry", "ForeName": "Mai Mahmoud", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Sweden", "MedlineTA": "Acta Odontol Scand", "NlmUniqueID": "0370344", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6357"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "AllSolutions Fluoride Varnish"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dentin Desensitizing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides, Topical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Precipitation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin Desensitizing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin Sensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxalates"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21453220", "10.3109/00016357.2011.572290"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
