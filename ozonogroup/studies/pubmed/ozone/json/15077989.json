The process divided effluent into two streams. Both streams were subjected to anaerobic dye-cleavage, aerobic mineralization of cleavage-products and biomass separation. One stream was also membrane filtered and treated with ozone, which made possible the recycling of 60% of the total discharge. By these means it was possible to increase the quality of the treated streams for recycling purposes, as well as the dye capacity of the textile mill, and to minimize the operating costs. Furthermore, the municipal wastewater treatment plant into which the textile finishing mill's water is discharged, did not need to enhance its capacity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemical Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Gaussstrasse 17, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany. r.krull@tu-bs.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krull", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00f6pkens", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Aerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Anaerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15077989"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
