The feasibility and efficiency of a CBW treatment process combining ozonation as pre- and post-treatment of a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSFCW) was assessed. Over an extended monitoring period of 390 days, two lab-scale HSFCW units were tested; one planted with P.\u00a0australis (CWP) and one unplanted-control (CWC) operated at average organic loads rates (OLR) of 5 and 10\u00a0g COD/m<sup>2</sup>/d. CWP always outperformed the control unit. The ozonation trials were run at pH values of 8.15-8.21 and 5.39-5.45 (without adjustment) at ozone to COD ratios of 0.25-0.29 and 0.24-0.59 when implemented as pre- and post-treatment, respectively. Average removals (calculated through mass balance basis) were 78-88%, 86-91%, 71-89% and 43-89% for COD, BOD<sub>5</sub>, Total Phenols (TPh) and colour when ozonation was implemented as post-treatment. For ozonation as pre-treatment, respective figures were 77-80%, 79-92%, 78-85% and 19-73%. Regardless of the treatment scheme and OLR, ozonation was very effective in biodegradability increase (i.e., BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD) from 0.18 to 0.42 when applied as pre-treatment, and decolourization after the HSFCW increased from 21% to 91% (post-treatment) with respective ozone consumed yields of 67-69% and 72-85%. The best results were obtained for the scheme CWP\u00a0+\u00a0Ozonation at OLR of 5.33\u00a0g COD/m<sup>2</sup>/d with COD reductions from 1950\u00a0mg/L to 81-88\u00a0mg/L in the effluent and TPh from 125\u00a0mg/L to 5-6\u00a0mg/L at limited ozone amounts of 0.21-0.45\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>/d."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
