Despite extensive investigations into COA's model compounds like oleic acid, the intricacies of heterogeneous ozonolysis of real COA and the effects of ambient conditions like humidity remain elusive. In this work, the ozonolysis of COA proxies from heated peanut oil emissions was investigated using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) spectroscopy, and proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). We found that humidity hinders the reaction between ozone and CC double bonds due to the competitive adsorption of water and ozone on COA. Although visible light has little influence on the ozonolysis of COA in the absence of humidity, the ozonolytic CO production is significantly promoted by visible light in the presence of humidity. It may be attributed to the formation of water-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS, mainly HO<sup>\u2022</sup>) from the photosensitization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in COA. We also found that humidity can enhance the depolymerization of carboxylic acid dimers and hydrolysis of intrinsic acetals in the COA. Moreover, humidity promotes the release of VOCs during both the dark and light ozonolysis of COA. This work reveals the important roles of humidity-responsive and photo-responsive components in COA during its ozonolysis, and the change in VOC release may guide the control of human VOC exposure in indoor air."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
