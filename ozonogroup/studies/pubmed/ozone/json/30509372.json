We studied risk of ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) within hours of exposure to air pollution while adjusting for weather.", "We performed a case-crossover study of STEMI cases in Stockholm, Sweden (Jan 2000-June 2014) based on SWEDEHEART. Exposures during hazard periods up to 24\u202fh prior to admission were compared to bidirectionally sampled control periods. Risks attributable to sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone and particulate pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>) were studied in conditional logistic regression models for interquartile range increments.", "Risk of STEMI (n\u202f=\u202f14,601) was associated with NO<sub>2</sub> (strongest at 15-h lag) and with PM<sub>2.5</sub> (strongest at 20-h lag), in single-pollutant models adjusting for air temperature and humidity (NO<sub>2</sub>: odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval) 1.065 (1.031-1.101); PM<sub>2.5</sub>: 1.026 (1.001-1.054)). After adjusting models for atmospheric pressure (significantly associated with STEMI risk at 14-24-h lags), NO<sub>2</sub> remained highly statistically significant (1.057 (1.022-1.094)) but not PM<sub>2.5</sub> (1.024 (0.997-1.052)). No associations were seen for SO<sub>2</sub>, ozone or PM<sub>10</sub>.", "Risk of STEMI rises within hours of exposure to air pollutants, with strongest impact of NO<sub>2</sub>.
