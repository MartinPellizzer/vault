Potentially carcinogenic bromate is a DBP formed during the ozonation of bromide-containing waters. To mitigate the problem of bromate formation, different physical/chemical or biological reduction methods of bromate have been investigated. Until now, adsorption-based physical method has proven to be more effective than chemical methods in potable water treatment. Though several studies on biological reduction methods have been carried out in a variety of bioreactor systems, such as in biologically active carbon filters and denitrifying bioreactors, the microbiological mechanisms or biochemical pathways of bromate minimization have not been clearly determined to date. Genetic analysis could provide a broader picture of microorganisms involved in bromate reduction which might show cometabolic or respiratory pathways, and affirm the synergy functions between different contributing groups. The hypothesis established from the diffusion coefficients of different electron donor and acceptors, illustrates that some microorganisms preferring bromate over oxygen contain specific enzymes which lower the activation energy required for bromate reduction. In addition, considering microbial bromate reduction as an effective treatment strategy; field scale investigations are required to observe quantitative correlations of various influencing parameters such as pH, ozone dose, additives or constituents such as ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and/or chloramine, dissolved organic carbon levels, dissolved oxygen gradient within biofilm, and empty bed contact time on bromate removal or reduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
