However, a detailed chemical mechanism is still lacking. Herein, we explored the chemistry of the N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X<sup>-</sup> systems at the air-water interface. Two different reaction pathways were identified for the reaction of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with X<sup>-</sup> at the air-water interface: the formation of XNO<sub>2</sub> or XONO, along with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. In the case of the Cl<sup>-</sup> system, the ClNO<sub>2</sub> generation pathway is more favorable, while for the Br<sup>-</sup> and I<sup>-</sup> systems, the formation of BrONO and IONO is barrierless, making them the predominant products. Furthermore, the mechanisms of formation of X<sub>2</sub> from XNO<sub>2</sub> and XONO were also investigated. The high energy barriers of reactions and the high free energies of the products compared to those of the reactants indicate that ClNO<sub>2</sub> is stable at the air-water interface. Contrary to the widely held belief regarding X<sub>2</sub> producing from the reaction of XNO<sub>2</sub> with X<sup>-</sup>, our calculations demonstrate that BrONO and IONO initially form stable BrONO\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br<sup>-</sup> and IONO\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I<sup>-</sup> complexes, which then subsequently react with Br<sup>-</sup> and I<sup>-</sup> to form Br<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, respectively. Finally, Br<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> decompose to form Br<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2.</sub> These findings have significant implications for experimental interpretation and offer new insights into halogen cycling in the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1768-0191"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Nanoscience, CAS Key Laboratory of Nanosystem and Hierarchical Fabrication, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Ye-Guang", "Initials": "YG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5461-1486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8316-1816"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chongqin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1668-465X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Wei-Hai", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39074151", "10.1021/jacs.4c05850"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
