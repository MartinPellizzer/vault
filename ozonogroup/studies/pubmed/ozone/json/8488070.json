There is little doubt that cumulative exposure to UV radiation is important in the aetiology of non-melanoma skin cancers. Evidence is also strong for a link with cutaneous malignant melanoma, although here it appears to be intermittent intense exposure that is most damaging. More controversial is the view that exposure to solar radiation is a significant factor in ocular damage, particularly in the formation of cataracts. Earlier studies pointing to such an effect have been criticized and alternative aetiological hypotheses have been proposed. However, other studies do show an effect of UV exposure on cortical cataract. Concern is also growing that UV may be capable of activating viruses and have immunological effects that might exacerbate infectious disease. Very worrying is the possibility that UV exposure can activate the human immunodeficiency virus which might accelerate the onset AIDS. Any such health effects that have been observed in human populations are the result of exposure to existing, naturally occurring levels of UV radiation. There is, therefore, great concern about the possible exacerbation of these impacts as a result of increased exposure to UV radiation associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. However, any assessment of the nature and scale of such impacts on human health has to deal with several major problems and these are the focus of this paper. There are uncertainties about recent trends in stratospheric ozone and problems in the prediction of future changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, UEA/UCL, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bentham", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Parasitology", "NlmUniqueID": "0401121", "ISSNLinking": "0031-1820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cataract"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}], "NumberOfReferences": "45"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8488070", "10.1017/s0031182000086108"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
