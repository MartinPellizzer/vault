Each PRCL was classified in terms of color, cavitation, size, hardness, distance from the gingival margin and severity. Overlying plaque was then removed and each lesion dried. A biopsy was taken from half of each PRCL using a sterile excavator. Subsequently, the remaining lesions were exposed to ozone gas for a period of either 10 seconds (n = 35) or 20 seconds (n = 35) and a further biopsy was taken.", "Using a paired Student t-test, a significant (P < 0.001) difference (mean +/- SE) in total micro-organisms was observed in the ozone-treated samples after either a 10 seconds (log10 4.35 +/- 0.49) or 20 seconds (log10 0.46 +/- 0.26) ozone application compared with the control samples (log10 7.00 +/- 0.24) and (log10 6.00 +/- 0.21) respectively. Using Pearson's correlation tests, there were significant correlations for the reduction in total micro-organisms after 10 seconds of ozone application with cavitation, size, distance from gingival margin and severity of PRCLs (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ozone application either for 10 or 20 seconds dramatically reduced most of the micro-organisms in PRCLs without any side effects recorded at recall intervals between 3 and 5.5 months. Out of the 65 PRCLs reviewed, 33 lesions had become hard, 27 lesions reversed to severity index 1 from severity index 2, and five lesions remained the same following ozone application for a period of either 10 or 20 seconds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The School of Dentistry, University of Birmingham, St Chad's Queensway, Birmingham B4 6NN, UK. a.baysan@bham.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baysan", "ForeName": "Aylin", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8806701", "ISSNLinking": "0894-8275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Anaerobic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Root Caries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics, Nonparametric"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15241911"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
