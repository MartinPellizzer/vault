Our simulation on June-2019 indicated that Beijing local emissions produced O<sub>3</sub> at the rate of 0.7-9.2\u00a0ppb/h and led to an O<sub>3</sub> increase of 48.9\u00a0ppb during 05:00-18:00, accounting for 68.3% of the observed O<sub>3</sub> increase. The maximum level and production rate of simulated O<sub>3</sub> showed a linear response to VOCs, therefore we can use VOCs levels in urban plumes to quantify O<sub>3</sub> formation in summer. The IR (g O<sub>3</sub> formed per g VOCs) was calculated on the actual precursor and meteorology condition of this megacity, 0.12-4.90\u00a0g/g for individual VOCs and 1.49\u00a0g/g for comprehensive TVOCs. The weighted average of individual IRs agreed well with that of TVOCs, but these IRs were 34.5% of MIR values that were widely used in references. It's noteworthy that these IRs had greater sensitivity to precursor levels, and broadly remained stable under the fixed VOCs:NOx. Considering the synchronous reductions of precursors in Beijing, we applied these IRs to quantify chemical O<sub>3</sub> evolution from Beijing local emissions in summer of recent years, declining from 63.5\u00a0ppb in 2016 to 44.0\u00a0ppb in 2020 for June. The contributions of the diagnosed chemical O<sub>3</sub> to Beijing O<sub>3</sub> better matched with the atmospheric transport paths on daily basis, higher than 100% when the transport paths starting from the clean neighbor cities, but lower to 45%-66% when the transport paths originating from the highly-polluted neighbor cities. This consistence indicated the reliability of our IR calculation method for quickly estimating chemical O<sub>3</sub> production of urban plumes in summer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
