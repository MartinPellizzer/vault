The present study constructed functionalized microbubbles, named colloidal ozone aphrons (COAs), by dissolving ozone-contained air into the nonionic surfactant (Tween-20) solution at the pressure of 300\u202fkPa for the in situ remediation of phenanthrene (PHE)-contaminated sediments. The COA system aimed at improving the PHE elimination in terms of (i) enhancing the migration and transportation ability of the bubble system in the contaminated aquifer matrix, (ii) accurately desorbing the target hydrophobic contaminants from sediments, and (iii) reinforcing the in situ oxidation degradation immediately after or simultaneously when the PAHs are desorbed into the aqueous phase. Experimental results demonstrated that the COAs exhibited similar characteristics as the classical colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs), including the high stability (half-life time\u202f>\u202f200\u202fs), typical morphology and average bubble size (114-162\u202f\u03bcm); higher air hold-up of COAs was achieved (i. e. > 20%) compared with the air-microbubbles (1-2%) obtained under the same generation conditions. Although the encapsulated ozone could oxidize the surfactant-layers, the properties and behaviors of COAs were not greatly affected. The surfactant multi-layers endowed the COAs with strong hydrophobic attraction with PHE, great migration capacity and enlarged oxidation area in the sediment matrix. Approximately 96.9% of PHE was removed from the sediments and 84.9% of the overall PHE was oxidized at the high ozone concentration of 0.6\u202fmg/L when the initial PHE concentration was 240.0\u202f\u03bcg/kg. The COA-involved remediation technology provided the insight of combining the processes of washing and oxidizing through adopting the particularly conceived microbubbles. The in situ and selective removal of hydrophobic organic contaminants from sediments in aquifer was well achieved in this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
