Results indicate that Ce-MCM-48, especially with a Si/Ce molar ratio of 66 (i.e., Ce66-MCM-48), could significantly inhibit bromate (BrO3(-)) formation during ozonation of Br(-)-containing water, achieving 91% of inhibition efficiency at pH 7.6 and 25 \u00b0C. An acidic or alkaline pH decreased the inhibition efficiency of Ce66-MCM-48 to some extent, but reaction temperature ranging from 15 to 30 \u00b0C had no significant impact. By comparing the bromine mass balance, aqueous O3 decomposition, and newly formed H2O2 between O3 and O3/Ce66-MCM-48 processes, the inhibition mechanism was proposed: Ce66-MCM-48 promoted aqueous O3 decomposition to generate hydroxyl radicals (OH) that could merge into H2O2, so the oxidative transformation of Br(-) and HOBr/OBr(-) by O3 and OH was primarily suppressed. The catalytic ability of Ce66-MCM-48 was continuously regenerated through the circulating reactions between Ce(III) and Ce(IV) occurring on the catalyst surface. Besides its inhibition on BrO3(-) formation, Ce66-MCM-48 could also enhance the degradation of refractory organic micropollutants. Because of these distinct merits, Ce66-MCM-48 has potential applications to water treatment by ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
