The aim of this study was to assess airway and systemic inflammatory responses in older healthy subjects to a controlled experimental exposure with spark-generated elemental carbon black ultrafine particles (cbUFPs) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Twenty healthy subjects, age 52-75\u00a0years, were exposed on three occasions separated by at least 8\u00a0weeks. The exposures to filtered air (FA), to cbUFP (50\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), or to cbUFP in combination with 250\u00a0ppb ozone (cbUFP\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>) for 3\u00a0h with intermittent exercise were performed double blind, and in random order. Sputum and blood samples were collected 3.5\u00a0h after each exposure. Exposure to cbUFP\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased plasma club cell protein 16 (CC16), the number of sputum cells, the number and percent of sputum neutrophils, and sputum interleukin 6 and matrix metalloproteinase 9. Exposure to cbUFP alone exerted no marked effect, except for an elevation in sputum neutrophils in a subgroup of 13 subjects that displayed less than 65% sputum neutrophils after FA exposure. None of the inflammatory markers was correlated with age, and serum cardiovascular risk markers were not markedly affected by cbUFP or cbUFP\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. Exposure to cbUFP+O<sub>3</sub> induced a significant airway and systemic inflammatory response in older healthy volunteer subjects. The effects induced by cbUFP alone suggest that the inflammation was predominantly mediated by O<sub>3</sub>, although one cannot rule out that the interaction of cbUFP and O<sub>3</sub> played a role."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Clinical Airway Research , Fraunhofer ITEM , Hannover , Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Member of the German Center for Lung Research (BREATH) , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0665-7807"], "LastName": "Holz", "ForeName": "Olaf", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Hannover Medical School , Institute of Clinical Pharmacology , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heusser", "ForeName": "Karsten", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Clinical Airway Research , Fraunhofer ITEM , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "Meike", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Clinical Airway Research , Fraunhofer ITEM , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Windt", "ForeName": "Horst", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Clinical Airway Research , Fraunhofer ITEM , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwarz", "ForeName": "Katharina", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Hannover Medical School , CRC Core Facility , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schindler", "ForeName": "Christoph", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Hannover Medical School , Institute of Clinical Pharmacology , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tank", "ForeName": "Jens", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Clinical Airway Research , Fraunhofer ITEM , Hannover , Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Member of the German Center for Lung Research (BREATH) , Hannover , Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Hannover Medical School , Clinic for Respiratory Medicine , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hohlfeld", "ForeName": "Jens M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Hannover Medical School , Institute of Clinical Pharmacology , Hannover , Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jordan", "ForeName": "Jens", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sympathetic Nervous System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29693510", "10.1080/15287394.2018.1463331"]}}]}
