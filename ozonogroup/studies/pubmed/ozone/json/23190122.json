E. coli suspensions (10(7) CFU ml(-1)) in either maximum recovery diluent (MRD) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were treated in a 96-well microtitre plate inside a sealed package. The effects of treatment time, post-treatment storage time, either direct or indirect samples exposure to the plasma discharge and suspension media were studied. Regardless of the media tested, 20 s of direct and 45 s of indirect plasma treatment resulted in complete bacterial inactivation (7 log CFU ml(-1)). At the lower plasma treatment times (10-30 s) investigated, the effects of suspension media and mode of exposure on the inactivation efficacy were evident. The inactivation efficacy was also influenced by the post-treatment storage time.", "It was demonstrated that the novel DBD-ACP can inactivate high concentrations of E. coli suspended in liquids within sealed packages in seconds.", "A key advantage of this in-package nonthermal novel disinfection approach is the elimination of post-processing contamination."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Environmental Health, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin, Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ziuzina", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cullen", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keener", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bourke", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23190122", "10.1111/jam.12087"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
