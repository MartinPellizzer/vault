At the coastal research station, a sea-land breeze (SLB) circulation accompanied by a concurrent coastal low-level jets (CLLJ) structure was observed and identified during 11-12 May 2020. The sea breeze first formed at 10:00 LT on 11 May, turned to land breeze at night, and returned to sea breeze again at 10:00 LT the next morning, prevailing at altitudes of 0-0.5\u00a0km and 0-0.3\u00a0km respectively. Land breeze at night carries O<sub>3</sub> from the inland to the sea forming high ozone levels over the sea, and the shift of the sea breeze during daytime further blew pollution back to the land. Additionally, the conversion of SLB contributed to the occurrence of CLLJ at the altitudes of ~0.3-0.7\u00a0km by 02:00 and 06:00 LT, of which the center of wind speed reached ~13\u00a0m\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. The CLLJ-induced turbulent activity decoupled the residual layer (RL) and stable boundary layer, leading to a reduction of RL-O<sub>3</sub> levels and an increase of ~50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> in surface-O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The YRD's unique coastal characteristics make O<sub>3</sub> pollution causes in coastal areas more complicated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
