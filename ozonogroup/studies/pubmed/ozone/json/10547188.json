Measurements of PLHP, which are primary oxidation products, may reflect an early susceptibility of the target cell to oxidative stress. Biphasic cultures of bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were exposed to ozone at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1-1.0 ppm) for 4 and 12 h. Detection of PLHP was made using a novel technique based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in combination with high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Six phospholipids were identified on the HPTLC plate; lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). From the FTIR spectra, O-O stretching of hydroperoxides was identified in the range 890-820cm(-1). Multivariate data analysis revealed a positive correlation (r = 0.99 for 4 h exposure and r = 0.98 for 12h exposure) between ozone exposure levels and the region of the FTIR-spectrum comprising the main wavelengths for hydroperoxides. These data support this alternative, versatile and novel spectroscopic approach for the early detection of ozone-mediated damage in human airway epithelial cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lung Injury and Inflammation Research Group, Department of Respiratory Medicine, North Staffordshire Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, England. med06@cc.keele.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hemmingsen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortensen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spiteri", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10547188", "10.1080/10715769900301001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
