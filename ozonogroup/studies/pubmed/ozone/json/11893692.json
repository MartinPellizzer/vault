This syndrome has been associated with a myriad of mediators including cytokines, oxidants, and growth factors. To better understand gene-environmental interactions controlling this complex process, the sensitivity of inbred mouse strains was investigated following acute lung injury that was induced by fine nickel sulfate aerosol. Measuring survival time, protein and neutrophil concentrations in BAL fluid, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and histology, we found that these responses varied between inbred mouse strains and that susceptibility is heritable. To assess the progression of acute lung injury, the temporal expression of genes and expressed sequence tags was assessed by complementary DNA microarray analysis. Enhanced expression was noted in genes that were associated with oxidative stress, antiprotease function, and extracellular matrix repair. In contrast, expression levels of surfactant proteins (SPs) and Clara cell secretory protein (ie, transcripts that are constitutively expressed in the lung) decreased markedly. Genome-wide analysis was performed with offspring derived from a sensitive and resistant strain (C57BL/6xA F(1) backcrossed with susceptible A strain). Significant linkage was identified for a locus on chromosome 6 (proposed as Aliq4), a region that we had identified previously following ozone-induced acute lung injury. Two suggestive linkages were identified on chromosomes 1 and 12. Using haplotype analysis to estimate the combined effect of these regions (along with putative modifying loci on chromosomes 9 and 16), we found that five loci interact to account for the differences in survival time of the parental strains. Candidate genes contained in Aliq4 include SP-B, aquaporin 1, and transforming growth factor-alpha. Thus, the functional genomic approaches of large gene set expression (complementary DNA microarray) and genome-wide analyses continue to provide novel insights into the genetic susceptibility of lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0056, USA. leikaugd@uc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leikauf", "ForeName": "George D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDowell", "ForeName": "Susan A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wesselkamper", "ForeName": "Scott C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hardie", "ForeName": "William D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leikauf", "ForeName": "John E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korfhagen", "ForeName": "Thomas R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prows", "ForeName": "Daniel R", "Initials": "DR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES06096", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES10562", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL65612", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL65613", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chest", "NlmUniqueID": "0231335", "ISSNLinking": "0012-3692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aqp1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aquaporins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteolipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "146410-94-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Aquaporin 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4FLT4T3WUN", "NameOfSubstance": "nickel sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-84-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polytetrafluoroethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aquaporin 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aquaporins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Linkage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Transgenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polytetrafluoroethylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Proteolipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Trait, Heritable"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11893692", "10.1378/chest.121.3_suppl.70s", "S0012-3692(15)35471-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
