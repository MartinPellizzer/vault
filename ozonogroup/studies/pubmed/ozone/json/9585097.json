Whether such exposure affected the normal function of pulmonary surfactant of maintaining airway patency was evaluated with a capillary surfactometer. Respiratory rate in mice that were not exposed was 358+/-16 (mean+/-S.E.) breaths/min and decreased to 202+/-10 after 6 h exposure. The mean pressure change caused by breathing diminished significantly, indicating a reduced tidal volume. BAL fluid from controls maintained patency for 88+/-2% of the study time, 120 s, implying a good surfactant function, but the ozone exposure caused the surfactant to lose its capability of maintaining patency (P < 0.0001). This decaying surfactant function of the BAL fluid coincided with an increasing protein concentration in the fluid of exposed animals (1.46+/-0.14 mg/ml in the 8-h group) as compared to controls (0.44+/-0.04 mg/ml, P < 0.0001). It is concluded that leakage of plasma proteins into the airway lumen was probably the main reason for the surfactant dysfunction, which may have contributed to the altered breathing pattern."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Department of Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Currie", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Schaik", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Enhorning", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL 49971", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9585097", "10.1016/s0300-483x(97)00158-3", "S0300-483X(97)00158-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
