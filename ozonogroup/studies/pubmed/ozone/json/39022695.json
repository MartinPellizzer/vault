The IoT framework consists of MQ9, MQ135, MQ131, and dust or PM sensors with an Arduino microcontroller to collect real data on sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particle matters 2.5 and 10 \u00b5m. The data is stored in an Excel file as a comma-separated file and after that, authors applied regression type and classification type machine learning algorithms to analyze the data. The dataset consists of 11 columns and 155,406 rows, where sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particle matter 2.5 and 10 are recorded where AQI is marked as the target variable and the others are indicated as independent variables. In the dataset, AQI is categorized into five classes named Good, satisfactory, Moderate, Poor and Very Poor. After experimental results, it is seen that two places including Uttara and Kuril are comparatively suitable for Air Quality among the three places as well as the Random Forest algorithm outperforms the models. The study describes details of the embedded system's hardware as well. This dataset will be beneficial for environmental researchers to use to analyze the air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Software Engineering, Daffodil International University, Daffodil Smart City (DSC), Birulia, Savar, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rising Research Lab, Sheikh Bari, Malancha, Melandah, Jamalpur- 2012, Mymensingh, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Md Monirul", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IUBAT- International University of Business Agriculture and Technology, 4 Embankment Drive Road, Sector-10, Uttara Model Town, Dhaka 1230, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Jibon", "ForeName": "Ferdaus Anam", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of Bangladesh, South Purbachal, Kanchan, Dhaka 1461, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Tarek", "ForeName": "M Masud", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of Bangladesh, South Purbachal, Kanchan, Dhaka 1461, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Kanchan", "ForeName": "Muntasir Hasan", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Software Engineering, Daffodil International University, Daffodil Smart City (DSC), Birulia, Savar, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Perbhez Shakil", "ForeName": "Shalah Uddin", "Initials": "SU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Shakil S.U.P., Kashem M.A., Islam M.M., Nayan N.M., Uddin J.
