Effluent samples displayed rapid initial ozone demand, which promotes ozone transfer but diminishes disinfection efficacy. Ozone doses up to 10 mg/L yielded only trace quantities of residual ozone; despite the fact that initial ozone demand was never exceeded, quantifiable (though variable) inactivation of E. coli was observed, along with modest improvements of UV transmittance. Results from collimated beam experiments demonstrated that compliance with effluent discharge permit limitations could be achieved consistently with a UV254 dose of 12.4 mJ/cm2 at a pre-ozonation dose of 2 to 3 mg/L. In the absence of pre-ozonation, consistent compliance was observed at a UV dose of 16.5 mJ/cm2. No evidence of synergism between ozone and UV254 radiation was found in the measured inactivation responses of E. coli."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering and Division of Environmental & Ecological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2051, USA. blatch@purdue.edu"}], "LastName": "Blatchley", "ForeName": "Ernest R", "Initials": "ER", "Suffix": "3rd"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Shihchi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Afifi", "ForeName": "Mehrnaz Zare", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Hsiao-Han", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reichlin", "ForeName": "Douglas B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jousset", "ForeName": "St\u00e9phane", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Erhardt", "ForeName": "Richard S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23356017", "10.2175/106143012x13373550426634"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
