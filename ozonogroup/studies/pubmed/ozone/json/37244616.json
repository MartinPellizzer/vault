O<sub>3</sub> reduces steady-state net photosynthetic rate (A), and the adverse effects of O<sub>3</sub> are mitigated under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> condition. However, the combined effects of O<sub>3</sub> and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on dynamic photosynthesis under variable light conditions have not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effects of O<sub>3</sub> and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on dynamic photosynthesis in the leaves of Fagus crenata seedlings under variable light conditions. The seedlings were grown under four gas treatments comprising two levels of O<sub>3</sub> concentration (lower and two times higher than the ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentration) and two levels of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (ambient and 700\u00a0ppm). Although O<sub>3</sub> significantly decreased steady-state A under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, no significant decrease was observed under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, indicating the mitigating effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on O<sub>3</sub>-induced adverse effects on steady-state A. During photosynthetic induction, the response of A to the change in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) from 50 (low light) to 1000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> (high light) showed that the increase in A was slowed by O<sub>3</sub> and accelerated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Under fluctuating light condition of repeating low light for 4\u00a0min and high light for 1\u00a0min, A at end of each high light period gradually decreased in all treatments, and O<sub>3</sub> and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> accelerated the reduction of A. In contrast to steady-state A, no mitigating effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was observed for any parameters related to dynamic photosynthesis. We conclude that the combined effects of O<sub>3</sub> and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on A of F. crenata are different under steady-state and variable light conditions, and the O<sub>3</sub>-induced decrease in leaf A may not be mitigated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in the field under variable light conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
