The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Afterward the absolute configurations were determined. Biomimetic transformations revealed a possible biogenetic route, where stilbene trimers were enzymatically synthesized for the first time. In addition, their antioxidant activities were evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The results showed that stilbene oligomers with an unusual phenanthrene moiety exhibited much stronger antioxidant activities. Thus, the photocatalyzed cyclization of stilbenes was supposed to be an antioxidant activity promoting transformation, which was hypothesized to play a role in the antioxidative defense system of the plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yuanjiang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Liyan", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Biomimetic Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vitaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18549269", "10.1021/jo8001112"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
