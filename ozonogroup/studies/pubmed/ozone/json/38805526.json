Group A (17 patients) received ozone injection, group B (17 patients) received betamethasone injection and group C (17 patients) received combined ozone and betamethasone injections. The groups were compared based on the intensity of pain and correction of mitochondrial redox state of the patients.", "Three days after intervention, the visual analog scale (VAS) scores reported by patients were lower in group A compared to group B (with a mean difference 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.15-2.39 (P < 0.02). One and 3 weeks after intervention, VAS scores of patients were lower in groups A and C compared to group B. At one week the mean difference between A and B was 1.2, with a 95% CI of 0.15-2.25 (P < 0.02) and the mean difference between C and B was 1.73 with a 95% CI of 0.69-2.78 (P < 0.001).
