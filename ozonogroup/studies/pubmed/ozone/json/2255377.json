The question was studied whether this affected pulmonary function of children aged 7 to 12 years practising sports in the open air. Before and after sessions of training in the open air, the peak expiratory flow rate was determined using peak flow meters (mini-Wright). This was done on 37 different days with varying ozone concentrations. Measurements were carried out on four or more days in a total of 65 children. No correlation between ozone concentration during training and differences between pre- and post-training peak flows was found. No correlation was found either between the maximal ozone concentration on a given day and the peak flow at the end of training on that day. However, a negative correlation was found between the maximal ozone concentration on the day preceding the pulmonary function tests and the peak flow after the training."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vakgroep Gezondheidsleer Landbouwuniversiteit, Wageningen."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kosterink", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van de Berg", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoek", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brunekreef", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "De invloed van verhoogde ozonconcentraties in de buitenlucht op de longfunctie van sportende kinderen."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd", "NlmUniqueID": "0400770", "ISSNLinking": "0028-2162"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sports"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2255377"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
