Conventional control strategies such as flow pacing or residual trim ignore chemical demand/decay, inactivation kinetics, and other factors governing disinfection performance in continuous-flow reactors such as reactor hydraulics and process variability. This study presents the development, verification, and pilot-scale validation of a novel CT-based real-time disinfection control strategy, derived from first principles, and applied to peracetic acid disinfection of municipal secondary effluent wastewater. Validation experiments were carried out using a 3-m<sup>3</sup> pilot contact basin of which the hydraulic performance was first characterized by means of tracer tests and then mathematically modeled using the well-established theoretical framework of continuous stirred-tank reactors in series. The analytical model describing hydraulic performance was subsequently extended to take into account disinfectant demand/decay and microbial inactivation kinetics. The integrated model was successfully used to predict, and control, residual peracetic acid as well as microbial concentration in the pilot effluent. Validation studies conclusively supported that the novel CT-based control strategy was superior in maintaining constant disinfection performance, desired microbial counts, and low residual disinfectant under variable flow and wastewater quality. When compared with flow pacing, the CT-based control required two times less the amount of chemical for the same treatment objective (<100\u202fcfu/100\u202fmL). Remarkably, the CT-based control strategy could be extended to other chemical disinfection processes such as chlorination and ozonation, alone or in combination with physical treatment technologies such as membranes and ultraviolet irradiation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
