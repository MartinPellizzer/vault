It is shown that the seasonal ozone variations at these GAW stations are rather different, particularly between the western and eastern locations. Compared with western China, eastern China has lower background ozone levels. However, the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) can transport photochemical pollutants from the southern to the northern areas in eastern China, leading to a northward gradual enhancement of background ozone levels at the eastern GAW stations. Over China, the tropospheric column ozone densities peak during spring and summer in the areas that are directly and/or indirectly affected by the ASM, and the peak time lags from the south to the north in eastern China. We also investigated the regional representativeness of seasonal variations of ozone at the six Chinese GAW stations using the yearly maximum tropospheric column month as indicator. The results show that the seasonal variation characteristics of ozone revealed by the Chinese GAW stations are typical, with each station having a considerable large surrounding area with the ozone maximum occurring at the same month. Ozone variations at the GAW stations are influenced by many complex factors and their regional representativeness needs to be investigated further in a broader sense."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
