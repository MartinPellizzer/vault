NCD was fabricated on fused silica substrates by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) method. Different surface terminations were performed through exposure to reactive hydrogen and by UV induced oxidation during ozone treatment. Boron doped NCD coatings were also prepared and investigated. NCD surface wettability was determined by contact angle measurement. To assess biocompatibility of the NCD coatings, the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was used. Cells were plated directly onto diamond surfaces and cultured in medium with or without fetal bovine serum (FBS), in order to evaluate the ability of cells to adhere and to proliferate. The obtained results showed that these cells adhered and proliferated better on NCD surfaces than on the bare fused silica. The cell proliferation on NCD in medium with and without FBS after 48h from plating was on average, respectively, 20 and 58% higher than that on fused silica, irrespective of NCD surface modification. Our results showed that the hydrogenated, oxygenated and boron-doped NCD coatings can be used for biomedical purposes, especially where good optical transparency is required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.
