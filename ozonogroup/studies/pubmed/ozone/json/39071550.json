Most detection methods are labor-intensive, lack speed for early detection, or result in high infrastructure costs. An essential approach to mitigating this issue involves establishing an efficient forest fire warning system based on amalgamating diverse available data sources and optimized algorithms. This research endeavors to develop a binary machine-learning classifier based on Thailand's forest fire occurrences from January 2019 to October 2022 using data acquired from satellite resources, including the Google Earth engine. We use four gas variables including carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The study explores a range of classification models, encompassing linear classifiers, gradient-boosting classifiers, and artificial neural networks. The XGBoost model is the top-performing option across various classification evaluation metrics. The model provides the accuracy of 99.6\u00a0% and ROC-AUC score of 0.939. These findings underscore the necessity for a comprehensive forest fire warning system that integrates gas measurement sensor devices and geospatial data. A feedback mechanism is also imperative to enable model retraining post-deployment, thereby diminishing reliance on geospatial attributes. Moreover, given that decision-tree-based algorithms consistently yield superior results, future research in machine learning for forest fire prediction should prioritize these approaches."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Authors."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International School of Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Disaster and Risk Management Information Systems Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International School of Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Weeramongkolkul", "ForeName": "Manapat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Suwankesawong", "ForeName": "Supanida", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Saengtabtim", "ForeName": "Kumpol", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Disaster and Risk Management Information Systems Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of System Design and Management, Keio University Collaboration Complex, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Kohoku-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, 223-8526, Japan."}], "LastName": "Leelawat", "ForeName": "Natt", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Wongwailikhit", "ForeName": "Kritchart", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "World Health Organization.
