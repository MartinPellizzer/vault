Here, we report results from an extensive sampling of plant biomass and soil conducted at the conclusion of the experiment that enabled us to estimate ecosystem carbon (C) content and cumulative net primary productivity (NPP). Elevated CO2 enhanced ecosystem C content by 11%, whereas elevated O3 decreased ecosystem C content by 9%. There was little variation in treatment effects on C content across communities and no meaningful interactions between CO2 and O3 . Treatment effects on ecosystem C content resulted primarily from changes in the near-surface mineral soil and tree C, particularly differences in woody tissues. Excluding the mineral soil, cumulative NPP was a strong predictor of ecosystem C content (r(2) = 0.96). Elevated CO2 enhanced cumulative NPP by 39%, a consequence of a 28% increase in canopy nitrogen (N) content (g N m(-2) ) and a 28% increase in N productivity (NPP/canopy N). In contrast, elevated O3 lowered NPP by 10% because of a 21% decrease in canopy N, but did not impact N productivity. Consequently, as the marginal impact of canopy N on NPP (\u2206NPP/\u2206N) decreased through time with further canopy development, the O3 effect on NPP dissipated. Within the mineral soil, there was less C in the top 0.1 m of soil under elevated O3 and less soil C from 0.1 to 0.2 m in depth under elevated CO2 . Overall, these results suggest that elevated CO2 may create a sustained increase in NPP, whereas the long-term effect of elevated O3 on NPP will be smaller than expected. However, changes in soil C are not well-understood and limit our ability to predict changes in ecosystem C content."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 The Authors Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest, Rangeland, & Fire Sciences, College of Natural Resources, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 83844, USA."}], "LastName": "Talhelm", "ForeName": "Alan F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pregitzer", "ForeName": "Kurt S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kubiske", "ForeName": "Mark E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zak", "ForeName": "Donald R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Campany", "ForeName": "Courtney E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burton", "ForeName": "Andrew J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dickson", "ForeName": "Richard E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hendrey", "ForeName": "George R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Isebrands", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lewin", "ForeName": "Keith F", "Initials": "KF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagy", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karnosky", "ForeName": "David F", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Glob Chang Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9888746", "ISSNLinking": "1354-1013"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Acer"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "\u00c5gren GI.
