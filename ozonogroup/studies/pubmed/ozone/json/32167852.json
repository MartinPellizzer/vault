The present work aims to evaluate the efficiency of advanced oxidations processes, using UV radiation, O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>\u2009+\u2009UV in the degradation of geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) in synthetic samples. The efficiency of the processes was monitored by Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry using solid phase microextration technique. Experiments were carried out for 45\u2005min with samplings every 15\u2005min. The degradation results showed that UV radiation alone was not efficient for the degradation of both compounds. The fasted decay was observed by the combined use of O<sub>3</sub> and UV with an ozone concentration of 15.84\u2005mg\u2005L<sup>-1</sup>. Under these conditions, the final concentration of GSM was below the limit of quantification, so that approximately 99% of the initial concentration was degraded, while 2-MIB was degraded by 95%. With the same O<sub>3</sub> concentration without the use of UV radiation, 63% and 65.7% of MIB and GSM, respectively, were removed. Higher efficiency of the treatment was observed with a higher O<sub>3</sub> concentration which allows a shorter reaction time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5911-0085"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology Post-graduation Program, University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC), Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Berlt", "ForeName": "Mariana Maria Gassen", "Initials": "MMG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1400-8401"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology Post-graduation Program, University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC), Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Excellence in Oilchemistry and Biotechnology, University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC), Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Schneider", "ForeName": "Rosana de Cassia de Souza", "Initials": "RCS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0140-4966"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology Post-graduation Program, University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC), Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Excellence in Oilchemistry and Biotechnology, University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC), Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Machado", "ForeName": "\u00canio Leandro", "Initials": "\u00caL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3278-8966"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology Post-graduation Program, University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC), Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Excellence in Oilchemistry and Biotechnology, University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC), Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Kist", "ForeName": "Lourdes Teresinha", "Initials": "LT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2371-42-8", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methylisoborneol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MYW912WXJ4", "NameOfSubstance": "geosmin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32167852", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1743371"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
