Industrial parks emit significant amounts of VOCs in China, while few studies have characterized them. In the present study, a mobile platform was employed to measure the levels and composition VOCs around industrial parks in the Yangzte River Delta region. The average concentration of VOCs ranged from 39 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (5% percentile) to 533 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (95% percentile) with an average of 183 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, which was three times that of ambient concentrations. Maximum VOC concentrations ranged from 307 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (5% percentile) to 12006 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (95% percentile) with an average of 2812 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The frequency of abnormal peak values was as high as 64% across all the industrial parks, of which toluene (32%), xylene (18%), benzene (9%), and>C9 aromatics (19%) were the most common species. Differences in VOC characteristics were observed among the different types of industrial parks. Specifically, highest concentrations of VOCs were observed in textile industrial parks followed by chemical, painting, and petrochemical industrial parks, and VOC concentrations in electronics industrial parks were the lowest. Importantly, species measured using the mobile platform only contributed~50% of VOCs present in ambient samples, indicating that the concentrations of VOCs in the industrial parks were underestimated overall. These results can inform measures to control VOC pollution in industrial parks in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Li", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ya-Qin", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Sheng-Ao", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Sheng-Rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Qing-Yao", "Initials": "QY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jing-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yu-Hang", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometry and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TOFWERK China, Nanjing 211800, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33742926", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202007265"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
