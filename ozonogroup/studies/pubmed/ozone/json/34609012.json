Measurements in approximately 2000 indoor environments (residences, schools, and offices) show a central tendency for average indoor ozone concentration of 4-6\u00a0ppb and an indoor to outdoor concentration ratio of about 25%. Considerable variability in this ratio exists among buildings, as influenced by seven building-associated factors: ozone removal in mechanical ventilation systems, ozone penetration through the building envelope, air-change rates, ozone loss rate on fixed indoor surfaces, ozone loss rate on human occupants, ozone loss by homogeneous reaction with nitrogen oxides, and ozone loss by reaction with gas-phase organics. Among these, the most important are air-change rates, ozone loss rate on fixed indoor surfaces, and, in densely occupied spaces, ozone loss rate on human occupants. Although most indoor ozone originates outdoors and enters with ventilation air, indoor emission sources can materially increase indoor ozone concentrations. Mitigation technologies to reduce indoor ozone concentrations are available or are being investigated. The most mature of these technologies, activated carbon filtration of mechanical ventilation supply air, shows a high modeled health-benefit to cost ratio when applied in densely occupied spaces."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
