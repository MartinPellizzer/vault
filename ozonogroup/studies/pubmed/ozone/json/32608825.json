The results show that:\u2460 From the in-situ observed daily average concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, good or mild to moderate pollution occurred in January, February, October, November, and December every year, and the rest of the time was excellent. \u2461 Based on the annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration obtained by satellite for the past 20 years, the spatial characteristics showed that the external radiation is centered on Guangzhou and Foshan. The time evolution shows the characteristics of an \u03a9 shape, which increases gradually from 2000 to 2009, is highest in 2008, and then gradually decreases. \u2462 The monthly average aerosol optical thickness (AOT) value from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer satellite reversion every 10 years for a period (2000-2009 for a period, 2010-2018 for a period) was used to see the monthly variation. The monthly average AOT value in the first period was larger than that in the second period of the same month, the maximum value was in March and April, and the minimum value was in November and December. It is envisaged to draw a line along the north-south direction of the Pearl River Port, which basically shows that the AOT value in the west is greater than that in the east. \u2463 According to the observed daily average concentration data of O<sub>3</sub>-8h, the main concentration level of O<sub>3</sub>-8h in the GBA is excellent. The cities with good ozone concentration were most numerous in 2014, with five cities, and least in 2018, with only one city. The highest ozone concentration was in September, followed by June and November, and then May and July. In the past 20 years, the spatial distribution of the average concentration of O<sub>3</sub> monitored by satellite remote sensing showed a characteristic \u03a9 shape, increasing initially and then decreasing. The maximum value was in May, and the north-south boundary line appeared in space. \u2464 There is a good linear relationship between the interannual variation of monthly mean temperature and radiation, whereas the relationship between AOT and radiation cannot be described by a simple linear relationship."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yao-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Jia-Cheng", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Zuo-Fang", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qing-Chun", "Initials": "QC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Climate Center, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "You-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608825", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201906228"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
