However, the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in this process is less evaluated. This study investigated the DBP formation and the relevant toxicity during the O<sub>3</sub>-BAC-UV/chlor(am)ine treatment of sand-filtered municipal secondary effluent. DBP formation in UV/chlorine and UV/dichloramine (NHCl<sub>2</sub>) processes were compared, where the impact of key operational parameters (e.g., UV wavelength, pH) on DBP formation were comprehensively evaluated. O<sub>3</sub>-BAC significantly reduced DBP formation potential (DBPFP) (58.2\u00a0%). Compared to UV/chlorine AOP, UV/NHCl<sub>2</sub> AOP reduced DBP formation by 29.7\u00a0% in short-time treatment, while insignificantly impacting on DBPFP (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). UV/NHCl<sub>2</sub> AOP also led to lower calculated cytotoxicity (67.7\u00a0%) and genotoxicity (55.9\u00a0%) of DBPs compared to UV/chlorine AOP. Compared to 254\u00a0nm UV light, the utilization of 285\u00a0nm UV light decreased the formation of DBPs in wastewater treated with the UV/chlorine AOP and UV/NHCl<sub>2</sub> AOP by 31.3\u00a0% and 19.2\u00a0%, respectively. However, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in UV/NHCl<sub>2</sub> AOP using 285\u00a0nm UV light increased by 83.4\u00a0% and 58.5\u00a0%, respectively, compared to 254\u00a0nm. The concentration of DBPs formed in the UV/NHCl<sub>2</sub> AOP at pH\u00a08 was 54.3\u00a0% lower than that at pH\u00a07, suggesting a better control of DBPs at alkaline condition. In the presence of bromide, UV/NHCl<sub>2</sub> AOP tended to generate more brominated DBPs than UV/chlorine AOP. Overall, UV/NHCl<sub>2</sub> AOP resulted in lower concentration and toxicity of DBPs compared to UV/chlorine AOP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
