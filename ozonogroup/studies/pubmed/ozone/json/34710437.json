In this panel study of 43 asthmatic children aged 5-13 years old, each child had 4 clinic visits with a 2-week interval between two consecutive visits. At each visit, saliva samples were collected and subsequently analyzed for interleukin 6 (IL-6) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) as biomarkers of inflammation and malondialdehyde (MDA) as a biomarker of oxidative stress in the oral cavity. At each visit, children were measured for fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) as a marker of pulmonary inflammation. Asthma symptoms of these children were measured using the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT). We found that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 24-h average personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> measured 1 and 2 days prior was associated with increased salivary IL-6 concentration by 3.0% (95%CI: 0.2%-6.0%) and 4.2% (0.7%-8.0%), respectively. However, we did not find a clear association between personal O<sub>3</sub> exposure and any of the salivary biomarkers, except for a negative association between salivary MDA and O<sub>3</sub> exposure measured 1 day prior. An IQR increase in salivary IL-6 concentration was associated with significantly increased FeNO by 28.8% (4.3%-53.4%). In addition, we found that increasing salivary IL-6 concentrations were associated with decreased individual and total C-ACT scores, indicating the worsening of asthma symptoms. We estimated that 13.2%-22.2% of the associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure measured 1 day prior with FeNO and C-ACT scores were mediated by salivary IL-6. These findings suggest that the induction of inflammation in the oral cavity may have played a role in linking air pollution exposure with the worsening of airway inflammation and asthma symptoms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
