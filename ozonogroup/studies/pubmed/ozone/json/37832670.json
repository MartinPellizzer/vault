Therefore, this study analyzed VOCs concentration and composition characteristics in urban area of Beijing from 2019 to 2020. The results showed that the concentration of VOCs in Chaoyang district in 2020 was 73.1ppbv, lower than that in 2019 (92.8ppbv), and alkanes (45\u00a0% and 47\u00a0%) were the most dominant components. The concentrations of isopentane, n-pentane, n-hexane, and OVOCs significantly increased in 2020. According to the results of the PMF model, the contribution of VOCs from vehicle and pharmaceutical-related emissions increased to 45.8\u00a0% and 27.1\u00a0% in 2020, while coal combustion decreased by 23.7\u00a0%. This is likely linked to the strict implementation of the coal conversion policy, as well as the increment in individual travel and pharmaceutical production during the pandemic. The calculation results of OFP and SOAFP indicated that toluene had an increased impact on the formation of O<sub>3</sub> and SOA in the Chaoyang district in 2020. Notably, VOCs emitted by vehicles have the highest potential for secondary generation. In addition, VOCs from vehicles and industries pose the greatest health risks, together accounting for 77.4\u00a0% and 79.31\u00a0% of the total carcinogenic risk in 2019 and 2020. Although industrial emission with the high proportions of halocarbons was controlled to some extent during the pandemic, the carcinogenic risk in 2020 was 3.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-6</sup>, which still exceeded the acceptable level, and more attention and governance efforts should be given to."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
