A total of 24,346 participants at baseline were included to conduct a cross-sectional study. The annual (2016) average pollutant concentrations were assessed by air monitoring stations for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and CO. Associations between annual ambient air pollution and low-grade systematic inflammation (hsCRP>3\u00a0mg/L) were estimated by generalized linear mixed models. Stratification analysis was also performed based on demographic characteristics, health-related behaviors and disease status. Annual ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were all associated with low-grade systematic inflammation in single-pollutant models after adjusting for age, sex, blood lipids, blood pressure, lifestyle risk factors, cooking fuel, heating fuel and habits during smog days (NO<sub>2</sub> per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.057, P\u00a0=\u00a00.018; O<sub>3</sub> per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.953, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012). The 2-year and 3-year ozone concentrations were consistently associated with lower systematic inflammation (2-year O<sub>3</sub> per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.959, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004; 3-year O<sub>3</sub> per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.961, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014). In two-pollutant models, the estimated effects of annual NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on low-grade systematic inflammation remained stable. The effect size of annual pollutants on inflammation increased in participants without air-purifier usage (NO<sub>2</sub> per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.079, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009; O<sub>3</sub> per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.925, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), while the association was null in the air-purifier usage group. Thus, long-term exposure to ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was associated with low-grade systemic inflammation, and the results were generally stable after sensitivity analysis. The usage of air purifiers on smog days can modify the association between gaseous pollutants and systematic inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
