The experiments were performed in a 405 L borosilicate glass chamber in synthetic air at 298 +/- 3 K using long path in situ FTIR spectroscopy for the analysis of the reactants and products. In the presence of NO(x) (NO + NO2) the main products for the OH-radical initiated oxidation of PVE were propylformate and formaldehyde with molar formation yields of 78.6 +/- 8.8% and 75.9 +/- 8.4%, respectively. In the absence of NO(x) propylformate and formaldehyde were formed with molar formation yields of 63.0 +/- 9.0% and 61.3 +/- 6.3%, respectively. In the reaction of NO3 radicals with PVE propylformate 52.7 +/- 5.9% and formaldehyde 55.0 +/- 6.3% were again observed as major products. The ozonolysis of PVE led to the production of propylformate, formaldehyde, hydroxyperoxymethyl formate (HPMF; HC(O)OCH2OOH), and CO with molar formation yields of 89.0 +/- 11.4%, 12.9 +/- 4.0%, 13.0 +/- 3.4%, and 10.9 +/- 2.6%, respectively. The formation yield of OH radicals in the ozonolysis of PVE was estimated to be 17 +/- 9%. Simple atmospheric degradation mechanisms are postulated to explain the formation of the observed products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory for Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Science, Peking University, 100871 Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shouming", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klotz", "ForeName": "Bj\u00f6rn", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Albu", "ForeName": "Mihaela", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bejan", "ForeName": "Iustinian", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benter", "ForeName": "Thorsten", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vinyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "propyl vinyl ether"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vinyl Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16999119", "10.1021/es0605422"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
