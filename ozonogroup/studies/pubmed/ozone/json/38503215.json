UiO-66 with high photocatalytic activity have shown great potential. However, the lack of active sites severely limited the trapping and degradation of OVOCs. Herein, reo-UiO-66 with increased specific surface area, hierarchical porous structure and tunable acidic/basic sites was synthesized by simply adding water as the modulator. XRD, TGA and FTIR results confirmed the formation of reo-defects, which significantly affected the surface hydrophilicity and active sites of UiO-66. The adsorption of Lewis acidic acetaldehyde was enhanced by 265 times with coordinative unsaturated Zr acting as the dominant adsorption sites. The degradation efficiency of typical OVOCs (acetaldehyde and acetone) increased from 0% and 25% to 50% and 73%, respectively. This work provided a facile method to modulate the micro-environment in MOFs for the efficient capture and catalytic purification of OVOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
