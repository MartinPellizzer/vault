In the present study, we investigated the concentration-dependency of the effects of exposure to O(3) on the aggravation of nasal allergy-like reactions induced by repeated nasal administration of antigen. Guinea pigs were exposed to filtered air or 0.1-0.6 ppm O(3) for 5 weeks. After each weekly administration of ovalbumin (OVA), sneezes and nasal secretions were measured. The number of eosinophils infiltrating the nasal septum and the titers of OVA-specific antibody were measured 24h after the last administration. Ozone increased sneezing and nasal secretion induced by OVA, nasal responsiveness to physical stimuli, and the number of infiltrating eosinophils in a concentration-dependent manner. The titer of anti-OVA-IgG was increased in animals exposed to 0.6 ppm O(3). Thus, exposure to O(3) aggravated nasal allergy-like symptoms concentration dependently. The aggravation was caused by induction of nasal hyperresponsiveness, the infiltration of eosinophils, and the increase in the production of anti-OVA-IgG. The estimated maximum likelihood estimation concentrations (MLECs) and bench mark concentrations (BMCs) of O(3) for these indices were in the range of 0.09-0.18 and 0.02-0.06 ppm, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Tsukuba University, Tsukuba 305-8575, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iijima", "ForeName": "Mariko K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benchmarking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sneezing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15126000", "10.1016/j.tox.2004.01.008", "S0300483X04000186"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
