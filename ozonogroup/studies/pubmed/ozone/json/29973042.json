We made simultaneous continuous time-resolved measurements of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and nitrous acid (HONO) for two months in an occupied detached home with gas appliances in Syracuse, NY. Indoor NO and HONO mixing ratios were higher than those outdoors, whereas O<sub>3</sub> was much lower (sub-ppbv) indoors. Cooking led to peak NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and HONO levels 20-100 times greater than background levels; HONO mixing ratios of up to 50 ppbv were measured. Our results suggest that many reported NO<sub>2</sub> levels may have a large positive bias due to HONO interference. Nitrous acid, NO<sub>2</sub>, and NO were removed from indoor air more rapidly than CO<sub>2</sub>, indicative of reactive removal processes or surface uptake. We measured spectral irradiance from sunlight entering the residence through glass doors; hydroxyl radical (OH) production rates of (0.8-10) \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> were calculated in sunlit areas due to HONO photolysis, in some cases exceeding rates expected from ozone-alkene reactions. Steady-state nitrate radical (NO<sub>3</sub>) mixing ratios indoors were predicted to be lower than 1.65 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>. This work will help constrain the temporal nature of oxidant concentrations in occupied residences and will improve indoor chemistry models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Syracuse University , Syracuse , New York 13244 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5031-1024"], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , York University , Toronto , Ontario M3J 1P3 , Canada."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6908-5829"], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "Cora J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , York University , Toronto , Ontario M3J 1P3 , Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "VandenBoer", "ForeName": "Trevor C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Syracuse University , Syracuse , New York 13244 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kowal", "ForeName": "Shawn F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Syracuse University , Syracuse , New York 13244 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5074-1155"], "LastName": "Kahan", "ForeName": "Tara F", "Initials": "TF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29973042", "10.1021/acs.est.8b01792"]}}]}
