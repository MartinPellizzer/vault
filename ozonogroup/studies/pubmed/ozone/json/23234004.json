The objective was to investigate the effect of elevated O3 on the AM structure and glomalin production in two genotypes, and to understand the effect of elevated O3 the growth of AM fungi and formation of AM structure. The results showed that in comparison with ambient O3 (20 nL x L(-1)), elevated O3 (70 nL x L(-1)) significantly decreased the mycorrhizal colonization rate in both genotypes, particularly the S156 plant (decreased by 43.6%). Elevated O3 exposed a great negative effect on the AM structure in both genotypes. For example, the arbuscule number per unit root, and the length of external hyphae in root compartment and hyphal compartment were significantly decreased, especially in S156 plant. However, the effect of elevated atmospheric O3 was not significant on the vesicule number per unit root in both genotypes. Total glomalin production in mycorrhizosphere and hyphosphere of both genotypes was only slightly affected by elevated O3, however, the production of easily extractable glomalin was significantly increased. In addition, no evident difference in glomalin concentration was observed between two genotypes at either ambient O3 or elevated O3. This study showed that the mycorrhizal colonization rate, AM structure and production of easily extractable glomalin gave great response to elevated O3 especially in the O3-sensitive plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Science, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Peng-Teng", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-Guang", "Initials": "SG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "glomalin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Root Nodules, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23234004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
