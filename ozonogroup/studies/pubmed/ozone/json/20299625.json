These studies provided suggestive but inconclusive results. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the association between air pollutants and the prevalence of bronchitic symptoms in the Taiwan Children Health Study.", "We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study of 5,049 Taiwanese children in 2007. Routine air pollution monitoring data were used for sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxides (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), carbon monoxide (CO), and particles with an aerodynamic diameter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM(2.5)). The exposure parameters were calculated using the between-community 3-year average concentration. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) per interquartile changes for SO(2), NO(2), O(3), CO, and PM(2.5).", "In the two-stage hierarchical model adjusting for confounding, the prevalence of bronchitic symptoms with asthma was positively associated with the between-community 3-year average concentrations of NO(2) (adjusted OR, 1.81 per 8.79 ppb; 95% CI, 1.14-2.86), and CO (OR, 1.31 per 105 ppb; 95% CI, 1.04-1.64). The prevalence of phlegm with no asthma was related to O(3) (OR, 1.32 per 8.77 ppb; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63).", "The results suggest that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants, such as NO(2), CO, and O(3), may increase the prevalence of bronchitic symptoms among children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Bing-Fang", "Initials": "BF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yungling Leo", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chest", "NlmUniqueID": "0231335", "ISSNLinking": "0012-3692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20299625", "10.1378/chest.09-2600", "S0012-3692(10)60546-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
