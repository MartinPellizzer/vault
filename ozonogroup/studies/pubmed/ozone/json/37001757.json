In the megacity of China, haze episodes can be aggravated by the interaction between aerosols and the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Such interactions have been largely investigated in the middle and upper PBL and less so near the ground. Here, using observations from the ground and in the PBL during summer, we find that haze pollution has decreased notably, but O<sub>3</sub> pollution has worsened in Nanjing. PM<sub>2.5</sub>, black carbon (BC), BC/PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) changed at rates of -0.34\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>\u00b7month<sup>-1</sup>, 13\u00a0ng\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>\u00b7month<sup>-1</sup>, 0.08%\u00b7month<sup>-1</sup>, -0.06\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>\u00b7month<sup>-1</sup> and 1.5\u00a0m\u00a0month<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (3.5\u00a0m\u00b7month<sup>-1</sup>excluding data from 2020) during 2015-2020. The height of the lower boundary of the temperature inversion layer decreased first and then increased at a rate of 5.4\u00a0m\u00a0month<sup>-1</sup> between 2017 and 2020. As the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration has decreased by 42.4% over the last six years, aerosol extinction has weakened in the PBL. Subsequently, the solar radiation has strengthened near the ground, which is conducive to forming O<sub>3</sub> and is mainly concentrated between 0 and 600\u00a0m. Due to the heating effect of BC, which can increase the temperature near the ground, the lower boundary of the inversion layer has been elevated, which further mitigates and aggravates the haze and O<sub>3</sub> pollution, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
