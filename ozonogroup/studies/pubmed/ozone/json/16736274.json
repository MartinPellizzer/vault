Pusa Kesar) plants using open top chambers (OTCs) ventilated with ambient (NFCs) or charcoal filtered air (FCs) at a suburban site of Varanasi, India. Various morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of the plants were studied at different growth stages. Air monitoring data clearly showed high concentrations of SO2, NO2 and O3 in the ambient air of study site. SO2 and NO2 concentrations were higher during early growth stages of carrot, whereas O3 concentration was highest during later growth stages. Filtration of air has caused significant reductions in all the three pollutant concentrations in FCs as compared to NFCs. Plants growing in FCs showed significantly higher photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and variable fluorescence as compared to plants growing in NFCs. Protein content also showed a similar pattern, however, lipid peroxidation, ascorbic acid content and peroxidase activity were higher in plants growing in NFCs as compared to FCs. Shoot length, number of leaves per plant, leaf area and root and shoot weight increased significantly upon filtration of ambient air. Total nitrogen decreased significantly in root, but increased significantly in shoot of plants grown in NFCs. Total P, Mg, Ca and K contents decreased significantly in plants grown in NFCs as compared to FCs. The individual pollutant concentrations were below threshold for plant injury, but the combined effect of all the three seems to act synergistically in causing greater adverse impact on dry weight and physiology of carrot plants. The study clearly indicates that air pollutants are high enough in the ambient air to cause significant unfavorable impact on carrot plants. The work further supports the usefulness of OTCs for assessing air pollution damage under field conditions in developing countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marshall", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Daucus carota"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Jan;89(1):159-64", "ArticleIdList": ["16666508"]}, {"Citation": "Methods Biochem Anal. 1954;1:27-52", "ArticleIdList": ["13193524"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1974 Aug 2;250(465):443-4", "ArticleIdList": ["4852889"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1995;90(3):323-9", "ArticleIdList": ["15091465"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1995;87(1):119-26", "ArticleIdList": ["15091614"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1995;88(2):147-54", "ArticleIdList": ["15091554"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1989;59(4):337-44", "ArticleIdList": ["15092401"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 1973 Nov 1;7(11):1056-9", "ArticleIdList": ["22263951"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2003;126(3):323-9", "ArticleIdList": ["12963293"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1968 Apr;125(1):189-98", "ArticleIdList": ["5655425"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1951 Nov;193(1):265-75", "ArticleIdList": ["14907713"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Apr;74(4):846-51", "ArticleIdList": ["16663520"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1991;69(2-3):151-68", "ArticleIdList": ["15092158"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1990;64(2):93-106", "ArticleIdList": ["15092295"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Exp Bot. 2001 Aug;46(1):81-91", "ArticleIdList": ["11378175"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16736274", "10.1007/s10661-005-9001-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
