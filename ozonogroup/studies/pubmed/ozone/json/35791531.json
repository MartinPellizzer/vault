Then, the regional VOCs concentrations, generation potential, and source of VOCs were studied. The results showed that the average <i>\u03c6</i>(VOCs) was (20.5\u00b110.5)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan area, in which OVOCs (33.5%) and alkanes (28.2%) accounted for the highest proportion. The ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs was 118.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the contributions of aromatic hydrocarbons, olefin, and OVOCs to OFP were 37.4%, 24.2%, and 23.6%, respectively. The average secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOA<sub>p</sub>) of the VOCs was 0.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the contribution of aromatic hydrocarbons to SOA<sub>p</sub> was 97.0%, among which C8 aromatic hydrocarbons contributed 41.7%. Toluene, <i>m/p</i>-xylene, and <i>o</i>-xylene were the common dominant species that contributed significantly to OFP and SOA<sub>p</sub>. The characteristic ratio results showed that VOCs in Changsha were relatively influenced by industrial processes and solvent use, whereas Zhuzhou and Xiangtan were more affected by coal and biomass combustion. The PMF results showed that the VOCs mainly came from vehicle exhaust and oil and gas volatilization (27.2%), coal and biomass combustion (23.7%), industrial processes (20.4%), solvent use (17.2%), and natural sources (11.5%) in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technical Center of Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection for Air Pollution Control, Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Da-Tong", "Initials": "DT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technical Center of Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection for Air Pollution Control, Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qing-Mei", "Initials": "QM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technical Center of Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection for Air Pollution Control, Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technical Center of Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection for Air Pollution Control, Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Xiang-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technical Center of Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection for Air Pollution Control, Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technical Center of Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection for Air Pollution Control, Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yun-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing-Qiao", "Initials": "JQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35791531", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202109163"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
