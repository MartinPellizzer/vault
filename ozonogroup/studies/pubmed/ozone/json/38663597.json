In some provinces and cities, diurnal regulations of O<sub>3</sub> precursor were implemented, such as shifting O<sub>3</sub> precursor emission processes to nighttime and offering preferential refueling at night. However, the effectiveness of these policies remains unverified, and their impact on the O<sub>3</sub> generation process requires further elucidation. In this study, we utilized a regional climate and air quality model (WRF-Chem, v4.5) to test three scenarios aimed at exploring the impact of diurnal industry emission variation of O<sub>3</sub> precursors on O<sub>3</sub> formation. Significant O<sub>3</sub> variations were observed mainly in urban areas. Shifting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to nighttime have slight decreased daytime O<sub>3</sub> levels while moving nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nighttime elevates O<sub>3</sub> levels. Simultaneously moving both to nighttime showed combined effects. Process analysis indicates that the diurnal variation in O<sub>3</sub> was mainly attributed to chemical process and vertical mixing in urban areas, while advection becomes more important in non-urban areas, contributing to the changes in O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> precursors levels through regional transportation. Further photochemical analysis reveals that the O<sub>3</sub> photochemical production in urban areas was affected by reduced daytime O<sub>3</sub> precursors emissions. Specifically, decreasing VOCs lowered the daytime O<sub>3</sub> production by reducing the ROx radicals (ROx\u00a0=\u00a0HO\u00a0+\u00a0HO\u02d9<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0RO\u02d9<sub>2</sub>), whereas decreasing NOx promoted the daytime O<sub>3</sub> production by weakening ROx radical loss. Our results demonstrate that diurnal regulation of O<sub>3</sub> precursors will disrupt the ROx radical and O<sub>3</sub> formation in local areas, resulting in a change in O<sub>3</sub> concentration and atmospheric oxidation capacity, which should be considered in formulating new relevant policies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
