A method has been developed for the sensitive analysis of p-CBA in water using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A reporting limit in water of 100 ng/L was determined for the method, which is 40-fold lower than the 4.0 microg/L reporting limit of the widely used liquid chromatography with UV detection (LC-UV) method. The method was found to be robust in difficult matrices such as wastewater and highly selective, unlike LC-UV which relies on non-specific detection at 234 nm. The detection of p-CBA below 1 microg/L during bench-scale ozonation of wastewater after hydrogen peroxide addition was demonstrated. Duplicate samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and LC-UV and results were found to be comparable at concentrations quantifiable by both methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Southern Nevada Water Authority, Henderson, NV 89015, USA. brett.vanderford@snwa.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vanderford", "ForeName": "Brett J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosario-Ortiz", "ForeName": "Fernando L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Snyder", "ForeName": "Shane A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17689544", "10.1016/j.chroma.2007.07.035", "S0021-9673(07)01246-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
