However, we know little about their ability to nucleate ice and their impact on ice formation in clouds. Ice nucleation by microplastics could also limit their long-range transport and global distribution. The present study explores the heterogeneous ice-nucleating ability of seven microplastic samples in immersion freezing mode. Two polypropylene samples and one polyethylene terephthalate sample froze heterogeneously with median freezing temperatures of -20.9, -23.2, and -21.9 \u00b0C, respectively. The number of ice nucleation sites per surface area, <i>n</i><sub>s</sub>(<i>T</i>), ranged from 10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> in a temperature interval of -15 to -25 \u00b0C, which is comparable to that of volcanic ash and fungal spores. After exposure to ozone or a combination of UV light and ozone, simulating atmospheric aging, the ice nucleation activity decreased in some cases and remained unchanged in others. Our freezing data suggest that microplastics may promote ice formation in cloud droplets. In addition, based on a comparison of our freezing results and previous simulations using a global transport model, ice nucleation by microplastics will impact their long-range transport to faraway locations and global distribution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5971-2502"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Seifried", "ForeName": "Teresa M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6183-6889"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Nikkho", "ForeName": "Sepehr", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0009-3707-9385"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z3, Canada."}], "LastName": "Morales Murillo", "ForeName": "Aurelio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4222-1701"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Andrew", "ForeName": "Lucas J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5264-2644"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "Edward R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5621-2323"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Bertram", "ForeName": "Allan K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39172764", "10.1021/acs.est.4c02639"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
