Their use has also previously been proposed for stratospheric solar radiation management (SSRM). Little is known about the heterogeneous chemistry of calcite aerosols with trace gases HNO<sub>3</sub> and HCl and therefore their potential impact on stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Here we report the results of an experimental study of the uptake of HNO<sub>3</sub> and HCl onto submicron CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles in two different flow reactors. Products and reaction kinetics were observed by impacting aerosolized CaCO<sub>3</sub> onto ZnSe windows, exposing them to the reagent gases at a wide range of concentrations, at 296 K and under dry conditions, and analyzing the particles before and after trace gas exposure using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). A Ca(OH)(HCO<sub>3</sub>) termination layer was detected in the form of a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> peak in the FTIR spectra, indicating a hydrated surface even under dry conditions. The results demonstrate the reaction of HNO<sub>3</sub> with Ca(OH)(HCO<sub>3</sub>) to produce Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, water, and CO<sub>2</sub>. HCl reacted with Ca(OH)(HCO<sub>3</sub>) to produce CaCl<sub>2</sub> and also water and CO<sub>2</sub>. The depletion of the Ca(OH)(HCO<sub>3</sub>)/Ca(CO<sub>3</sub>) signal due to reaction with HNO<sub>3</sub> or HCl followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. From the FTIR analysis, the reactive uptake coefficient for HNO<sub>3</sub> was determined to be in the range of 0.013 \u2264 \u03b3<sub>HNO3</sub> \u2264 0.14, and that for HCl was 0.0011 \u2264 \u03b3<sub>HCl</sub> \u2264 0.012 within the reported uncertainty. The reaction of HCl with airborne CaCO<sub>3</sub> aerosols was also studied in an aerosol flow tube coupled with a quadrupole chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) under similar conditions to the FTIR study, and \u03b3<sub>HCl</sub> was determined to be 0.013 \u00b1 0.001. Following previous modeling studies, these results suggest that the reactions of HCl and HNO<sub>3</sub> with calcite in the stratosphere could ameliorate the potential for stratospheric solar radiation management to lead to stratospheric ozone depletion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "LastName": "Huynh", "ForeName": "Han N", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0379-6916"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "LastName": "McNeill", "ForeName": "V Faye", "Initials": "VF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32324406", "10.1021/acs.jpca.9b11691"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
