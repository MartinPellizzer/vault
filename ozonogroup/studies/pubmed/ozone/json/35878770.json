Through optimizing the parameters continuously, the COD, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, UV<sub>254</sub> and colority respectively descended to 417.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.72\u00a0mg/L, 9.77\u00a0mg/L, 1.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 and 40 times, and 3D fluorescence also reduced significantly within 14\u00a0days. Target genes of AOB-amoA, nxrA, napA, nirS and nosZ analysis indicated that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrated bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria played a key role on nitrogen removal, aerobic denitrifying bacteria was dominated especially. The nitrogen removal process was as follows: catalytic ozonation converted nitrogen-containing organic matter into NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, then NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N was converted into NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-N and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N with the action of ammonia oxidation, nitrification and catalytic ozonation. Finally, the denitrification microorganisms transformed NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N or NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-N to N<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, this coupled process realized the nitrogen removal effectively from landfill leachate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
