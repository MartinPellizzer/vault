We assessed potential variability in the magnitude of this association for non-accidental, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and lung cancer mortality in a country-wide administrative cohort by exposure assessment method and by adjustment for geographic subdivisions.", "We used the Belgian 2001 census linked to population and mortality register including nearly 5.5 million adults aged \u226530 (mean follow-up: 9.97\u00a0years). Annual mean concentrations for fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), black carbon (BC) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were assessed at baseline residential address using two exposure methods; Europe-wide hybrid land use regression (LUR) models [100x100m], and Belgium-wide interpolation-dispersion (RIO-IFDM) models [25x25m]. We used Cox proportional hazards models with age as the underlying time scale and adjusted for various individual and area-level covariates. We further adjusted main models for two different area-levels following the European Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS); NUTS-1 (n\u00a0=\u00a03), or NUTS-3 (n\u00a0=\u00a043).", "We found no consistent differences between both exposure methods. We observed most robust associations with lung cancer mortality. Hazard Ratios (HRs) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase for NO<sub>2</sub> were 1.060 (95%CI 1.042-1.078) [hybrid LUR] and 1.040 (95%CI 1.022-1.058) [RIO-IFDM]. Associations with non-accidental, respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease mortality were generally null in main models but were enhanced after further adjustment for NUTS-1 or NUTS-3. HRs for non-accidental mortality per 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase for PM<sub>2.5</sub> for the main model using hybrid LUR exposure were 1.023 (95%CI 1.011-1.035). After including random effects HRs were 1.044 (95%CI 1.033-1.057) [NUTS-1] and 1.076 (95%CI 1.060-1.092) [NUTS-3].", "Long-term air pollution exposure was associated with higher lung cancer mortality risk but not consistently with the other studied causes.
