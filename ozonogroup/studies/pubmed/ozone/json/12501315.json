Though the effect of stressors used in combination was very detrimental to the above processes, selected concentrations of ozone not only counteracted the UV-B-induced inhibition of the above processes, but also stimulated O(2)-evolution and the photochemical electron transport chain. Kinetics of nutrient uptake and enzyme activities demonstrated that UV-B causes structural change(s) in the enzymes/carriers responsible for the uptake of NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-), urea and PO(4)(3+) as well as their assimilatory enzymes. Except for nitrate reductase, copper was found to compete for the binding sites of all the above enzymes. Synergistic inhibition of photosynthetic activity, nutrient (except NH(4)(+)) uptake, and enzyme activities by UV-B+Cu seems to be due to increased Cu uptake as a consequence of altered membrane permeability brought about by the peroxidation of membrane lipids in UV-B-exposed cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokai University, Numazu 410-03, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Pramoda Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Lal Chand", "Initials": "LC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0165543", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1260"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12501315", "10.2323/jgam.43.281"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
