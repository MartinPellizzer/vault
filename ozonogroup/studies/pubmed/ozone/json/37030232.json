In this study, ozone/hydrogen peroxide (O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and ozone/peroxymonosulfate (O<sub>3</sub>/PMS) were investigated to control NDMA formation, and O<sub>3</sub>/PMS (50-65 %) was more effective than O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10-25 %) with a ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or PMS to O<sub>3</sub> of 8:1. The reaction of PMS or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to decompose ozone could not compete with the ozonation of model compound because of the high second-order rate constants of the ozonation of DMZ (5\u00a0\u00d710<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) or 2-F-DMH (1.6\u00a0\u00d710<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The R<sub>ct</sub> value of the sulfate radical (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) showed a linear relationship with NDMA formation, indicating that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> significantly contributed to its control. NDMA formation could be further controlled by injecting small quantities of ozone numerous times to minimize the dissolved ozone concentration. The effects of tannic acid, bromide and bicarbonate on NDMA formation were also investigated during ozonation, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>/PMS processes. Bromate formation was more pronounced in the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process than in the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. Therefore, in practical applications of O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>/PMS processes, the generation of NDMA and bromate should be detected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
