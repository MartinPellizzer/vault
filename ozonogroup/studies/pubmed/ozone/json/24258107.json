The study was performed in both the batch and the continuous flow systems. The treatment efficiency was determined through three different methods, i.e., chemical oxygen demand (COD), fluorescence and ultraviolet (UV) absorption. Fluorescence and UV absorption techniques were employed due to their specificity in measurement of humic substances, aromatic compounds and heterocyclic systems, whereas COD is a general parameter for the estimation of total organic matter. Fluorescence and UV absorbance values were correlated with respective COD values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Petroleum and Minerals Dhahran, Saudi Arabia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bari", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Water Pollut Control Fed. 1973 Dec;45(12):2521-36", "ArticleIdList": ["4769857"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24258107", "10.1007/BF00399469"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
