The UV absorption cross sections (\u03c3(3HA)(\u03bb)) were obtained in the wavelength range 240-350 nm. The photodissociation rate of 3HA relative to that of NO(2) was measured by a solar simulator at 760 Torr and was determined to be J(1)/J(NO2) = (4.7 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10(-3). Using the obtained \u03c3(3HA)(\u03bb) and J(1)/J(NO2), the effective photodissociation quantum yield was calculated to be \u03a6(3HA) = 0.25 \u00b1 0.06. The rate coefficient for the reaction with OH radicals was measured by the relative rate method with three reference compounds and was determined to be k(2) = (6.9 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The rate coefficient for the reaction with ozone was measured by an absolute method and was determined to be k(3) = (3.5 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10(-17) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). Using the obtained rate coefficients, the daytime atmospheric lifetime of 3HA was estimated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Environment Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jia-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "Miyuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuroda", "ForeName": "Ayako", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Obi", "ForeName": "Kinichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imamura", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9DC2K31JJQ", "NameOfSubstance": "n-hexanal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22799591", "10.1021/jp303202h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
