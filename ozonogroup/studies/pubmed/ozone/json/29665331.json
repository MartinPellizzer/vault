The quantum chemical calculations find that the reaction leads to the formation of hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydroxysulfinyl radical (HOSO) via a low energy barrier pathway. Experimentally the formation of OH was monitored via its reaction with methane, which itself is relatively unreactive with <sup>3</sup>SO<sub>2</sub>, making it a suitable probe of OH production from the reaction of <sup>3</sup>SO<sub>2</sub> and water. This reaction has implications for the formation of OH in environments that are assumed to be depleted in OH, such as volcanic plumes. This reaction also provides a mechanism for the formation of OH in planetary atmospheres with little or no oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) or ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) present."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of Colorado Boulder , UCB 215 , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , University of Colorado Boulder , UCB 216 , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4980-0060"], "LastName": "Kroll", "ForeName": "Jay A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Copenhagen , Universitetsparken 5 , Copenhagen \u00d8 DK-2100 , Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frandsen", "ForeName": "Benjamin N", "Initials": "BN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Copenhagen , Universitetsparken 5 , Copenhagen \u00d8 DK-2100 , Denmark."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7275-8297"], "LastName": "Kjaergaard", "ForeName": "Henrik G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of Colorado Boulder , UCB 215 , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , University of Colorado Boulder , UCB 216 , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5863-8056"], "LastName": "Vaida", "ForeName": "Veronica", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29665331", "10.1021/acs.jpca.8b03524"]}}]}
