There were 3.2 million deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 495,000 deaths due to asthma. COPD was the seventh leading cause of years of life lost (YLLs). Overall, prevalent cases of CRDs were 545 million: about 50% for COPD and 50% for asthma. Incident cases of CRDs were 62 million, mostly due to asthma (69%) and COPD (29%). COPD accounted for 81.6 million disability-adjusted life years, asthma for 22.8 million. COPD prevalence of 9.1% has been found in a recent general population sample of North-Eastern Italy, while in Central Italy a 25-year follow-up of a general population sample has shown an increased prevalence of COPD and asthma up to 6.8% and 7.8%, respectively. In Central Italy, a COPD incidence of 8% and an asthma incidence of 3.2% have been found in adult subjects at an 18-year follow-up. Among the risk factors, a relevant role is played by smoking and high body mass index for asthma, while smoking, particulate matter pollution, ambient ozone pollution, occupational exposure to particulate matter, gases and fumes, as well as second-hand smoke, play an important role for COPD. Forecasting the YLLs by 2040 indicates a rising toll from several NCDs due to population growth and aging, with COPD expected to reach the fourth leading cause. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Several recent studies and international reports highlighted the huge global health burden of CRDs and other major NCDs, pointing out the need for implementing international collaborations to fight this epidemic trend."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council (CNR), Palermo, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Physiology (IFC), National Research Council (CNR), Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Viegi", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Physiology (IFC), National Research Council (CNR), Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Maio", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council (CNR), Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Fasola", "ForeName": "Salvatore", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Physiology (IFC), National Research Council (CNR), Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Baldacci", "ForeName": "Sandra", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "101475057", "ISSNLinking": "1941-2711"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Burden of Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality-Adjusted Life Years"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32423274", "10.1089/jamp.2019.1576"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
