This study examined quantitative and temporal alterations in tracheobronchial mucociliary clearance function and bronchial epithelial secretory cells in rabbits exposed to sulfuric acid (125 micrograms/m3), ozone (0.1 ppm), and their combination for 2 h/d, 5 d/wk for up to 1 yr; some animals were allowed a 6-month post-exposure period. Clearance times were altered during exposure to sulfuric acid or to the mixture, and became progressively slower following the end of exposures to each of the pollutant atmospheres. There was no indication of any interaction in terms of clearance response between the acid and ozone in the group exposed to the mixture. Histological examination of intrapulmonary conducting airways was performed after 4, 8, or 12 months of exposure, and after the post-exposure period. Sulfuric acid resulted in an increase in the number of secretory cells in small airways by 12 months of exposure. Ozone and the mixture resulted in an increase in secretory cell number by 4 months, but the response became attenuated with continued exposure. There was evidence for synergistic interaction between ozone and acid at 4 months, and antagonistic interaction at subsequent times. No inflammation or other biologically significant histological effects were found in any of the animals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlesinger", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gorczynski", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dennison", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richards", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinney", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bosland", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES04458", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O40UQP6WCF", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mucociliary Clearance"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1516570", "10.3109/01902149209064343"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
