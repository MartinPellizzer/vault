Consequently, calls come from global, Pan-European, and national authorities to gain insight into, limit, and stringently qualify the use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, as well as in food production. Dentists are not considered to be frequent prescribers of antibiotics. However, few studies have identified how much, and in which situations, dentists prescribe such drugs. The aims of the present study were to survey Norwegian dentists' antibiotic-prescribing habits in 2015 and to compare the findings with previous studies (1990 and 2004) and with the actual numbers of dispensed prescriptions obtained from the 'Norwegian National Prescription Register'. The results from 1990 to 2004 show that there was a general increase in antibiotic prescriptions by Norwegian dentists, followed by a reduction or flattening of the prescription volume curve from 2004 to 2015. Despite this, possibilities for further improvements have been identified and recommendations given for targeted campaigns to reduce the prescription volume in dentistry by a further 30%, which has been ordered by the Norwegian National Assembly."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Eur J Oral Sci."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6516-6621"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Institute of Clinical Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Preus", "ForeName": "Hans R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Institute of Clinical Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Fredriksen", "ForeName": "Karen W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Institute of Clinical Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Vogsland", "ForeName": "Andrea E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Institute of Clinical Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Sandvik", "ForeName": "Leiv", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Institute of Clinical Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Grytten", "ForeName": "Jostein I", "Initials": "JI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Oral Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9504563", "ISSNLinking": "0909-8836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Practice Patterns, Dentists'"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28653438", "10.1111/eos.12360"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
