However, changes in pollutant profiles are expected due to increasing urbanisation and commercial-industrial activities. This study aims to determine the variation of surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration recorded at seven selected stations in Malaysian Borneo. Hourly surface O<sub>3</sub> data covering the period 2002 to 2013, obtained from the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE), were analysed using statistical methods. The results show that the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> recorded in Malaysian Borneo during the study period were below the maximum Malaysian Air Quality Standard of 100ppbv. The hourly average and maximum O<sub>3</sub> concentrations of 31 and 92ppbv reported at Bintulu (S3) respectively were the highest among the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations recorded at the sampling stations. Further investigation on O<sub>3</sub> precursors show that sampling sites located near to local petrochemical industrial activities, such as Bintulu (S3) and Miri (S4), have higher NO<sub>2</sub>/NO ratios (between 3.21 and 5.67) compared to other stations. The normalised O<sub>3</sub> values recorded at all stations were higher during the weekend compared to weekdays (unlike its precursors) which suggests the influence of O<sub>3</sub> titration by NO during weekdays. The results also show that there are distinct seasonal variations in O<sub>3</sub> across Borneo. High surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were usually observed between August and September at all stations with the exception of station S7 on the east coast. Majority of the stations (except S1 and S6) have recorded increasing averaged maximum concentrations of surface O<sub>3</sub> over the analysed years. Increasing trends of NO<sub>2</sub> and decreasing trends of NO influence the yearly averaged maximum of O<sub>3</sub> especially at S3. This study also shows that variations of meteorological factors such as wind speed and direction, humidity and temperature influence the concentration of surface O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
