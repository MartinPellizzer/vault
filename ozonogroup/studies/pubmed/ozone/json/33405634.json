The streamer-surface discharge generates abundant energetic species, atomic oxygen at the plasma-oil interface. The otherwise challenging dissociation of C\u2550C double bonds by energetic species and oxidation by the plasma generated atomic oxygen is the key mechanism to produce the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> active species and carboxylic acid in the PAO. It is shown that the peroxide value and acid value of PAO are 7.5 times and 57% higher than those of the traditional ozonated oil, respectively. Different from plasma activated water whose shelf life was less than 1 week, PAO could be stored at room temperature for at least 3 months, and a shelf life of up to 1 year is expected. We further reveal that the PAO can not only sterilize the wound, but also promote more release of growth factor such as VEGF and CD34; therefore, the wound healing of PAO is 28.5% faster than that of the control group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, WuHan, HuBei 430074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IFSA Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Xianyun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, WuHan, HuBei 430074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IFSA Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Maoyuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, WuHan, HuBei 430074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IFSA Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Shuhui", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hongxiang", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, WuHan, HuBei 430074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IFSA Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dawei", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, WuHan, HuBei 430074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IFSA Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xinpei", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Future Environments and Institute for Health and Biomedical Innovation, School of Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland 4000, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO-QUT Joint Sustainable Processes and Devices Laboratory, P.O.
