World Health Organization (WHO) termed the infection as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) after phylogenic studies with SARS-CoV. The virus causes severe respiratory infections with dry cough, high fever, body ache and fatigue. The virus is primarily transmitted among people through respiratory droplets from COVID-19 infected person. WHO declared this COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and since February, 2020 affected countries have locked down their cities, industries and restricted the movement of their citizens to minimize the spread of the virus. In spite of the negative aspects of coronavirus on the globe, the coronavirus crises brought a positive impact on the natural environment. Countries where the movement of citizens was seized to stop the spread of coronavirus infection have experienced a noticeable decline in pollution and greenhouse gases emission. Recent research also indicated that this COVID-19-induced lockdown has reduced the environmental pollution drastically worldwide. In this review, we have discussed some important positive impacts of coronavirus on environmental quality by compiling the recently published data from research articles, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Islamic Azad University (IAU) 2020."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.54549.39", "0000 0004 0369 4060"], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.440522.5", "0000 0004 0478 6450"], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government Degree College No. 2 Mardan, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.440522.5", "0000 0004 0478 6450"], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government Degree College No. 2 Mardan, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran)", "NlmUniqueID": "101275885", "ISSNLinking": "1735-1472"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "CAT-Climate Action Tracker (2020) Climate of China. https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/.
