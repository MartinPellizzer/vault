Ferric salt addition enhanced 1,4-dioxane degradation at an electrolytic current of 0.100 A. By contrast, an inhibitory effect of ferric salt addition was observed at a current of 0.500 A. The enhanced accumulation of free chlorine at a current of 0.500 A directly decreased the 1,4-dioxane degradation rate by scavenging reactive radicals like HO\u02d9 and Cl\u02d9. However, at an electrolytic current of 0.100 A, UV irradiance was relatively excessive for electrochemical chlorine production. The excess UV energy enhanced the photoreduction of FeOH<sup>2+</sup>, followed by the Fenton-type reaction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and HOCl, which produced HO\u02d9 and consumed free chlorine. As a result, the free chlorine concentration decreased, and the reaction efficiency between the reactive radicals and 1,4-dioxane improved. Thus, the addition of ferric salt to a UV/electro-chlorine system is recommended when the UV irradiance in the system is excessive compared to the electrochemical chlorine supply."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2305-686X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kishimoto", "ForeName": "Naoyuki", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Kenjiro", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37955858", "10.1080/09593330.2023.2283800"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
