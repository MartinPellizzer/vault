Venlafaxine (VLX), an environmentally relevant tertiary amine-containing TrOC, was chosen as the model for this study. TP analysis confirmed that the lone electron pair of the non-protonated amine are the predominant site of oxidant attack, and therefore strongly affected by pH value and VLX speciation. N-oxide VLX (NOV), the primary ozone-induced TP, was formed and degraded simultaneously during ozonation of VLX-containing secondary effluent and reached a maximum yield of 0.44 to 0.85 (NOV-to-VLX<sub>0</sub> ratio), depending on pH and hydroxyl (OH) radical presence. Rate constants for the reaction of NOV with ozone (3.1\u00d710<sup>2</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) and OH radicals (5.3\u00d710<sup>9</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) were determined. A simple kinetic model was developed to fit the kinetics of formation and degradation of NOV during ozonation in secondary effluents, based on a known ozone-reaction kinetic equation. The biodegradability of NOV (degradation rate of 39%) was significantly lower than that of the parent compound (VLX, 92%) after 71days, as evaluated by modified Zahn-Wellens tests, suggesting that N-oxide products are not better removed than the parent compound in a simulated biological post-treatment, which may even result in partial reformation of the parent compound. Lessons learned from this study were supported by a pilot-scale demonstration at the Shafdan wastewater-treatment plant, confirming the presence of NOV after ozonation and its persistence in biological post-treatment. Removal of such persistent TP will require higher dosages or promotion of OH-radicals during ozonation. Nevertheless, further assessment of the toxicity of persistent TPs relative to the parent compound is needed for complete evaluation of concerned TPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
