NOx concentrations directly influence the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere through interactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals. The main sink of NOx is the formation and deposition of nitric acid, a component of acid rain and a bioavailable nutrient. NOx is emitted from a mixture of natural and anthropogenic sources, which vary in space and time. The collocation of multiple sources and the short lifetime of NOx make it challenging to quantitatively constrain the influence of different emission sources and their impacts on the environment. Nitrogen isotopes of NOx have been suggested to vary amongst different sources, representing a potentially powerful tool to understand the sources and transport of NOx. However, previous methods of collecting atmospheric NOx integrate over long (week to month) time spans and are not validated for the efficient collection of NOx in relevant, diverse field conditions. We report on a new, highly efficient field-based system that collects atmospheric NOx for isotope analysis at a time resolution between 30 min and 2 hr. This method collects gaseous NOx in solution as nitrate with 100% efficiency under a variety of conditions. Protocols are presented for collecting air in urban settings under both stationary and mobile conditions. We detail the advantages and limitations of the method and demonstrate its application in the field. Data from several deployments are shown to 1) evaluate field-based collection efficiency by comparisons with in situ NOx concentration measurements, 2) test the stability of stored solutions before processing, 3) quantify in situ reproducibility in a variety of urban settings, and 4) demonstrate the range of N isotopes of NOx detected in ambient urban air and on heavily traveled roadways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Brown University; Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, Brown University."}], "LastName": "Wojtal", "ForeName": "Paul K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, Brown University; Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Brown University."}], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "David J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Brown University."}], "LastName": "O'Conner", "ForeName": "Mary", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, Brown University; Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Brown University."}], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "Sydney C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, Brown University; Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Brown University; meredith_hastings@brown.edu."}], "LastName": "Hastings", "ForeName": "Meredith G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Automation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Galloway JN, et al.
