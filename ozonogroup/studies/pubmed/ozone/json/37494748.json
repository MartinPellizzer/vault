It is difficult to determine the dosage of each disinfectant because of the complex interactions that occur between disinfection units and the complicated mathematical calculation required. In this study, we proposed a dosage optimization model for ozone-UV-chlorine synergistic disinfection process. The model was able to identify the cost-effective doses of the disinfectants under the constraints of microbial inactivation, decolorization, and residual chlorine retention requirements. Specifically, the simulation of microbial inactivation rates during synergistic disinfection process was accomplished through quantification of the synergistic effects between disinfection units and the introduction of enhancement coefficients. In order to solve this optimization model rapidly and automatically, a MATLAB-based software program with graphical user interface was developed. This software consisted of calibration unit, prediction unit, assessment unit, and optimization unit, and was able to simulate synergistic ozone-UV-chlorine process and identify the optimal dose of ozone, UV, and chlorine. Validation experiments revealed good agreements between the experimental data and the results calculated by the developed software. The developed software is believed to help the water reclamation plants improve disinfection efficiency and reduce the operational costs of synergistic disinfection processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
