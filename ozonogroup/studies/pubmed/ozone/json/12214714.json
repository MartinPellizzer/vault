It is the first systematic attempt to determine the VHC levels in the Athens' atmosphere with the very well known photochemical pollution problems. The purpose of this work was to create a database concerning VHCs in order to evaluate the photochemical pollution in this area (ozone creation, case studies and meteorology). Totally, 308 samples were collected at three different sites used in the state-monitoring programme involving the criteria pollutants. Air samples were collected on Tenax TA tubes and analysed by thermal desorption and dual column GC dual FID. Fifteen selected compounds were studied; 6 alkanes and 9 benzenoid compounds. The measured values of individual alkanes ranged from 0.39 pg m(-3) to 33 pg m(-3), and those of aromatics from 0.20 pg m(-3) to 616 pg m(-3). The sum of all 15 VHC concentrations ranged between 16 and 1697 pg m(-3). The time and spatial variations in the concentration of these compounds were assessed. Volatile hydrocarbons exhibited a clear seasonal and time cycle, showing higher concentrations during winter and early morning hours. Study of the spatial variations of VHC levels showed higher concentrations at the center of the city. The variation of toluene/benzene ratio and the correlation between VHCs, criteria pollutants (CO, NOx and O3) and meteorological parameters were also assessed. It was demonstrated that a trip-line of the VHCs concentration at the city center doubles the ozone concentration at peripheral areas under favourable meteorological conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, Zografos, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bakeas", "ForeName": "Evangelos B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siskos", "ForeName": "Panayotis A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nature. 2000 Mar 9;404(6774):141-2", "ArticleIdList": ["10724154"]}, {"Citation": "WHO Reg Publ Eur Ser. 2000;(91):V-X, 1-273", "ArticleIdList": ["11372513"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 1998 Jan;48(1):16-25", "ArticleIdList": ["15655994"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12214714", "10.1007/BF02987497"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
