Despite of significant decreases in gaseous pollutants, such as SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, the enhancement of secondary aerosol formation was observed. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> has surpassed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and OM to become the dominant PM<sub>2.5</sub> component. We find that the reduction of POC mainly dominated the decreasing trend of OC. As for secondary inorganic components, the key processes or factors controlling the spatial-temporal variation characteristics were different. The areas with large SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations corresponded well to those with high SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, while the synchronized NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> better followed spatial patterns in O<sub>3</sub> than NO<sub>2</sub>. From 2016 to 2020, the response of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to SO<sub>2</sub> was close to a linear function, while the reaction of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to the decrease of NO<sub>2</sub> displayed nonlinear behavior. Such different relationships indicated that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was predominantly controlled by SO<sub>2</sub>, while NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was not only related to NO<sub>2</sub> but also determined by the secondary conversion process. The ratios of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and OC to EC between 2016 and 2020 were generally higher than 1 in typical BTH cities, and the ratio of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to EC was exceptionally high, with a range reaching up to 200 %. Besides, this ratio coincided well with the enhancement of O<sub>x</sub>, indicating the potential role of O<sub>x</sub> to secondary NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation. The diurnal cycle of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> concentration change rate indicated that the relative increase of O<sub>3</sub> during nighttime may offset the effectiveness of NO<sub>X</sub> emission reduction. This study provided observational evidence of enhanced secondary NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation with the rising trend of atmospheric oxidation and emphasized the importance of nighttime chemistry for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation in the BTH region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
