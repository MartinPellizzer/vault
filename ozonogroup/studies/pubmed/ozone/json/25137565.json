PET was oxidized and thus carboxylic and hydroxyl functional groups were introduced on its surface after O3 treatment, regardless of the presence or absence of Ca(2+) . In the case of O3 treatment with Ca(2+) , PET surface was modified with Ca(2+) . Ca(2+) immobilization was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectrometric analysis. Hydrophilicity was investigated by measuring contact angles (CA). CA of PET decreased significantly after ozonation. Surface topography of PET before and after ozone treatment was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and showed no morphological changes. In vitro studies showed enhanced rat bone marrow cell responses on the O3 -treated PET surface. Ca(2+) -O3 oxidation at 37\u00b0C for 6 h is expected to be an effective method to fabricate PET with good biocompatibility."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Ahmed Nafis", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsuru", "ForeName": "Kanji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ishikawa", "ForeName": "Kunio", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biomed Mater Res B Appl Biomater", "NlmUniqueID": "101234238", "ISSNLinking": "1552-4973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Terephthalates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Terephthalates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25137565", "10.1002/jbm.b.33260"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
