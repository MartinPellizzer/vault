Prior to introduction of the AQI, only a handful of metropolitan areas reported on air quality, and each region decided on its own metric. The inception of a single AQI helped homogenize the air quality metrics across the nation and indeed served as an important future template for other governmental and regulatory agencies across the world. The formulators had the foresight to recognize that our understanding of air pollution and its effects may change over time, which are likely to change regulatory limits. They used a dynamic framework to define the AQI, such that the broad definition or principle does not need to change with every change in regulatory limits or policy, and the fundamental goal of alerting the public to deleterious air quality is not affected. The establishment of the AQI increased public awareness of the importance of clean air and has helped muster support for air quality and emission regulations. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set forth by the USEPA provides acceptable levels of criteria pollutants - namely carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. A comparison of the actual levels, as compared to the regulatory limits (since the cessation of leaded gasoline, lead is no longer included in the index), are used as the basis for the AQI. As the regulatory limits change, so does the exact evaluation of the AQI, making it a living index. In this paper, we provide a historical overview of the Air Quality Index, the Federal Reference Methods (FRMs) vs. Federal Equivalent Methods (FEMs) for measuring them, and as an illustrative example, we discuss the air quality for Dallas-Ft. Worth, currently the fourth most populous metropolitan region in the United States, vis-a-vis the reported AQI."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
