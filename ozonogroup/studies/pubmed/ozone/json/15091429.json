The control seedlings were exposed to charcoal-filtered air and simulated rain of pH 6.8 during the same period. Significant interactive effects of O(3) and simulated acid rain on whole plant net photosynthetic rate were observed, but not on other determined parameters. The exposure of the seedlings to O(3) caused the reductions in the dry weight growth, root dry weight relative to the whole plant dry weight, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate in light, water-use efficiency and root respiration activity, and increases in shoot/root ratio, and leaf dry weight relative to the whole plant dry weight without an appearance of acute visible foliar injury, but did not affect the dark respiration rate and transpiration rate in the darkness. The decreased net photosynthetic rate was considered to be the major cause for the growth reduction of the seedlings exposed to O(3). On the other hand, the exposure of the seedlings to simulated acid rain reduced the net photosynthetic rate per unit chlorophyll a + b content, but did not induce the significant change in other determined parameters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The United Graduate School, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izuta", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aoki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Totsuka", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091429", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)00039-9", "0269749195000399"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
