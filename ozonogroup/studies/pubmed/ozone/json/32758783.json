This is the first and only study reporting the occurrence of all these non-halogenated aldehydes (NON-HALs) and haloacetaldehydes (HALs) simultaneously, based on the multi-point monitoring of water in full-scale conditions from source to distribution network. In general, the application of both post-ozonation and liquid chlorine contributed to the formation of OBPs (aldehydes and bromate). NON-HALs were present in higher concentrations than HALs. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal were the most common forms of NON-HALs in the two water systems that were studied. Chloral hydrate (CH), the hydrated form of trichloroacetaldehyde, was the most dominant HAL observed. The nature of the organic matter and the water temperature proved to be important parameters for explaining the variability of aldehydes. Summer and autumn (warm seasons) were more favorable for the formation of chloral hydrate and bromate. The highest concentrations of NON-HALs were observed in spring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
