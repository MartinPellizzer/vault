Diesel engine exhaust (DE) and O(3) generate substantial inflammatory effects in the airways. However, as yet it has not been determined whether a subsequent O(3) exposure would add to the diesel-induced airway inflammatory effects. Healthy subjects underwent two separate exposure series: A 1-h DE exposure at a PM-concentration of 300 microg/m(3), followed after 5h by a 2-h exposure to filtered air and 0.2 ppm O(3), respectively. Induced sputum was collected 18 h after the second exposure. A significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils (PMN) and concentration of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was seen in sputum post DE+O(3) vs. DE+air (p<0.05 and <0.05, respectively). Significant associations were observed between the responses in MPO concentration and total PMN cells (p=0.001), and also between MPO and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (p<0.001). The significant increase of PMN and MPO after the DE+O(3) exposures, compared to DE+air, denotes an O(3)-induced magnification of the DE-induced inflammation. Furthermore, the correlation between responses in MPO and number of PMNs and MMP-9 illustrate that the PMNs are activated, resulting in a more potent inflammatory response. The present study indicates that O(3) exposure adds significantly to the inflammatory response that is established by diesel exhaust. This interaction between exposure to particulate pollution and O(3) in sequence should be taken into consideration when health effects of air pollution are considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, University Hospital, SE-901 85 Ume\u00e5, Sweden. jenny.bosson@lung.umu.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bosson", "ForeName": "Jenny", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pourazar", "ForeName": "Jamshid", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forsberg", "ForeName": "Bertil", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adelroth", "ForeName": "Ellinor", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blomberg", "ForeName": "Anders", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Respir Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8908438", "ISSNLinking": "0954-6111"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophil Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Sputum"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17196810", "10.1016/j.rmed.2006.11.010", "S0954-6111(06)00597-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
