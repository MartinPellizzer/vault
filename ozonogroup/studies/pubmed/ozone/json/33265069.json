In this study, a new analytical method was developed to identify new brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs) during ozonation, using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-single quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-qMS) connected with an electron capture detector in parallel. The obtained data were analyzed using a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) difference extraction method. Over 1304 DBPs were detected in an ozonated phenylalanine solution. Further screening of 635 DBPs was conducted using the m/z difference extraction method. Finally, the structures for 12 Br-DBPs were confirmed and for 4 Br-DBPs were tentatively proposed by comparison with the NIST library and standard compounds. Eight of the confirmed Br-DBPs are first reported and identified: 2-bromostyrene, 1-bromo-1-phenylethylene, 2-bromobenzaldehyde, 3-bromobenzaldehyde, 4-bromobenzaldehyde, 2-bromophenylacetonitrile, 3-bromophenylacetonitrile and 4-bromophenylacetonitrile. These DBPs and 2,4,6-tribromophenol were detected at nanogram- to microgram-per-liter concentrations during ozonation of authentic water samples like algal bloom waters, wastewater treatment plant effluents, and surface water. The toxicities of these compounds were generally higher than that of bromate. The developed analytical method is a powerful technique for analyzing complex compounds and provides a novel way of identifying byproducts in future studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
