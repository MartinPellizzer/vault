We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect and to account for both within- and between-study heterogeneity. Then, we applied a model selection (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to assess the modifier variables, and, lastly, we performed meta-regression analyses to evaluate the modifier variables contributing to heterogeneity among studies.", "We assessed 2183 studies, of which we selected 529 for in-depth review, and 70 articles fulfilled our study inclusion criteria. The 70 studies selected for meta-analysis encompass more than 30 million events across 28 countries. We found positive associations between cardiorespiratory diseases and different air pollutants. For example, when we considered only the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and respiratory diseases ( Figure 1 , we observed a risk equal to 2.7% (95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20090.9%, 7.7%). Our results showed statistical significance in the test of moderators for all pollutants, suggesting that the modifier variables influence the average cardiorespiratory disease risk and may explain the varying effects of air pollution.", "Variables related to aspects of energy, transportation, and socioeconomic status may explain the varying effect size of the association between air pollution and cardiorespiratory diseases. Public Health Implications. Our study provides a transferable model to estimate the health effects of air pollutants to support the creation of environmental health public policies for national and international intervention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Weeberb J.
