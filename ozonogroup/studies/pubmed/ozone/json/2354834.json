Ozone exposure (3 ppm, 2 hr) markedly increased airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine without affecting basal respiratory resistance. Although ozone also caused a slight but significant increase in neutrophil number in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, there was no correlation between the level of airway hyperresponsiveness and increased neutrophil number. Although OKY-046 significantly inhibited the increases in airway hyperresponsiveness in a dose-dependent manner at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg, p.o., the compound did not affect the basal airway responsiveness and respiratory resistance at 300 mg/kg, p.o. Inhalation of the subthreshold concentration (i.e., the highest dose which did not cause bronchoconstriction) of STA2 (a stable TxA2 mimetic agent) elicited a significant increase in airway responsiveness to methacholine. These results suggest that TxA2 may play a role in mediating ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. However, the accumulation of neutrophils in the airway lumen may not be essential for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nambu", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adachi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacrylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57576-52-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane A2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.99.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane-A Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L256JB984D", "NameOfSubstance": "ozagrel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Acrylates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Methacrylates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane A2"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane-A Synthase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2354834", "10.1254/fpj.95.5_271"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
