Rats were infected with aerosols of S. aureus and then exposed for 5 hr to 2.5 ppm of ozone. Left lungs were cultured for staphylococci; right lungs were stained for lysozyme and bacteria. Compared with control animals, rats exposed to ozone showed diminished rates of bacterial killing; a larger percentage of extracellular, uningested bacteria; an increased number of intracellular staphylococcal clumps; and absence of lysozyme in macrophages permitting staphylococcal proliferation. These results, in which absence of enzyme activity occurred in macrophages subjected to the dual insults of ozone exposure and ingested bacteria, provide an explanation for the inability of phagocytes to kill ingested bacteria after exposure to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-01327", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Infect Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0413675", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Muramidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Muramidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcal Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7217720", "10.1093/infdis/143.2.247"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
