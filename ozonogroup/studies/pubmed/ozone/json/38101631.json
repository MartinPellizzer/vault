Data was acquired pertaining to the health status and environmental exposure of the children in their homes. Personal exposure to outdoor air pollutants at the residential address during the preconceptional, perinatal, and postnatal periods was computed using data from ten air quality monitoring stations. An analysis of the relationships between childhood PIs and both indoor and outdoor factors was conducted using a multiple logistic regression model.", "Childhood PIs were associated with outdoor CO and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure during the 10th-12th months prior to pregnancy, with ORs (95\u00a0% CI) of 1.68 (1.24-2.27) and 1.60 (1.15-2.22), respectively; childhood PIs were also associated with CO exposure during one year prior to pregnancy and the first trimester in utero [ORs\u00a0=\u00a01.57 (1.14-2.15) and 1.52 (1.17-1.97)]. Childhood PIs were found to be associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during pregnancy and the first year, with odds ratios of 1.51 (1.14-2.00) and 1.95 (1.22-3.12) per IQR increase in pollutant exposure, respectively. Exposures to smoke, renovation-related indoor air pollution (IAP), dampness and plant-related indoor allergens in the early life and past year were all associated with childhood PI, with odds ratios (95\u00a0% CI) ranging from 1.40 (1.01-1.95) for environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during pregnancy to 1.63 (1.12-2.37) for mold/damp stains in the past year. In terms of PI risk, the early life and present periods were critical time windows for outdoor and indoor exposures, respectively. Certain individuals were more vulnerable to the PI risk associated with both indoor and outdoor exposures. Antibiotic use during child's lifetime and early years increased and decreased the PI risk of exposure to outdoor and indoor environments, respectively.", "Exposure to outdoor air pollution in early life and indoor environments in the past year were found to be associated with childhood PI."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
