The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the Effective Activity concept for predicting water quality in biofiltration systems. This pilot-scale study evaluated eight different biofilter configurations in order to quantify impacts associated with filter media (anthracite/sand or granular activated carbon), pre-treatment (settled water with or without ozonation) and operating conditions (15- and 30-min EBCT, and backwash with or without chlorine). Microbial characterization included biomass concentration, as measured by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in addition to esterase and phosphatase activity. Water quality parameters included dissolved organic carbon (DOC), trihalomethane (THM) formation potential (FP), haloacetic acid (HAA) FP, haloacetonitrile (HAN) FP, iodinated DBP FP (THMs and HAAs) and inorganic nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen). Results confirmed the benefits to treated water quality associated with the application of an ozone residual of 0.5\u00a0mg/L, utilization of GAC filter media, eliminating chlorinated backwash, and extending EBCT. This study demonstrated a good relationship between effective esterase activity and reductions in DOC and THM FP, including those systems which incorporate pre-ozonation. As such, this study showed that Effective Activity may be appropriate for relating biomass characterization to treated water quality and highlights the importance of quantifying biomass activity in addition to quantity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
