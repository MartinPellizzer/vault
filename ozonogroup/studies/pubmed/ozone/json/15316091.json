Cholesterol is an abundant component of this epithelial lining fluid, and it is susceptible to ozonolysis, yielding several stable products including 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al and 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol. Both 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol and its metabolite, cholestan-6-oxo-3,5-diol, have been shown to cause cytotoxicity in vitro, suggesting that they may be potential mediators of ozone toxicity in vivo. An ozone-sensitive mouse strain, C57BL/6J, was exposed to varying concentrations of ozone (0.5-3.0 ppm), and subsequently the levels of these cholesterol ozonolysis products were quantitated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lavaged cells, and lung homogenate. An ozone dose-dependent formation of these biologically active oxysterols was observed in vivo, supporting a role for these compounds in ozone toxicity. Since the 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol metabolite, cholestan-6-oxo-3,5-diol, was isobaric with other cholesterol ozonolysis products, 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al and its aldol condensation product, 3beta-hydroxy-5beta-hydroxy-B-norcholestan-6beta-carboxaldehyde, detailed mass spectral analysis using electron impact ionization was utilized to differentiate these isobaric cholesterol ozonolysis products. The specific detection of cholestan-6-oxo-3,5-diol in lung homogenate after ozone exposure established formation of 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol within the lung after exposure to 0.5 ppm ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cell Biology, Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pulfer", "ForeName": "Melissa K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taube", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gelfand", "ForeName": "Erwin", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "Robert C", "Initials": "RC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES012347", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL34303", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacol Exp Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0376362", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sterols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sterols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15316091", "10.1124/jpet.104.073437", "jpet.104.073437"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
