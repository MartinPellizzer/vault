The final sample included 979,306 births for PTB analysis and 888,133 for TLBW analysis. Exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were based on date of birth and estimated for the entire gestation and for each trimester. Multilevel logistic regression models were conducted to examine the effect of air pollutants on both adverse birth outcomes and whether it was modified by individual and area-level SES.", "In fully adjusted models, over the entire pregnancy, a 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> was associated with increased chance of PTB (odds ratio; OR\u00a0=\u00a01.14 CI 1.13, 1.16 and 1.08 CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 1.15 respectively) and PM<sub>10</sub> with TLBW (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.08 CI 1.03, 1.14). Associations were modified by maternal educational and area-level SES for both outcomes. Mothers of lower education had an additional chance of PTB and TLBW due to PM<sub>10</sub> exposure (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.04 CI 1.04, 1.05 and 1.10 CI 1.08, 1.14 respectively), while mothers living in low SES areas have an additional chance for TLBW (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.05 CI 1.03, 1.06). Similar modification effects were found for O<sub>3</sub> exposure.
