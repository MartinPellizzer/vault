This study involves the rapid chemical profiling of phenolic and diterpene resin acids in needles of two (ozone-tolerant and ozone-sensitive) white pine (Pinus strobus) clones, fumigated with different ozone levels (control, and daily events peaking at 80 and 200 ppb) for 40 days. The phenolic and resin acids were measured using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Short-term fumigation affected the levels of two phenolic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids, in that both showed a substantial decrease in concentration with increased ozone dose. The decrease in concentration of these THM products may be caused by inhibition of the plant's shikimate biochemical pathway caused by ozone exposure. The combined occurrence of these two ozone-sensitive indicators has a role in biomonitoring of ozone levels and its impact on forest productivity. In addition, chromatographic profile differences in the major diterpene resin acid components were observed between ozone-tolerant and ozone-sensitive clones. The resin acids anticopalic, 3-oxoanticopalic, 3beta-hydroxyanticopalic, and 3,4-cycloanticopalic acids were present in the ozone-sensitive pine; however, only anticopalic acid was present in the ozone-tolerant clone. This phenotypic variation in resin acid composition may be useful in distinguishing populations that are differentially adapted to air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL A1B 3X7, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shadkami", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Helleur", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "7505563", "ISSNLinking": "0098-0331"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1999;100(1-3):19-42", "ArticleIdList": ["15093111"]}, {"Citation": "Trends Plant Sci. 1999 May;4(5):184-190", "ArticleIdList": ["10322558"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1998 May;114(4):455-460", "ArticleIdList": ["28307894"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1991 Mar;17(3):505-13", "ArticleIdList": ["24258801"]}, {"Citation": "New Phytol. 1996 Mar;132(3):483-92", "ArticleIdList": ["26763644"]}, {"Citation": "J Anal Appl Pyrolysis. 2001 Nov;61(1):65-89", "ArticleIdList": ["32287530"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1994 Jan;104(1):67-74", "ArticleIdList": ["12232062"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Dec;97(4):1280-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16668544"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17562110", "10.1007/s10886-007-9314-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
