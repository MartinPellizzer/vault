A control group (n=75) of participants with denture-related traumatic ulcers who matched the study group in sex and age were also recruited. Ulcers were treated with ozone gas for 60 seconds in the study group and with air for 60 seconds in the control group. Pain levels were evaluated by means of a visual analog scale (VAS), and ulcer sizes were measured in each participant at experiment baseline and each day for 15 days. Ulcer duration was established by calculating the period it took to completely heal and disappear. Major outcome measurements were ulcer duration, ulcer size, and levels of pain.", "Ulcer size decreased from day 2 in the study group (after ozone application) (P\u2264.01) and from day 4 in the controls (P\u2264.001).
