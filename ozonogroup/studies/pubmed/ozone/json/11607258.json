Their physical and chemical properties made them an integral part of manufacturing processes for electronics products. The recognition that CFCs destroy the stratospheric ozone layer, with consequent enormous consequences to all forms of life on earth, has led to international agreements which will end virtually all possibly before. This impending phaseout of CFCs has caused electronics manufacturers to examine alternative chemicals and processing methods. This manuscript documents the steps AT&T has taken to reach its goal of 100% phaseout of CFCs by years-end 1994. These actions include top-down management support with combined bottom-up thrusts, an internal information gathering and dissemination center, internal technology transfer, and external corporate activism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AT&T-Environmental and Safety Engineering, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boyhan", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11607258", "PMC48331", "10.1073/pnas.89.3.812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
