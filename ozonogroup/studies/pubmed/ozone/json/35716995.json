Following a single treatment session, the lesions completely disappeared after three weeks and did not reappear during the two-year follow-up. Photodynamic therapy has been reported to be successful for plantar warts with a low recurrence rate, while ozone water is an emerging treatment for infectious skin diseases, which can modulate immunity without obvious side effects. Pretreatment with ozone water and superficial shaving before PDT is a potential new strategy for treating recalcitrant and large plantar warts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
