According to a recent paper reported by Hasson et al., [J. Phys. Chem., 2004, 108, 5979-5989] this reaction may proceed by three different channels: CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--> CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (1a); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--> CH(3)C(O)OH + O(3) (1b); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--> CH(3)C(O)O + OH + O(2) (1c). In experiments, CH(3)C(O)O(2) and HO(2) radicals were generated using Cl-initiated oxidation of acetaldehyde and methanol, respectively, in the presence of oxygen. The addition of amounts of benzene in the system, forming hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals in the presence of OH, allowed us to answer that channel (1c) is <10%. The rate constant k(1) of reaction (1) has been finally measured at (1.50 +/- 0.08) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K, after having considered the combination of all the possible values for the branching ratios k(1a)/k(1,)k(1b)/k(1,)k(1c)/k(1) and has been compared to previous measurements. The branching ratio k(1b)/k(1), determined by measuring ozone in situ, was found to be equal to (20 +/- 1)%, a value consistent with the previous values reported in the literature. DFT calculations show that channel (1c) is also of minor importance: it was deduced unambiguously that the formation of CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (X (3)Sigma(-)(g)) is the dominant product channel, followed by the second channel (1b) leading to CH(3)C(O)OH and singlet O(3) and, much less importantly, channel (1c) which corresponds to OH formation. These conclusions give a reliable explanation of the experimental observations of this work. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2) is still predominantly a radical chain termination reaction in the tropospheric ozone chain formation processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physico-Chimie Mol\u00e9culaire, CNRS UMR 5803, Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux I, 33405, Talence Cedex, France. e.villenave@lpcm.u-bordeaux1.fr."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le Cr\u00e2ne", "ForeName": "Jean-Paul", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rayez", "ForeName": "Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rayez", "ForeName": "Jean-Claude", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Villenave", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GO1N1ZPR3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16751874", "10.1039/b518321a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
