The results showed that VOCs emissions of packaging and printing were mainly composed of OVOC \uff0860.9%\uff09. In terms of the industrial coating, aromatic hydrocarbons \uff0842.4%\uff09 and OVOC \uff0838.9%\uff09 were the main VOCs species. The emissions of the footwear, furniture manufacturing, and paper industries were mainly composed of OVOC \uff0832.3% - 42.6%\uff09 and aromatic hydrocarbons \uff0820.7% - 33.7%\uff09, with noticeable halogenated hydrocarbons. Chemical and pharmaceutical industries mainly emitted halogenated hydrocarbons, with the proportions of 59.3% and 46.6%, respectively. The emissions of the brick industry were primarily composed of alkane \uff0862.7%\uff09, and OVOC \uff0848.5%\uff09, and halogenated hydrocarbons \uff0819.7%\uff09 were the main contributors to VOCs emissions of the thermal industry. OVOC \uff0848.1%\uff09 and alkane \uff0829.4%\uff09 were the dominant species for the food manufacturing industry. In the packaging and printing industry, acetone \uff0814.8%\uff09, isopropanol \uff0814.0%\uff09, ethylacetate \uff0811.1%\uff09, and toluene \uff0810.2%\uff09 were the characteristic VOCs species. The emissions of industrial coating were dominated by isopropanol \uff0825.6%\uff09, toluene \uff0815.0%\uff09, <i>m/p</i>-xylene \uff0812.4%\uff09, and acetone \uff087.1%\uff09. In the furniture manufacturing industry, <i>m/p</i>-xylene \uff0815.8%\uff09, followed by hexanal \uff0815.1%\uff09, 1,2-dichloroethane \uff089.6%\uff09, and acetone \uff088.4%\uff09 were the characteristic VOCs species. The emissions of the footwear industry were dominated by acetone \uff0818.9%\uff09, toluene \uff0818.1%\uff09, methylene chloride \uff088.0%\uff09, and acetaldehyde \uff086.8%\uff09. The characteristic species of the chemical industry were methylene chloride \uff0823.9%\uff09, 1,2-dichloroethane \uff0814.7%\uff09, acetone \uff0812.7%\uff09, and trichloromethane \uff0811.1%\uff09, and those for the pharmaceutical industry were bromoethane \uff0836.7%\uff09, acetone \uff0819.2%\uff09, benzene \uff085.0%\uff09, and vinyl acetate \uff083.0%\uff09. The emissions of the brick industry were mainly ethane, propane, ethylene, and benzene. Acetone, toluene, acetylene, and acetaldehyde were the primary VOCs species in the paper industry. The emissions of the food manufacturing industry were dominated by acetaldehyde, <i>n</i>-pentane, acrolein, and <i>n</i>-heptane. The emissions of the thermal industry were characterized by acetone, acetaldehyde , benzene, and toluene. Although different industries emitted various characteristic VOCs species, in general, acetone, isopropanol, benzene, toluene, <i>m/p</i>-xylene, ethane, acetaldehyde, and methylene chloride were the main characteristic species in most industries in Luohe. OVOC and aromatic hydrocarbons had higher contributions to ozone generation potential \uff08OFP\uff09, and aromatic hydrocarbons contributed over 80.0% to secondary organic aerosol formation potential \uff08SOAP\uff09. The source reactivity of ozone [SR\uff08O<sub>3</sub>\uff09] of the food and furniture manufacturing industries were higher, with values of 3.7 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup> and 3.5 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, whereas the source reactivity of secondary organic aerosol SR\uff08SOA\uff09 of the industrial coating, furniture manufacturing, and footwear industries were higher, with the values of 0.021, 0.017, and 0.014 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>. Hence, the food manufacturing, industrial coating, and furniture manufacturing industries should be the primary industries for the collaborative control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone in Luohe City, of which the furniture manufacturing industry was the top priority."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Tianjin Chengjian University, Tianjin 300384, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Yu-Bin", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Tianjin Chengjian University, Tianjin 300384, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Li-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Monitoring Center of Luohe City, Luohe 462000, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Da-Wei", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Leng", "ForeName": "Hai-Bin", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39168668", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202308177"]}}]}
