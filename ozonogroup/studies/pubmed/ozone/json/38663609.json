To gain insight into the impact and spatiotemporal characteristics of airborne pollutants in East Asian continental outflows, a versatile multicopter drone sounding platform was used to simultaneously observe PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and meteorological variables (temperature, specific humidity, pressure, and wind vector) above the northern tip of Taiwan, Cape Fuiguei, which often encounters continental outflows during winter monsoon periods. By coordinating hourly high-spatial-resolution profiles provided by drone soundings, WRF/CMAQ model air quality predictions, HYSPLIT-simulated backward trajectories, and MERRA-2 reanalysis data, we analyzed two prominent phenomena of airborne pollutants in continental outflows to better understand their physical/chemical characteristics. First, we found that pollutants were well mixed within a sounding height of 500\u00a0m when continental outflows passed through and completely enveloped Cape Fuiguei. Eddies induced by significant fluctuations in wind speeds coupled with minimal temperature inversion and LRT facilitated vertical mixing, possibly resulting in high homogeneity of pollutants within the outflow layer. Second, the drone soundings indicated exceptionally high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (70-100 ppbv) but relatively low concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (10-20\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), CO<sub>2</sub> (420-425 ppmv), and VOCs in some air masses. The low levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and VOCs ruled out photochemistry as the cause of the formation of high-level O<sub>3</sub>. Further coordination of spatiotemporal data with air mass trajectories and O<sub>3</sub> cross sections provided by MERRA-2 suggested that the high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations could be attributed to stratospheric intrusion and advection via continental outflows. High-level O<sub>3</sub> concentrations persisted in the lower troposphere, even reaching the surface, suggesting that stratospheric intrusion O<sub>3</sub> may be involved in the rising trend in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in parts of East Asia in recent years in addition to surface photochemical factors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
