However, their interactive effect on molecular biomarkers of aging (telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN)) remains unclear.", "This study was conducted among 6418 rural Chinese adults. The concentration of ambient ozone was assessed using a random forest model. Residential greenness was represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Molecular biomarkers of aging (relative TL and relative mtDNA-CN) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Generalized linear regression models were applied to investigate the independent and combined effects of ambient ozone and residential greenness on relative TL and relative mtDNA-CN.", "The estimated percent changes and 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs) of relative TL in response to per-unit increase in ambient ozone were -22.43\u00a0% (-23.74\u00a0%, -21.18\u00a0%), -14.19\u00a0% (-15.63\u00a0%, -12.72\u00a0%) and -4.50\u00a0% (-6.57\u00a0%, -2.27\u00a0%) for participants with low (NDVI\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.53), moderate (0.54-0.55) and high (\u22650.56) residential greenness exposure, respectively, while the corresponding figures of relative mtDNA-CN were -12.63\u00a0% (-13.84\u00a0%, -11.31\u00a0%), -9.52\u00a0% (-10.60\u00a0%, -8.33\u00a0%) and 2.12\u00a0% (0.20\u00a0%, 4.19\u00a0%). Furthermore, negative interactive effects between ambient ozone and residential greenness exposure on molecular biomarkers of aging were observed (P<sub>for interaction</sub>\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for relative TL, and 0.098 for relative mtDNA-CN).", "Long-term exposure to high concentrations of ambient ozone and low residential greenness was associated with decreased mtDNA-CN and shortened TL. The adverse effect of ambient ozone exposure on molecular biomarkers of aging may be attenuated by increased residential greenness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
