The quoted uncertainty includes two standard deviations from the least-squares regression, the systematic error from the GC analysis, and the uncertainties of the rate constants of the reference compounds. The OH-radical-initiated oxidation of cyc-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF\u2550CH- gives the main products COF<sub>2</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub>, leading to negligible environmental impact. For consumptions of cyc-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF\u2550CH- of less than 54%, the yield of the formation of ([COF<sub>2</sub>] + [CO] + [CO<sub>2</sub>])/5 (based on the conservation of carbon) was 0.99 \u00b1 0.02, which is very close to 100%. A possible degradation mechanism was proposed. The radiative efficiency (RE) of cyc-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF\u2550CH- measured at room temperature was 0.215 W m<sup>-2</sup> ppb<sup>-1</sup>. The atmospheric lifetime of cyc-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF\u2550CH- was calculated as 0.61 year, and the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) was negligible.
