However, the evidence on the association between O<sub>3</sub> and risks of chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains insufficient and inconsistent, particularly in developing countries where there is an absence of macroscopic investigations at a large population scale. Based on data from a representative nationwide cross-sectional CKD survey in 13 Chinese provinces and a high resolution O<sub>3</sub> air pollution inversion dataset, generalized linear models were used to evaluate the associations of O<sub>3</sub> concentration with prevalence of CKD. The results of this study suggested that long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure was positively associated with the risk of CKD. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with an increased odds of CKD prevalence [OR\u00a0=\u00a01.11 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.21)] among all the 47,086 participants. Stronger associations were found in urban regions, younger adults <65 years, and people with higher socio-economic status (income and education level). A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with a higher increased odds of CKD prevalence in urban regions [OR\u00a0=\u00a01.31 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.47)] compared to rural regions [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.95 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.08), P for subgroup difference<0.001]. A stronger association of O<sub>3</sub> concentration with CKD prevalence was found among younger people aged <65 years [OR\u00a0=\u00a01.21 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.33)] compared to those aged \u226565 years [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.92 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.07), P for subgroup difference\u00a0=\u00a00.003]. Our study demonstrated that long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure may increase risk of CKD in the general Chinese population, and the findings stressed the importance of persistent efforts in air pollution prevention and control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
