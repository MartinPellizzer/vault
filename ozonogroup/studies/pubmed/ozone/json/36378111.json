The development of new thermal ALD processes can be limited by precursor reactivity and stability: reaction temperature and precursor design are among the few variables available to achieve higher reactivity in gas-phase reactions, unlike in solution synthesis, where the use of solvent and/or a catalyst can promote a desired reaction. To bridge this synthesis gap between vapor-phase and solution-phase, we demonstrate the use of an ultrathin coating layer of a vapor phase-compatible solvent\u2500an ionic liquid (IL)\u2500on our growth substrate to perform ALD of SnO. Successful SnO deposition is achieved using tin acetylacetonate and water, a process that otherwise would require a stronger counter-reactant such as ozone. The presence of the layer of IL allows a solvent-mediated reaction mechanism to take place on the growth substrate surface. We report a growth per cycle of 0.67 \u00c5/cycle at a deposition temperature of 100 \u00b0C in an IL comprising 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate. Characterization of the ALD films confirms the SnO film composition, and <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR are used to probe the solvent-mediated ALD reaction, suggesting a solvent-mediated addition-elimination-type mechanism which breaks a C-C bond in acetylacetonate to form acetone and acetate. Density functional theory calculations show that the IL solvent is beneficial to the proposed solvent-mediated mechanism by lowering the C-C bond cleavage energetics of acetylacetonate compared to the vapor phase. A general class of ligand modification reactions for thermal ALD is thus introduced in this work."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5325-7315"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jingwei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "Seunggi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Schuster", "ForeName": "Nathaniel J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5393-2053"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyungjun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1084-5336"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Bent", "ForeName": "Stacey F", "Initials": "SF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36378111", "10.1021/jacs.2c10257"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
