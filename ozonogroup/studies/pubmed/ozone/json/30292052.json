This study employed rotating packed bed (RPB), an efficient process intensification device, as an ozone-disinfection contactor, and its performance on disinfection and mass transfer was evaluated by the inactivation of Escherichia coli (E.\u00a0coli) and mass transfer coefficient (k<sub>L</sub>a). The ozone exposure (Ct value) and the log inactivation of E.\u00a0coli in the RPB reached 0.0008-0.0014\u202fmin\u202fmg L<sup>-1</sup> and 6.8-7.3 in phosphate buffered saline buffer, respectively. And the k<sub>L</sub>a in RPB rose from 0.030 to 0.186 s<sup>-1</sup> with the increase of liquid flow rate from 10 to 60\u202fL\u202fh<sup>-1</sup>. The increase of rotation speed of the RPB enhanced the log inactivation and k<sub>L</sub>a simultaneously. It was also noted that a higher gaseous ozone concentration at the identical applied ozone dosage is favorable for the inactivation of E.\u00a0coli. The calculation of Hatta number indicated that the inactivation of E.\u00a0coli in RPB is a diffusion-controlled process for which RPB is well suited. Compared to the conventional bubble reactor, the achievement of high disinfection efficacy at a low Ct value in RPB revealed that RPB is an efficient ozone disinfection contactor for the inactivation of microorganisms in water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
