However, the significance of these compounds in the indoor environment remains to be seen. This work describes an impinger-based sampling and analysis technique for organic nitrate species, focusing on formation via terpene ozonolysis in the presence of nitric oxide (NO). Experiments were conducted in a Teflon film environmental chamber to measure the formation of alkyl nitrates produced from \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis in the presence of NO and alkanes using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. For the different concentrations of NO and O<sub>3</sub> analyzed, the concentration ratio of [O<sub>3</sub>]/[NO] around 1 was found to produce the highest organic nitrate concentration, with [O<sub>3</sub>] = 100 ppb & [NO] = 105 ppb resulting in the most organic nitrate formation, roughly 5 ppb. The experiments on \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis in the presence of NO suggest that organic nitrates have the potential to form in indoor air between infiltrated ozone/NO and terpenes from household and consumer products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States."}], "LastName": "Jackson", "ForeName": "Stephen R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States."}], "LastName": "Harrison", "ForeName": "Joel C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States."}], "LastName": "Ham", "ForeName": "Jason E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States."}], "LastName": "Wells", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CC999999", "Agency": "Intramural CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Atmos Environ (1994)", "NlmUniqueID": "9888534", "ISSNLinking": "1352-2310"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Arey J, Atkinson R, Aschmann SM, 1990.
