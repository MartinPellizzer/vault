This study identifies individual and environmental characteristics of children with asthma from a low-income community with a high number of hospitalizations.<b>Methods</b>: The study population included 902 children admitted at least once to a children's hospital in South Texas because of asthma from 2010 to 2016. The population was divided into three groups by utilization frequency (high: \u22654 times, medium: 2-3 times, or low: 1 time). Individual-level factors at index admission and environmental factors were included for the analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate ordered logistic regression models were applied to identify significant characteristics of high hospital utilizers.<b>Results</b>: The high utilization group comprised 2.4% of total patients and accounted for substantial hospital resource utilization: 10.8% of all admissions and 13.5% of days stayed in the hospital. Patients in the high utilization group showed longer length of stay (LOS) and shorter time between admissions on average than the other two groups. The multivariate ordered logistic regression models revealed that age of 5-11\u2009years (OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.35-0.93), longer LOS (2\u2009days: OR = 1.80, 95%CI = 1.15-2.84; \u22653\u2009days: OR = 3.38, 95%CI = 2.10-5.46), warm season at index admission (OR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.01-2.20), and higher average ozone level in children's residential neighborhoods (OR = 1.78, 95%CI = 1.01-3.14) were significantly associated with a higher number of asthma hospitalizations.<b>Conclusions</b>: The findings suggest the importance of monitoring high hospital utilizers and establishing strategies for such patients based on their characteristics to reduce repeated hospitalizations and to increase optimal use of hospital resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Outcomes Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Juha", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Outcomes Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Health & Nature, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Kash", "ForeName": "Bita A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiaohui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Benden", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Driscoll Children's Hospital, Corpus Christi, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Roberts", "ForeName": "Jon", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Carrillo", "ForeName": "Genny", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals, Pediatric"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Length of Stay"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32962451", "10.1080/02770903.2020.1827424"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
