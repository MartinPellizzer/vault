While early studies have evaluated their impact globally or regionally, the BVOC emissions emitted from urban green spaces (denoted as U-BVOC emissions) have been largely ignored primarily due to the failure of low-resolution land cover in resolving such processes, but also because their important contribution to urban BVOCs was previously unrecognized. In this study, by utilizing a recently released high-resolution land cover dataset, we develop the first set of emission inventories of U-BVOCs in China at spatial resolutions as high as 1 km. This new dataset resolved densely distributed U-BVOCs in urban core areas. The U-BVOC emissions in megacities could account for a large fraction of total BVOC emissions, and the good agreement of the interannual variations between the U-BVOC emissions and ozone concentrations over certain regions stresses their potentially crucial role in influencing ozone variations. The newly constructed U-BVOC emission inventory is expected to provide an improved dataset to enable the research community to re-examine the modulation of BVOCs on the formation of ozone, SOA, and atmospheric chemistry in urban environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Frontiers Science Center for Deep Ocean Multispheres and Earth
