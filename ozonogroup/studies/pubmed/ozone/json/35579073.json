Studies indicate that miRNAs are implicated in ischemic heart disease, and ozone therapy could protect the heart from ischemic heart disease. In this study, we investigated the effect of ozone on miR-200c expression and the potential role of miR-200c in an I/R myocardial injury model.", "A myocardial cellular model of I/R was established to detect the expression of miR-200c. Cardiomyocytes with I/R induction were treated with ozone as a cellular model to detect miR-200 expression and investigate its functional roles. The downstream target of miR-200c was predicted with Starbase online tools and validated by dual luciferase reporter assay. The function of miR-200c/FOXO3 axis in I/R was examined by CCK-8 proliferation and apoptotic assays.", "miR-200c was upregulated in primary cardiomyocytes of the I/R model. In cardiomyocyte cells, cell proliferation in the I/R group was significantly impaired, which could be partially rescued by miR-200c inhibitor or ozone treatment. Cell death detected by LDH release and apoptosis assay in the I/R model could also be inhibited by miR-200c inhibitor or ozone treatment. FOXO3 was identified as a downstream target of miR-200c, which was induced by ozone treatment and suppressed by miR-200c. Silencing FOXO3 abrogated the protective effect of ozone treatment on the I/R cell model.", "Overall, our results suggest that ozone plays a cardio-protective role in I/R through regulating miR-200/FOXO3 axis, and indicate that targeting miR-200/FOXO3 axis could potentially alleviate I/R."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lian", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, China."}], "LastName": "Men", "ForeName": "Xingping", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular, Panyu Central Hospital (Cardiovascular Institute of Panyu District), Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shenglong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Panyu Central Hospital (Medical Imaging Institute of Panyu District), Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Huizhuang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular, Panyu Central Hospital (Cardiovascular Institute of Panyu District), Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Panyu Central Hospital (Medical Imaging Institute of Panyu District), Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hanwei", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, China."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Shaohua", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Recept Signal Transduct Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9509432", "ISSNLinking": "1079-9893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Forkhead Box Protein O3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MicroRNAs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Forkhead Box Protein O3"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "MicroRNAs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35579073", "10.1080/10799893.2022.2060259"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
