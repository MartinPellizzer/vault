However, the precise mechanisms governing these interactions and their resulting environmental implications remain unclear. By theoretical simulations, this work uncovers multi-functional compounds and high oxygen molecules as important products arising from the interaction between DEP/DEHP and O<sub>3</sub>, which are closely linked to SOA formation. Further analysis reveals a strong affinity of DEP/DEHP for mineral dust surfaces, with an adsorption energy of 22.11/30.91\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup>, consistent with a higher concentration of DEHP on the dust surface. Importantly, mineral particles are found to inhibit every step of the reaction process, albeit resulting in lower product toxicity compared to the parent compounds. Thus, timely removal of dust in an indoor environment may reduce the accumulation and residue of PAEs indoors, and further reduce the combined exposure risk produced by PAEs-dust. This study aims to enhance our understanding of the interaction between PAEs and SOA formation, and to develop a fundamental reaction model at the air-solid surface, thereby shedding light on the microscopic behaviors and pollution mechanisms of phthalates on indoor dust surfaces."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
