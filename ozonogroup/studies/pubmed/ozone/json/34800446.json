In 2019, we conducted three cruises to study the spatial and temporal variability of N<sub>2</sub>O distribution and emissions in the Bohai Sea (BS) and North Yellow Sea (NYS), and analyzed the regional sources and sinks. The maximum average N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations were observed in the summer, followed by autumn, while the minimum was observed in the spring. The N<sub>2</sub>O concentration decreased in a gradient from the estuary to the continental shelf, particularly in summer, which indicated that the riverine input from the estuary was a strong source of N<sub>2</sub>O in the Bohai Sea. Due to the vertical mixing of the water column, the vertical distribution of N<sub>2</sub>O was moderate in autumn, while the bottom remained a hotspot for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in spring and summer. The generalized additive model (GAM) showed that the temperature, salinity, DO and pH were strong predictors of N<sub>2</sub>O in the BS and NYS. Excess N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations were positively linearly correlated with the apparent oxygen utilization and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations, which suggested that nitrification was the dominant process of in situ N<sub>2</sub>O production in the BS and NYS. The mixing of water masses, especially DW (diluted water) and BCW (Bohai Sea coastal water), provided a significant amount of N<sub>2</sub>O to the entire shelf area of the BS. In addition, the coastal input was a dominate pusher of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the estuarine region. Overall, the annual N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from BS and NYS were approximately 1.72\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0Tg\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, which accounted for 0.51% of the annual global marine N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, but only 0.04% of the total area of the world's oceans. Hence, both the BS and NYS acted as N<sub>2</sub>O sources to the atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
