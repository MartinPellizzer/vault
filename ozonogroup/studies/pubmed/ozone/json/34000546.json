Understanding their emission mechanisms and the current progress in emission measurements and estimations are essential for the accurate determination of emission characteristics, as well as for evaluating their roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate change. This review summarizes the mechanisms of terpenoid synthesis and release, biotic and abiotic factors affecting their emissions, development of emission observation techniques, and emission estimations from hundreds of published papers. We provide a review of the main observations and estimations in China, which contributes a significant proportion to the total global BVOC emissions. The review suggests the need for further research on the comprehensive effects of environmental factors on terpenoid emissions, especially soil moisture and nitrogen content, which should be quantified in emission models to improve the accuracy of estimation. In China, it is necessary to conduct more accurate measurements for local plants in different regions using the dynamic enclosure technique to establish an accurate local emission rate database for dominant tree species. This will help improve the accuracy of both national and global emission inventories. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of terpenoid emissions as well as prospects for detailed research to accurately describe terpenoid emission characteristics worldwide and in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
