Previous studies have assessed relative crop yield losses by using exposure-response equations with observed or simulated O<sub>3</sub>, however, the contribution of enhanced O<sub>3</sub> due to potential HONO sources to the crop yield losses has never been quantified. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated the crop yield losses caused by potential HONO sources in the North China Plain (NCP), which is one of the major grain-producing areas in China suffering from heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution, by using the Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model during the wheat and maize growing seasons of 2016. HONO simulations were significantly improved after including six potential HONO sources in the WRF-Chem model. The potential HONO sources produced a daily maximum 8-h O<sub>3</sub> enhancement of 8.1/8.2\u00a0ppb during the wheat/maize growing seasons, respectively, and led to ~11.4%/3.3% relative yield losses for wheat/maize, respectively, corresponding to approximately US$3.78/0.66 billion losses, respectively, in NCP in 2016. The above results suggest that potential HONO sources play a significant role in O<sub>3</sub> formation and could induce high crop yield losses globally."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
