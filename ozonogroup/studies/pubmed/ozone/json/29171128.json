The use of nitrogen fertilizers is known as the major reason for atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> O increase. Empirical bottom-up models therefore estimate agricultural N<sub>2</sub> O inventories using N loading as the sole predictor, disregarding the regional heterogeneities in soil inherent response to external N loading. Several environmental factors have been found to influence the response in soil N<sub>2</sub> O emission to N fertilization, but their interdependence and relative importance have not been addressed properly. Here, we show that soil pH is the chief factor explaining regional disparities in N<sub>2</sub> O emission, using a global meta-analysis of 1,104 field measurements. The emission factor (EF) of N<sub>2</sub> O increases significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) with soil pH decrease. The default EF value of 1.0%, according to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel\u00a0on Climate Change) for agricultural soils, occurs at soil pH 6.76. Moreover, changes in EF with N fertilization (i.e. \u0394EF) is also negatively correlated (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) with soil pH. This indicates that N<sub>2</sub> O emission in acidic soils is more sensitive to changing N fertilization than that in alkaline soils. Incorporating our findings into bottom-up models has significant consequences for regional and global N<sub>2</sub> O emission inventories and reconciling them with those from top-down models. Moreover, our results allow region-specific development of tailor-made N<sub>2</sub> O mitigation measures in agriculture."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yajing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5286-958X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jingheng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Vogt", "ForeName": "Rolf David", "Initials": "RD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, \u00c5s, Norway."}], "LastName": "Mulder", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jingguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoshan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Glob Chang Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9888746", "ISSNLinking": "1354-1013"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29171128", "10.1111/gcb.13966"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
