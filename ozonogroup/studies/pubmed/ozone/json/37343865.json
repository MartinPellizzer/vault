In this study, we investigated the emission factors (EFs) of 120 individual VOC species for 40 machines via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection and high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that the diesel-based VOC EF for the tested machines was 4.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.55 (average\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) g/kg fuel, dominated by alkanes (38.20\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.08\u00a0%) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs; 30.94\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.71\u00a0%). The machine type, rated power, emission standards, and operating conditions affected the emissions of VOCs and their components, and this effect maybe mostly depends on the fuel combustion efficiency. The VOC species were primarily distributed in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> (based on the carbon number) and B<sub>4</sub>-B<sub>6</sub> (based on the saturated vapor concentration) intervals. Furthermore, the estimated formation potential (FP) values of SOAs and O<sub>3</sub> from VOCs were 21.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.57\u00a0mg/kg fuel and 15.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.87\u00a0g/kg fuel, respectively. VOC control based on the SOA formation potential (SOAFP) and ozone formation potential (OFP) could be more effective in the mitigation of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub> pollution because the top 5 species ranked by percentage contribution accounted for 83.09\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.59\u00a0% and 51.78\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.38\u00a0% of the estimated SOAFP and OFP, respectively. Finally, the emission estimates showed that the VOC emissions originating from construction and agricultural machinery in China (2020) reached 64.05 and 95.24 Gg, respectively. We provide species-specific VOC EFs and detailed emission characteristics to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of gas emissions originating from nonroad mobile sources and an update of emission inventories and atmospheric chemistry models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
