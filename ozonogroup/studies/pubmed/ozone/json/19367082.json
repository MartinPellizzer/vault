Both ozone and activated carbon treatments for 20 min were effective in removing E2 (initial concentration, 100 mg/L). However, both treatments have been used for two processes, and the disposal time with these treatments is more than that of another treatment. In this study, ozone treatment with activated carbon was investigated with regard to the percentage of E2 removal, pH, and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The physical and chemical characteristics of the activated carbon surface were modified due to the ozone treatment: the surface was oxidized by ozone. The surface of activated carbon exhibited polarity groups and became porous after ozone treatment. The amount of E2 adsorbed onto the ozone-treated activated carbon surface was similar to that adsorbed onto the untreated activated carbon surface. The percentage of E2 removal by ozone treatment with activated carbon was greater than that by ozone treatment alone. Moreover, the rate of E2 removal by ozone treatment with activated carbon was higher than that by ozone or activated carbon treatments alone. Ozone with activated carbon treatment may be used for the removal of E2. However, this ozone treatment for the degradation of E2 may have a greater COD than that in the case of activated carbon treatment alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Kinki University, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan. kawasaki@phar.kindai.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawasaki", "ForeName": "Naohito", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogata", "ForeName": "Fumihiko", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "Isao", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tominaga", "ForeName": "Hisato", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Porosity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19367082", "10.5650/jos.58.261", "JST.JSTAGE/jos/58.261"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
