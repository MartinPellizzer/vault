In order to control the heavy haze pollution, it is essential to find out the contributions of main SOA precursors. Nowadays, the tracer-based method has been widely used in analyzing the contributions of the precursors to SOA. However, it is not well known that whether the SOA tracers can be oxidized or how the instability of the SOA tracers would influence the accuracy of the tracer-based method for source apportionment. In this paper, the heterogeneous oxidation experiments of SOA tracers produced from isoprene and toluene as well as their mixtures under different conditions were conducted in a 2\u00a0m<sup>3</sup> indoor chamber. The relative rate constants approach was used to determine the effective rate constants of the ozone reactions of the tracers. Concentrations of 2-Methyl Erythritol, a tracer of isoprene SOA, and 2, 3-Dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic Acid, a tracer of toluene SOA, were analyzed using GC-MS. The effects of different seed aerosols and initial VOC<sub>0</sub>/NO on the heterogeneous oxidation of the tracers were investigated. The effects of co-existing components in the SOA produced from the mixture of isoprene and toluene on the heterogeneous oxidation of the tracers by ozone were also studied."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
