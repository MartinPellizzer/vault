Experimental results indicate that the phenol under alkaline condition and aniline in all pH conditions cause a serious color problem during the period of early initial ozonation. In addition, the ozonated aniline exhibited more severe color formation than the ozonated phenol did. Both of these compounds revealed that either a high compound concentration or low ozone dosage applied incurred a strong color forming phenomena. Moreover, according to the Microtox test, both ozonated byproducts increased the toxicity during early ozonation when the color formation occurred. The EC50-value as COD decreased from 0.72 (for phenol, pH = 7) to 1.38 (for aniline, pH = 4) orders-of-magnitude. This observation implies that the ozonated color formation would generate new toxicity problems if these colored matters were not further oxidized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Taiwan University, 71 Chou-Shan Rd., Taipei, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "N C", "Initials": "NC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SIR7XX2F1K", "NameOfSubstance": "aniline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11360447", "10.1081/ese-100102929"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
