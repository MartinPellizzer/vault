Batch experiments were conducted using two water samples from the same plant: post precipitation plant effluent and the same effluent after a polishing treatment in a wetland. The effects of ozonation on chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD(7)), colour and turbidity were investigated. Ozonation with dosages up to 2.7 mg/L substantially decreased the COD of biochemically treated municipal wastewater. One gram of ozone decreased the amount of COD by 1.5 g. With higher dosages, the effectiveness of ozone on COD decreased rapidly. Ozone was a very effective colour and turbidity reducer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process and Environmental Engineering, University of Oulu, Linnanmaa, Finland. jarmo.sallanko@oulu.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sallanko", "ForeName": "Jarmo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okkonen", "ForeName": "Jarkko", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19085595", "10.1080/10934520802515350", "906808038"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
