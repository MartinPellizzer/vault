A new type of high-voltage pulse generator with a thyratron switch and a Blumlein pulse-forming network (BPFN) was used in our experiments. The experiments were conducted at a gas-flow rate of 13 m3/h. Important parameters, including peak voltage, chemical structures of malodorants, pulse frequency, and initial concentration, which influenced the removal efficiency, were investigated. The results showed that the mixed malodorants could be treated effectively by pulse corona. The removal efficiencies of 200 mg/m3 C2H5SH and 200 mg/m3 H2S for group 1 were 95.6% and 100%, respectively, which were almost equal to those of the two pollutants separately. The energy cost was about 65.1-81.4 J/L, which was 31.5-45.2% lower than for treating pollutants alone. The removal efficiencies of 105 mg/m3 C2HsSH and 40 mg/m3 NH3 for group 2 were 93.1% and almost 100%, and the energy cost was 65.1 J/L, 55.6% lower than that which was treated separately. In the case of two groups of mixed malodorants removal, NOx, 03, SO2, CO2, and CO were all observed. Moreover, some sulfur and white crystal ammonium nitrates were discovered adhering to the corona wires in the removal of groups 1 and 2, respectively. A dynamics model was developed to describe the relation of the removal efficiency with specific energy density and initial concentration. In the case of group 1 removal,the decomposition rate constants decreased as compared to the single treating. As for group 2 removal, the decomposition rate constants increased, especially for NH3. According to the results, the optimization design for the reactor and the matching of high pulse voltage source can be reckoned."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China. shiyao@zju.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M439R54A1D", "NameOfSubstance": "ethanethiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T8YA51M7Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "ammonium nitrate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YY9FVM7NSN", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16190240", "10.1021/es048583q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
