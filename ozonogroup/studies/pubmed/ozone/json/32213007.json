For the investigation of degradation mechanism of NNDEA, the aqueous solutions of NNDEA were exposed to Advanced Oxidation processes (AOP's) such as gamma-irradiation, ozonation, UV irradiation and UV/Ozone (ozone effect) and UV/H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide effect). Since the structure of NNDEA is small, it is rapidly degraded in all processes except UV-irradiation process but forming acetic acid and formic acid just was seen in gamma and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>processes. In the other processes, NNDEA is transformed directly to nitrite and nitrate which they can form NNDEA again in the medium. The concentration of NNDEA was decreased from 50 to 21\u2005mg L<sup>-1</sup> after 2.20\u2005kGy gamma-irradiation. After 2.85\u2005kGy gamma irradiation, NNDEA was completely removed from the medium. The results showed that the concentration of NNDEA decreased with UV-irradiation time, the concentration of 50\u2005mg L<sup>-1</sup> NNDEA was 42, 30, 24 and 19\u2005mg L<sup>-1</sup> after 10, 20, 40 and 60 min UV-irradiation, respectively. It has been investigated that the UV-irradiation does not have much effect on the degradation of 50\u2005mg L<sup>-1</sup> NNDEA solution and requires long-term irradiation. In this study, gamma-irradiation was chosen as the best method because of the complete degradation effect and the prevention of the reformation of the NNDEA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2168-6035"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Mehrnia", "ForeName": "Masoomeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Torun", "ForeName": "Murat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u015eolpan", "ForeName": "Dilek", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3IQ78TTX1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Diethylnitrosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32213007", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1748118"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
