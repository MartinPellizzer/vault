The interactions of four typical cell types (e.g., bacterial, fungal, plant, and mammalian cells) with UBs have been studied over recent years. For bacterial cells, UBs have been utilized in creating the capillary force to tear down biofilms. The release of high amounts of heat, pressure, and free radicals during bubble rupture is also found to affect bacterial cell growth. Similarly, the bubble gas core identity plays an important role in the development of fungal cells. By the proposed mechanism of attachment of UBs on hydrophobin proteins in the fungal cell wall, oxygen and ozone gas-filled ultrafine bubbles can either promote or hinder the cell growth rate. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and mass transfer facilitation are two means of indirect interactions between UBs and plant cells. Likewise, the use of different gas cores in generating bubbles can produce different physical effects on these cells, for example, hydrogen gas for antioxidation against infections and oxygen for oxidation of toxic metal ions. For mammalian cells, the importance of investigating their interactions with UBs lies in the bubbles' action on cell viability as membrane poration for drug delivery can greatly affect cells' survival. UBs have been utilized and tested in forming the pores by different methods, ranging from bubble oscillation and microstream generation through acoustic cavitation to bubble implosion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Tran", "ForeName": "Nguyen Le Hanh", "Initials": "NLH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "Thien Quang", "Initials": "TQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Duong", "ForeName": "Phuong Vu Quynh", "Initials": "PVQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Doan", "ForeName": "Linh Hai", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Vu", "ForeName": "Mai Phuong", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Khang Huy Phuc", "Initials": "KHP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3934-0371"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Khoi Tan", "Initials": "KT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7YNJ3PO35Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acoustics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38153335", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c03223"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
