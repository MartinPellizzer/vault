We fit Cox models to assess 30-day readmissions as a function of these pollutants, adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics and ambient temperature. Analyses were then stratified by treating hospital performance on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services risk-standardized 30-day poststroke all-cause readmission measure to determine if the results were independent of performance: low (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rate for hospital <25th percentile of national rate), high (>75th percentile), and intermediate (all others).", "Of 448 148 patients with stroke, 12.5% were readmitted within 30 days. Except for tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> (no national standard), average 2-year CO, O<sub>3</sub>, particulate matter 2.5, and SO<sub>2</sub> values were below national limits. Each one SD increase in average annual CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, particulate matter 2.5, and SO<sub>2</sub> exposure was associated with an adjusted 1.1% (95% CI, 0.4-1.9%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.9%-4.4%), 1.2% (95% CI, 0.2%-2.3%), and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%) increased risk of 30-day readmission, respectively, and O<sub>3</sub> with a 0.7% (95% CI, 0.0%-1.5%) decrease.
