It is, however, questionable whether this condition affects working performance in occupational settings. The aim of this study is to determine the predictive value of age as well as traffic related air and noise pollutions for fatigue. 246 traffic officers participated in this study. Air pollution data were obtained from the local Air Quality Control Company. A sound level meter was used for measuring ambient noise. Fatigue was evaluated by the MFI-20 questionnaire. The general and physical scales showed the highest, while the reduced activity scale showed the lowest level of fatigue. Age had an independent direct effect on reduced activity and physical fatigue. The average of daytime equivalent noise level was between 71.63 and 88.51\u2005dB(A). In the case of high noise exposure, older officers feel more fatigue than younger ones. Exposure to PM10 and O3 resulted in general and physical fatigue. Complex Interactions between SO2, CO and NO2 were found. Exposure to noise and some components of air pollution, especially O3 and PM10, increases fatigue. The authorities should adopt and rigorously implement environmental protection policies in order to protect people."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Iran."}], "LastName": "Jazani", "ForeName": "Reza Khani", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saremi", "ForeName": "Mahnaz", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rezapour", "ForeName": "Tara", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kavousi", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shirzad", "ForeName": "Hadi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Occup Saf Ergon", "NlmUniqueID": "9507598", "ISSNLinking": "1080-3548"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fatigue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Noise, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Police"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Report"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26323778", "10.1080/10803548.2015.1029288"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
