An integrated MBR-ozonation system was set-up by placing the ozonation reactor in the recirculation stream of the MBR effluent. A conventional treatment set-up (ozonation as polishing step after MBR) was also used as a reference. The biological treatment alone reached an average COD removal of 99%, which remained unvaried when the ozonation step was introduced. An acyclovir removal of 99% was also obtained with the MBR step and the ozonation allowed to further remove 99% of the residual concentration in the MBR effluent. For several of the 28 organics identified in the wastewater the efficiency of the MBR treatment improved from 20% to 60% as soon as the ozonation was placed in the recirculation stream. The benefit of the integrated system, with respect to the conventional treatment set-up was evident for the removal of a specific ozonation by-product. The latter was efficiently removed in the integrated system, being its abundance in the final effluent 20-fold lower than what obtained when ozonation was used as a polishing step. In addition, if the conventional treatment configuration is employed, the same performance of the integrated system in terms of by-product removal can only be obtained when the ozonation is operated for longer than 60 min. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the integrated system compared to the conventional polishing configuration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
