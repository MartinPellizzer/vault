The presence of spin adducts was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of chloroform extracts of lung and liver homogenates. No significant levels of adducts were detected in the lungs of air control animals. Benzoyl N-tert-butyl aminoxyl, attributed to direct reaction of ozone with PBN, and tert-butyl hydroaminoxyl, the scission product of the hydroxyl adduct of PBN, were detected in the lungs of ozone exposed rats. EPR signals for carbon-centred alkoxyl and alkyl adducts were also detected with PBN in the lungs and liver of animals exposed to ozone. With POBN, only carbon-centred alkyl radicals were detected. Senescent, 24 months old rats were found to retain about twice more 14C-PBN in blood, heart and lungs by comparison to juvenile, 2 months old animals. Accordingly, the EPR signals were generally stronger in the lungs of the senescent rats by comparison to juvenile rats. Together, the observations were consistent with the previously proposed notion that a significant flux of hydrogen peroxide produced from the reaction of ozone with lipids of the extracellular lining, or from activated macrophages in the lungs could be a source of biologically relevant amounts of hydroxyl radical."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Directorate, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
