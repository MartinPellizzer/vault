Each of the 35 wounded persons hat at least two similar gunshot wounds, one on the lower leg or forearm and the other on the upper leg or upper arm. During the first 10 days all wounds were treated with 10% NaCl water solution dressings until the moment when healthy granulations were observed. Thereafter, the defects were covered with split-thickness skin grafts according to Thiersch. For technical reasons we treated grafts on the lower leg and forearm with ozone following the usual scheme. Grafts on the upper leg or upper arm were treated in the conventional way and they served as a control group. The results obtained in the group followed up are presented by percentage of graft takes after 10 days and accordingly compared with the results obtained in the control group. There was a higher percentage of takes in ozone-treated split-thickness skin grafts. More than 74.3% of the split-thickness skin grafts treated with ozone had a take of more than 75% of the covered surface as apposed to only 40% of the grafts treated with the conventional method. The results in these two groups were compared with a chi square matched pair test. Difference in take of the skin grafts in these two groups was statistically significant at P < 0.01."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zagreb University School of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Clinical Hospital Center Rebro, Croatia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turci\u0107", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hancevi\u0107", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Antoljak", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zic", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alfirevi\u0107", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Langenbecks Arch Chir", "NlmUniqueID": "0204167", "ISSNLinking": "0023-8236"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Arm Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Croatia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "External Fixators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Graft Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Leg Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Warfare"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Infection"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds, Gunshot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Drugs Exp Clin Res. 1993;19(2):59-64", "ArticleIdList": ["8223143"]}, {"Citation": "Zentralbl Hyg Umweltmed. 1993 Sep;194(5-6):464-80", "ArticleIdList": ["8267833"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7791484", "10.1007/BF00207719"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
