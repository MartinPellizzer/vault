Ozone is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents and is applied in gaseous or aqueous form for sanitation purposes. However, the strong oxidative effect could affect the nutritional and sensorial quality, in particular, when time of washing is extended. For that reason, the overall impact of ozonated water (0.4\u2009mg/L) dipping applied during 1, 3 and 5\u2009min compared to control washed in water during 5\u2009min was studied in tomato slices stored during 14 days at 5\u2009. According to the results, ozonated water treatment of 3\u2009min achieved the best firmness retention, microbial quality (mesophilic, psychrotrophic and yeas load) and reduced the consumption of fructose and glucose. The use of ozonated water did not affect the total acidity, pH, total solid soluble, organic acid as ascorbic, fumaric or succinic acid and the sensorial parameters, which were only affected by storage time. However, the poor appearance, aroma and overall quality obtained in all treatments prevented shelf life of 14 days and the quality at acceptable levels was established in 10 days at 5\u2009. It is recommended to wash tomato slices with 0.4\u2009mg/L ozonated water for 3\u2009min only. Extending treatment duration did not improve the microbiological quality, possibly due to the extra time permitting the ozone to react with other components of the fruit tissue, undermining the antimicrobial benefits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1Postharvest and Refrigeration Group, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Spain."}], "LastName": "Aguayo", "ForeName": "Encarna", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Escalona", "ForeName": "V\u00edctor", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Silveira", "ForeName": "Ana Cecilia", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Art\u00e9s", "ForeName": "Francisco", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Food Sci Technol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9889534", "ISSNLinking": "1082-0132"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Quality"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23774605", "10.1177/1082013213482846", "1082013213482846"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
