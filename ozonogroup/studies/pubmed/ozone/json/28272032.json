During the process, the as-prepared catalyst was endowed with higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area of 412.3 m<sup>2</sup>/g compared to 124.6 m<sup>2</sup>/g of the natural sepiolite. Hence, in the adsorption of methylene blue, the as-prepared catalyst was observed with a very high removal rate of 96.2% although a little lower than the modified sepiolite of 97.5% in 100 min. And for practical application, the catalyst was used for treating the effluent from regenerated-papermaking industry, via a heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process. Consequently, the highest color removal rate of 99.5%, and the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 73.4% were achieved in 20 and 30 min, respectively. As a result, the treated wastewater was more biodegradable and less toxic; the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>)/COD value could reach 0.41. Moreover, the catalyst showed superior stability at successive ozonation runs. The main possible reaction pathway is also presented. The results indicate that catalytic ozonation was proved to be effective when Mn/sepiolite was used as catalysts applied to the advanced treatment of regenerated-papermaking wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper Engineering, South China University of Technology, No. 381, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, CN 510641, China E-mail: 954867716@qq.com; State Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper Engineering, Plant Micro/nano Fiber Research Center, School of Light Industry and Engineering, South China University of Technology, No. 381, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, CN 510641, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper Engineering, South China University of Technology, No. 381, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, CN 510641, China E-mail: 954867716@qq.com; State Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper Engineering, Plant Micro/nano Fiber Research Center, School of Light Industry and Engineering, South China University of Technology, No. 381, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, CN 510641, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rendang", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper Engineering, South China University of Technology, No. 381, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, CN 510641, China E-mail: 954867716@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium Silicates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C2E1CI501T", "NameOfSubstance": "magnesium trisilicate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium Silicates"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recycling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28272032", "10.2166/wst.2016.583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
