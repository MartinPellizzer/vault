It is necessary to understand the mechanism of action of ARB and ARGs to formulate measures to solve this problem. This study aimed to determine the mechanism of antibiotic resistance spread during sub-lethal ozonation of ARB with different antibiotic resistance targets, including proteins, cell walls, and cell membranes. ARB conjugation and transformation frequencies increased after exposure to 0-1.0 mg/L ozone for 10 min. During sub-lethal ozonation, compared with control groups not stimulated by ozone, the conjugative transfer frequencies of E. coli DH5\u03b1 (CTX), E. coli DH5\u03b1 (MCR), and E. coli DH5\u03b1 (GEN) increased by 1.35-2.02, 1.13-1.58, and 1.32-2.12 times, respectively; the transformation frequencies of E. coli DH5\u03b1 (MCR) and E. coli DH5\u03b1 (GEN) increased by 1.49-3.02 and 1.45-1.92 times, respectively. When target inhibitors were added, the conjugative transfer frequencies of antibiotics targeting cell wall and membrane synthesis decreased 0.59-0.75 and 0.43-0.76 times, respectively, while that for those targeting protein synthesis increased by 1-1.38 times. After inhibitor addition, the transformation frequencies of bacteria resistant to antibiotics targeting the cell membrane and proteins decreased by 0.76-0.89 and 0.69-0.78 times, respectively. Cell morphology, cell membrane permeability, reactive oxygen species, and antioxidant enzymes changed with different ozone concentrations. Expression of most genes related to regulating different antibiotic resistance targets was up-regulated when bacteria were exposed to sub-lethal ozonation, further confirming the target genes playing a crucial role in the inactivation of different target bacteria. These results will help guide the careful utilization of ozonation for bacterial inactivation, providing more detailed reference information for ozonation oxidation treatment of ARB and ARGs in aquatic environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
