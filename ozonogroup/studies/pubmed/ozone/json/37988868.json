Synergistic disinfection using UV light emitted by MDEL (MWUV) coupled with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at an ultra-low dose was investigated. Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis were deactivated more effectively by MWUV/O<sub>3</sub> than by either MWUV or O<sub>3</sub> alone. MWUV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment using an O<sub>3</sub> concentration of 0.4\u00a0mg/L gave an E. coli inactivation rate of 5.52\u00a0log. The photoreactivation degree and rate of E. coli were lower after inactivation by MWUV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment than after MWUV treatment alone. The maximum photoreactivation rates after the MWUV/O<sub>3</sub> and MWUV treatments were 2.90% and 16.08%, respectively. MWUV/O<sub>3</sub> disinfection also inhibited dark resurrection of E. coli and gave a maximum dark resurrection rate of 0.0036%. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that more hydroxyl radicals were generated during MWUV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment. Scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal scanning microscopy observations indicated that O<sub>3</sub> played a key role in breaking down the cell structure. MWUV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment gave a good disinfection effect on fecal coliform bacteria in actual domestic wastewater. The results indicated that inactivation of bacteria can be more effectively achieved by MWUV treatment with O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
