A three-week, 3 hr/day study was conducted. The subjects received filtered air on Week 1 and 0.4 ppm O3 on Week 2. During Week 3, 13 subjects were re-exposed to O3 on Friday and 11 were re-exposed to O3 on Tuesday. Spirometric measurements (FVC and FEV1) and bronchial reactivity to methacholine showed adaptation within 2-3 days of the repeated daily exposures (Week 2). Although the duration of adaptation seen with bronchial reactivity appears longer than 7-days, the FVC and FEV1 clearly demonstrated complete loss of adaptation by 7 days, with a trend toward significance by 4 days. We conclude, therefore, the loss of ozone adaptation in pulmonary function is a gradual phenomenon lasting less than 7 days following cessation of repeated daily exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kulle", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sauder", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kerr", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farrell", "ForeName": "B P", "Initials": "BP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bermel", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Ind Hyg Assoc J", "NlmUniqueID": "0371160", "ISSNLinking": "0002-8894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7168440", "10.1080/15298668291410657"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
