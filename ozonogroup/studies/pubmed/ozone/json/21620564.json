Reaction mechanism and products during the absorption process were discussed in the followings. Effects of concentrations of injected ozone, inlet NO, pyrolusite and reaction temperature on NO(x)/SO(2) removal efficiency and Mn extraction rate were also investigated. The results showed that ozone could oxidize NO to NO(2) with selectivity and high efficiency, furthermore, MnO(2) in pyrolusite slurry could oxidize SO(2) and NO(2) into MnSO(4) and Mn(NO(3))(2) in liquid phase, respectively. Temperature and concentrations of injected ozone and inlet NO had little impact on both SO(2) removal efficiency and Mn extraction rate. Specifically, Mn extraction rate remained steady at around 85% when SO(2) removal efficiency dropped to 90%. NO(x) removal efficiency increased with the increasing of ozone concentration, inlet NO concentration and pyrolusite concentration, however, it remained stable when reaction temperature increased from 20\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C and decreased when the flue gas temperature exceeded 40\u00b0C. NO(x) removal efficiency reached 82% when inlet NO at 750 ppm, injected ozone at 900 ppm, concentration of pyrolusite at 500 g/L and temperature at 25\u00b0C."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
