ClO<sub>2</sub> decomposes to form chlorite (ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), which influences the following advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for micropollutant abatement in drinking water. This study aims at investigating the effects of ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> on the concentrations of reactive species (e.g., radicals and ozone) and on the formation of chlorate in the UV/chlorine AOP. Results showed that the concentration of ClO<sup><sup>\u00b7</sup></sup> in the UV/chlorine process remarkably decreased by 98.20-100.00% in the presence of ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> at concentration of 0.1-1.0\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> as NaClO<sub>2</sub>. The concentrations of HO<sup><sup>\u00b7</sup></sup> and ozone decreased by 42.71-65.42% and by 22.02-64.31%, respectively, while the concentration of Cl<sup><sup>\u00b7</sup></sup> was less affected (i.e., 31.00-36.21% reduction). The overall concentrations of the reactive species were differentially impacted by ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>'s multiple roles in the process. UV photolysis of ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generated HO<sup><sup>\u00b7</sup></sup> but not Cl<sup><sup>\u00b7</sup></sup>, ClO<sup><sup>\u00b7</sup></sup> or ozone under the drinking water relevant conditions. ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> also competed with chlorine for UV photons but this effect was minor (< 1.0%). The radicals/ozone scavenging by ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> outcompeted the above two to lead to the overall decreasing concentrations of the reactive species, in consistency with the kinetic model predicted trends. ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> reacted with radicals and ozone to form chlorate (ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) but not perchlorate (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>). HO<sup><sup>\u00b7</sup></sup> played a dominant role in ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation. The findings improved the fundamental understanding on micropollutant abatement and inorganic byproduct formation by the UV/chlorine process and other AOPs in ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-containing water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
