Male Wistar rats were fed with 7% and 23% protein diets. Two groups were formed for each nutritional condition: one group was exposed for 15 successive days to 0.75 ppm of ozone and the other to air. Subsequently, the brain was dissected in cortex, hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem to measure the activity of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), ATPase, and levels of GSH. The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase increased in cerebellum of well-nourished rats exposed to ozone, while total ATPase and TBARS decreased in all studied areas in the malnourished groups. The levels of GSH decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the brain of rats fed with 7% of protein diet and exposed to ozone but increased in rats fed with normal diet and exposed to ozone. These results suggest that malnutrition causes alterations in the values of Na+/K+ ATPase, total ATPase, GSH, and lipid peroxidation, while ozone contributes to these modifications. As a consequence, both variables are involved in oxidative stress in the rat brain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Neuroqu\u00edmica, Instituto Nacional de Pediatr\u00eda, Mexico Ciy, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calder\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barrag\u00e1n Mej\u00eda", "ForeName": "Gerardo", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Ernestina", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju\u00e1rez Olgu\u00edn", "ForeName": "Hugo", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Status"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17044775", "10.1207/s15327914nc5502_11"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
