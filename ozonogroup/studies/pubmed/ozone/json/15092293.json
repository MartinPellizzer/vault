The plants did not exhibit any visible injury, but levels of several amino acids and polyamines were altered in comparison with control plants (50 microg m(-3) ozone, mist of pH 5.6), the changes being pronounced in clone 14. Total free amino acids as well as methionine titers were increased in clone 14. Asparagine was significantly increased in clone 11 and less so in clone 14. Arginine, which comprised more than 50% of the free amino acids in spruce needles, was not changed by the exposure regime applied. Reduced glutathione was significantly increased in all clones/soil/needle age combinations (average increase 50%). Free soluble putrescine was enhanced by 50-200% in clone 14, but remained unchanged in clone 11. Conjugated putrescine was significantly, and conjugated spermidime was slightly, increased in both clones, whereas other polyamines did not responde to the treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Toxikologie GSF Munich, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstr. 1, D-8042 Neuherberg, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dohmen", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koppers", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Langebartels", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092293", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90059-l", "0269-7491(90)90059-L"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
