Fluorescence spectra show that both 1-octanol and octanoic acid coatings give rise to similar decreased polarity at the interface relative to the uncoated surface and show a similar propensity of pyrene to partition to the interface. Ozonation kinetics follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, indicating a surface reaction. At high ozone concentrations, a monolayer coating of 1-octanol enhances the rate relative to the uncoated surface and a coating of octanoic acid decreases the rate. Pyrene fluorescence is most efficiently quenched by ozone in the presence of a 1-octanol coating, followed by the uncoated surface, and least efficiently quenched by ozone in the presence of octanoic acid. In agreement with earlier work, a significant photoenhancement of the ozonation is observed at the uncoated surface; however, no enhancement is observed with monolayer coatings of either organic. Quantum chemical calculations indicate a reasonable binding of ozone by the carboxylic acid group (in both its dissociated and undissociated forms). We suggest that the inhibition of the water surface reaction by a monolayer of octanoic acid is due to the sequestration of ozone by the carboxylic acid group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3H6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "Elyse A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donaldson", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22107352", "10.1021/jp2094627"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
