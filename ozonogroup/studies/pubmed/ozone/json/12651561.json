After 100 days of treatment, leaf drop and development of necrotic spots were observed in O(3)-fumigated plants of Moraiolo but not of Frantoio. Significant reductions in photosynthetic activity (57%) and stomatal conductance (69%) were detected in O(3)-fumigated plants of Frantoio compared with control plants. In O(3)-fumigated plants of Moraiolo, the decrease in photosynthetic activity (17%) was not statistically significant, but a significant reduction in stomatal conductance (40%) was observed. In both cultivars, leaves that developed after exposure to O(3) showed decreased stomatal aperture (63.6 and 54.8% with respect to the Frantoio and Moraiolo controls, respectively) and one-sided leaf area, and increased stomatal density compared with control leaves. Actual transpiring stomatal surface decreased substantially in both Frantoio (59.8%) and Moraiolo (56.3%) in response to O(3) treatment. Relative transpiring stomatal surface (RTSS) in Frantoio decreased from 0.54 (control) to 0.27% (O(3) treated) of total leaf surface. The corresponding values for Moraiolo were 0.79 and 0.42%. However, because the RTSS of Moraiolo leaves in the O(3) treatment was 0.42 versus 0.27% in Frantoio, the potential uptake of O(3) was higher for Moraiolo plants than for Frantoio plants. The large O(3)-induced reduction in transpiring stomatal surface in both cultivars could have significant effects on olive productivity in the Mediterranean area, where high O(3) concentrations persist for long periods during the year."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scuola Superiore di Studi Universitari e de Perfezionamento S.
