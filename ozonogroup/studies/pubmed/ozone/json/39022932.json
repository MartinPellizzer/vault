Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of O<sub>3</sub> pollution utilizing the OFP-PMF-EKMA method combined with online hourly resolution monitoring data of conventional pollutants and volatile organic compounds \uff08VOCs\uff09 in the summer of 2022 \uff08June-September\uff09. Ozone formation potential \uff08OFP\uff09 was used to identify the key VOCs species, and the PMF model was used to identify the VOCs emission sources, whereas EKMA curves and scenario analysis were used to identify the main ozone control area in Hebi and to determine the reduction ratio of VOCs and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> in a scientifically refined way. In 2022, Hebi had persistent O<sub>3</sub> pollution, with the highest concentration in June. Conditions of high temperature, low humidity, and low atmospheric pressure contributed to the O<sub>3</sub> accumulation. Aromatic and oxygenated volatile organic compounds \uff08OVOCs\uff09 contributed significantly to the OFP and VOCs fraction, which were the dominant active substance and concentration dominant species. The results of the VOCs source analysis indicated that vehicle exhaust sources \uff0825.3%\uff09 were the main source of atmospheric VOCs, followed by process sources \uff0817.7%\uff09 and biomass combustion sources \uff0817.6%\uff09. Thus, emission sources associated with the combustion of fossil fuels and industrial production emissions were the most urgent sources of atmospheric VOCs to be controlled in Hebi. The O<sub>3</sub> generation in Hebi occurred in the VOCs-sensitive zones, and the emission reduction results showed that a synergistic emission reduction of VOCs and nitrogen oxide \uff08NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>\uff09 could effectively control O<sub>3</sub> pollution with a 75% reduction in VOCs and a 10% reduction in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Department of Environmental Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Department of Environmental Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Zhan-Xia", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin-Min", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Department of Environmental Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Sha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Department of Environmental Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Department of Environmental Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lan-Tian", "Initials": "LT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39022932", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202307102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
