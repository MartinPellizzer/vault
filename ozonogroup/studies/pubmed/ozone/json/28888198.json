We evaluate the association between NO<sub>2</sub> and daily mortality among elderly using one- and multipollutant models.", "This study was a daily time series of non-accidental and cause-specific mortality among the elderly living in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, between 2000 and 2011. Effects of NO<sub>2</sub>, particulate matter smaller than 10\u00b5m (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were estimated in Poisson generalized additive models. The single lag effect at lags 0 and 1 days and the cumulative effect from 0 to lag 10 days were evaluated in one-, two-, three- and four-pollutant models. The cumulative risk index (CRI) recently proposed to analyze associations with health of multiple correlated pollutants was additionally estimated for each multipollutant model.", "An association between NO<sub>2</sub>, PM10, CO and O<sub>3</sub> exposures and non-accidental and cause-specific deaths was found in one-pollutant models. NO<sub>2</sub> effects remained significant in multipollutant models for non-accidental and circulatory deaths. The estimated CRIs suggested that circulatory deaths were mainly associated with NO<sub>2</sub>, and respiratory deaths mainly with CO and O<sub>3</sub>, regardless the lag. For non-accidental deaths, multipollutant models were associated with the highest CRI, with the main pollutants depending on the chosen lag.", "The results suggest that air pollution mixtures represented by NO<sub>2</sub> have an effect on non-accidental and circulatory mortality, which is independent from PM10, CO and O<sub>3</sub>.
