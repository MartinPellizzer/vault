The results showed that the absolute value of correlation coefficients between the O<sub>3</sub>-8h and related key prediction factors was mainly among 0.2 and 0.507. The 1 000 hPa relative humidity (RH<sub>1000</sub>), wind direction (WD<sub>1000</sub>), and 875 hPa meridional wind (<i>v</i><sub>875</sub>) showed a good indicative effect on the O<sub>3</sub>-8h, with the absolute correlation value exceeding 0.4. The three prediction models could predict the seasonal variation in the O<sub>3</sub>-8h in Haikou, which was larger in the winter half year and smaller in the summer half year. The root mean square error(RMSE) was the smallest (22.29 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) in the BPNN model. The correlation coefficients between the predicted values of three statistical models and observations were ranked as 0.733 (BPNN) &gt; 0.724 (SVM) &gt; 0.591 (MLR), all passing the 99.9% significance test. For the prediction of the O<sub>3</sub>-8h level, we found that TS scores of these three prediction models decreased with the increase in O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration level. Relatively, the point over rate and not hit rate increased with the rise in O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration level. TS scores of the SVM and BPNN model were relatively larger than those of MLR, especially in the light pollution level with TS scores remaining above 70%, indicating a better prediction capability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China Sea Meteorological Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Hainan Province, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Chuan-Bo", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Meteorological Observatory, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jian-Xing", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Meteorological Observatory, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Jia-Xiang", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38629517", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202306035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
