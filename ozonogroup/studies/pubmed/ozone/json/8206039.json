The estimation of sample size for longitudinal studies requires the expected rates of change among the exposed and unexposed, the variance of the outcome, and the correlation of measurements taken within an individual. Methods of analysis whose primary interest is in the combination of cross-sectional studies for the determination of the marginal distribution of the outcome are particularly appropriate for biological processes where the effect of exposure is acute. Conditional models are particularly useful for investigating the effect of changes in exposure on changes in outcome at the individual level. In addition, conditional models incorporate a dampening effect of exposure that may provide a reasonable agreement with several biological mechanisms. The identification of susceptible individuals and the description of the behavior of their outcomes over time may be better accomplished by using the within-individual variance as the outcome of interest. Discrepancies of the within- and between-individual regressions may be suggestive of chronic effects, and methodological research in this area is needed. Studies of the health effects of ozone exposure need to address the incorporation of missing data, measurement error, and the combination of complementary studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mu\u00f1oz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Interpretation, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Biometrics. 1979 Dec;35(4):795-802", "ArticleIdList": ["526525"]}, {"Citation": "Biometrics. 1982 Dec;38(4):963-74", "ArticleIdList": ["7168798"]}, {"Citation": "Stat Med. 1985 Oct-Dec;4(4):457-67", "ArticleIdList": ["4089350"]}, {"Citation": "Biometrics. 1986 Mar;42(1):121-30", "ArticleIdList": ["3719049"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1990 Nov;132(5):847-56", "ArticleIdList": ["2239899"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1989 Sep;130(3):530-9", "ArticleIdList": ["2669471"]}, {"Citation": "Stat Med. 1990 May;9(5):505-14", "ArticleIdList": ["2190287"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1990 Oct;132(4):685-700", "ArticleIdList": ["2403109"]}, {"Citation": "Stat Med. 1988 Jan-Feb;7(1-2):59-71", "ArticleIdList": ["3353613"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8206039", "PMC1519699", "10.1289/ehp.101-1519699"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
