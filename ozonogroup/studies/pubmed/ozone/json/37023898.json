However, IVOCs in air in various indoor environments have not been characterized yet. In this study, we characterized and measured IVOCs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), in residential indoor air in Ottawa, Canada. IVOCs, including n-alkanes, branched-chain alkanes (b-alkanes), unspecified complex mixtures (UCM) IVOCs, and oxygenated IVOCs (such as fatty acids), were found to have a large impact on indoor air quality. The results indicate that the indoor IVOCs behave differently from those in the outdoor environment. IVOCs in the studied residential air ranged from 14.4 to 69.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, with a geometric mean of 31.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, accounting for approximately 20% of the total organic compounds (IVOCs, VOCs and SVOCs) in indoor air. The total b-alkanes and UCM-IVOCs were found to have statistically significant positive correlations with indoor temperature but have no correlations with airborne particulate matter less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) as well as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration. However, indoor oxygenated IVOCs behaved differently from b-alkanes and UCM-IVOCs, with a statistically significant positive correlation with indoor relative humidity but no correlation with other indoor environmental conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2023.
