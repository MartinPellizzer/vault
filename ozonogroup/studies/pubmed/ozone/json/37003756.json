We employ the x-ray absorption benchmark of organic molecule (XABOOM) set, consisting of 116 transitions from mostly organic molecules [Fransson et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17, 1618 (2021)]. Several approximations to a full-valence active space are examined and benchmarked. Absolute excitation energies and intensities computed with the GAS-DSRG truncated to second-order in perturbation theory are found to systematically underestimate experimental and reference theoretical values. Third-order perturbative corrections significantly improve the accuracy of GAS-DSRG absolute excitation energies, bringing the mean absolute deviation from experimental values down to 0.32\u00a0eV. The ozone molecule and glyoxylic acid are particularly challenging for second-order perturbation theory and are examined in detail to assess the importance of active space truncation and intruder states."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4318-5466"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Cherry Emerson Center for Scientific Computation, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7917-6652"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Cherry Emerson Center for Scientific Computation, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."}], "LastName": "Evangelista", "ForeName": "Francesco A", "Initials": "FA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "3"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37003756", "10.1063/5.0137096"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
