This data was compared with respiratory system impedence spectra of 24 normal rats obtained in the same manner. When compared with control, the real part (effective resistance) was significantly different at several frequencies in the 7-day group (P less than 0.05), and group means were higher at all frequencies. The 20-day group showed no significant differences in effective resistance. The imaginary part (effective reactance) was significantly lower at higher frequencies (f greater than 36) in both exposure groups (P less than 0.05). When the impedance curves for each individual were fit to a lumped six-parameter model, and the parameters were compared, only the peripheral resistance parameter of the 7-day group was significantly different from control (P less than 0.05). We conclude that ozone exposure at this level causes changes in respiratory system impedance, that these changes consist primarily of decreased reactances at higher frequencies, and that at 7 days these changes can be modeled by an increase in peripheral resistance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotlikoff", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jackson", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watson", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-006281", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-26606", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomechanical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6693319", "10.1152/jappl.1984.56.1.182"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
