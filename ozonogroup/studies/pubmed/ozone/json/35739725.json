This article provides an updated overview of ClO<sub>2</sub>-based oxidation processes used in water treatment. A systematic review of scientific information and experimental data on ClO<sub>2</sub>-based water purification procedures is presented. Concerning ClO<sub>2</sub>-based oxidation derivative problems, the pros and cons of ClO<sub>2</sub>-based combined processes are assessed and disinfection by-product (DBP) control approaches are proposed. The kinetic and mechanistic data on ClO<sub>2</sub> reactivity towards micropollutants are discussed. ClO<sub>2</sub> selectively reacts with electron-rich moieties (anilines, phenols, olefins, and amines) and eliminates certain inorganic ions and microorganisms with high efficiency. The formation of chlorite and chlorate during the oxidation process is a crucial concern when utilizing ClO<sub>2</sub>. Future applications include the combination of ClO<sub>2</sub> with ferrous ions, activated carbon, ozone, UV, visible light, or persulfate processes. The combined process can reduce by-product generation while still ensuring ClO<sub>2</sub> sterilization and disinfection. Overall, this research could provide useful information and new insights into the application of ClO<sub>2</sub>-based technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
