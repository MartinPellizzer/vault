A three-step MRI protocol was designed and applied to each animal, including: 1) (3)He gas distribution images acquired at inspiratory capacity, 2) measurements of intrapulmonary (3)He diffusion coefficients, and 3) dynamic ventilation acquisitions performed during lung filling with (3)He.", "No differentiation between animals exposed to ozone and control animals was observed from the ventilation images obtained at inspiratory capacity. The (3)He diffusion coefficients were not statistically different from one group to another. Ventilation defects, appearing as delayed lung filling regions and heterogeneous lung filling, were observed in the dynamic lung ventilation image series. The percentage of animals with ventilation defects in the control, two-day, and six-day exposed groups were equal to 20%, 43% and 75%, respectively. In the subgroup of the animals exposed six days for 12 hours per day, the percentage of animals exhibiting ventilation defects was equal to 85%.", "Heterogeneous obstructive patterns in an experimental animal model of subchronic ozone exposure were observed using HP (3)He MRI."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Laboratoire de Resonance Magn\u00e9tique Nucleaire (CREATIS-LRMN), Lyon, France. yannick.cremillieux@univ-lyon1.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cr\u00e9millieux", "ForeName": "Yannick", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Servais", "ForeName": "St\u00e9phane", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berthez\u00e8ne", "ForeName": "Yves", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dupuich", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boussouar", "ForeName": "Aur\u00e9lien", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stupar", "ForeName": "Vasile", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pequignot", "ForeName": "Jean-Marc", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Magn Reson Imaging", "NlmUniqueID": "9105850", "ISSNLinking": "1053-1807"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "206GF3GB41", "NameOfSubstance": "Helium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Helium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18383246", "10.1002/jmri.21216"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
