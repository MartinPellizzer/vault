Here we show that graphitic carbon nitride (C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, a famous visible-light-responsive photocatalyst) is chemically stable toward ozone and superoxide radical; in contrast, hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) can tear the heptazine unit directly from C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> to form cyameluric acid and further release nitrates into the aqueous environment. The ratios of released nitrogen from nanosheet-structured C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and bulk C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> that finally exists in the form of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reach 9.5 and 6.8 mol % in initially ultrapure water, respectively, after 10 h treatment by solar photocatalytic ozonation, which can rapidly generate abundant <sup>\u2022</sup>OH to attack C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. On a positive note, in the presence of organic pollutants which compete against C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> for <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, the C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> decomposition has been completely or partially blocked; therefore, the stability of C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> under practical working conditions has been obviously preserved. This work supplements the missing knowledge of the chemical instability of C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> toward <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and calls for attention to the potential deactivation and secondary pollution of catalysts in <sup>\u2022</sup>OH-involved water treatment processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Division of Environment Technology and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jiadong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Division of Environment Technology and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Qingzhen", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5592-9883"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Division of Environment Technology and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yongbing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Division of Environment Technology and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Division of Environment Technology and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Qiaozhi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Division of Environment Technology and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5968-9357"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Division of Environment Technology and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Hongbin", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7782-42-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Graphite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Graphite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29064241", "10.1021/acs.est.7b04215"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
