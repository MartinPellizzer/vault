Tests conducted in synthetic wastewater using two different ozone gas concentration (4 and 8\u202fg (nm<sup>3</sup>)) and 6 different catalyst loads provided ratios of 0.08, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.32. Results from the experiments indicated that the ratio of 0.11 was optimal and reached residual disinfection below 2\u202fMPN\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> from the initial concentration of 5\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>5</sup>\u202fMPN\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> and removal of atrazine (ATZ) above 80% from the initial concentration of 100\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> for an ozone dose of 41-45\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>. Catalytic ozonation with the selected materials enhanced disinfection and ATZ removal from synthetic wastewater (SWW) in comparison to non-catalytic ozonation by making the treatment performance less sensitive to increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>) in the matrix. Validation of the results in real wastewater effluents confirmed that catalytic ozonation enhanced disinfection. Catalytic ozonation using Polonite\u00ae and AL-1010S provided residual bacteria level of 0.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42\u202fMPN\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.29\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.41\u202fMPN\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>, while non-catalytic ozonation lead to an average residual bacteria level of 1.26\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09\u202fMPN\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> for the same range of transferred ozone dose. However, under the conditions tested, a limited number of CECs were extracted at levels above the limits of quantification and further validation work required to evaluate the performance of catalytic ozonation for the removal of CECs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
