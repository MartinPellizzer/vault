The phytotron experiment was performed over two vegetation periods, adding the pathogen at the end of the first growing season. Root biomass data suggest that the combined treatment affected spruce more than beech and that the negative influence of ozone on stress tolerance against the root pathogen P. citricola was greater for spruce than for beech. In contrast, beech was more affected when the pathogen was the sole stressor. The functional soil parameter chosen for studies of MR soil samples was activity of extracellular enzymes. After the first year of ozone exposure, MR soil samples of both species showed increased activity of almost all measured enzymes (acid phosphatase, chitinase, beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase) in the O3 treatment. Species-specific differences were observed, with a stronger effect of P. citricola on beech MR and a stronger ozone effect on spruce MR. In the second year, the effects of the combined treatment (ozone and P. citricola) were a significant increase in the activity of most enzymes (except cellobiohydrolase) for both tree species. The results indicated that responsiveness of MR soils towards ozone and P. citricola was related to the severity of infection of the plants and the reduction of belowground biomass, suggesting a strong, direct influence of plant stress on MR soil enzyme activity. Additional research is needed using different species and combined stresses to determine the broader ecological relevance of shifts in rhizosphere enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Soil Ecology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstrasse 1, 85758 Oberschleissheim, Germany. pritsch@gsf.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pritsch", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luedemann", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hartmann", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schloter", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scherb", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grams", "ForeName": "T E E", "Initials": "TE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytophthora"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Picea"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16388476", "10.1055/s-2005-872972"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
