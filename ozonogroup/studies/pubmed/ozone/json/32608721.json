One-hundred-seven VOCs species were measured by cryogenic pre-concentration and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The ozone generation potential (OFP) of VOCs was estimated by maximum incremental reactivity (MIR). Results showed that the average volume fraction of VOCs was (22.1\u00b113.1)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. Alkanes and alkenes from C2-C4 as well as acetone and ethyl acetate were the predominant species, accounting for 59.8%-75.8% of TVOCs. The mean volume fraction in the industrial zone was the largest[(28.4\u00b113.5)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>], followed by the scenic zone[(21.7\u00b14.4)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>] and the traffic and residential mixed zone[(20.8\u00b17.2)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>]. The concentration of VOCs in autumn was significantly higher than that in summer. The industrial zone was the site with the highest volume fraction in autumn (35.4\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>), while the scenic zone had the highest volume fraction in summer (21.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>). Alkane, sulfur, or oxygen containing compounds and halogenated hydrocarbons were the predominant components of VOCs, accounting for 35.3%, 26.9%, and 15.6% of the total amount, respectively. Due to industrial emissions, the content of sulfur or oxygen containing compounds in the industrial zone was significantly higher than that in scenic zone and the traffic and residential mixed zone. The average ratio of T/B (toluene/benzene) indicated that vehicle and solvent use were the main sources of VOCs in the urban area. The highest OFP was found in the industrial zone, followed by the traffic and residential mixed zone and the scenic zone. Alkenes and aromatics were the largest contributors to OFP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Academy of Environmental Science, Nanjing 210036, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Nanjing 210019, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Yue-Zhen", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Academy of Environmental Science, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Academy of Environmental Science, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui-Peng", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Province Academy of Environmental Science, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qiu-Yue", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608721", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201908186"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
