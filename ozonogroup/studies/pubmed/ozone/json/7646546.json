R- and S-cyclophosphamides (CPs) were treated with ozone and hydrogen peroxide to yield Rp- and Sp-cis-4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamides (Rp- and Sp-cis-4-HO2-CP); reduction of each hydroperoxide gave the corresponding enantiomer of AP [along with its tautomer 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-HO-CP)]. In separate experiments, K562 cells embedded in agarose gel threads were perfused at pH 7.4, 21 +/- 1 degrees, with solutions of 1.4 mM Rp- and Sp-4-HO-CP/AP, both with and without added mesna (an acrolein scavenger). A comparison of the 31P NMR spectral data derived from the experiments revealed little statistical difference (+/- 10-20% error limits) in the normalized intensities of the CBP peaks arising from the individual AP enantiomers [with added mesna, the ratio Rp-CBP:Sp-CBP was 1.00:1.24 +/- 0.13 (average deviation); without mesna, the same ratio was 1.00:1.35]. Using conventional methods for evaluating the in vitro drug toxicities, CP-resistant L1210 cells were treated in separate experiments with Rp- and Sp-cis-4-HO2-CP; there were no significant differences between the toxicities exhibited by the stereoisomers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Habib", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boal", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hilton", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ludeman", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA16783", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA37323", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoramide Mustards"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7AM2ILM9FI", "NameOfSubstance": "aldophosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DP4677AX41", "NameOfSubstance": "carboxyphosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NR7O1405Q9", "NameOfSubstance": "Mesna"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesna"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoramide Mustards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7646546", "10.1016/0006-2952(95)00133-k", "0006-2952(95)00133-K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
