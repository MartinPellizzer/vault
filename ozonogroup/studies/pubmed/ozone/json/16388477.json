In turn, microbial communities in the rhizosphere rely on carbohydrates provided by the host plant. This paper presents the first study on ozone effects in the plant-rhizosphere-bulk soil system of 4-year-old beech trees using outdoor lysimeters as a research platform. The lysimeters were filled with homogenized soil from the corresponding horizons of a forest site, thus minimizing field heterogeneity. Four lysimeters were treated with ambient ozone (1 x O3) and four with double ambient ozone concentrations (2 x O3; restricted to 150 ppb). In contrast to senescence, which was almost unaffected by ozone treatment, both the photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) and leaf gas exchange were reduced (11 - 45 %) under the elevated O3 regime. However, due to large variation between the plants, no statistically significant O3 effect was found. Even though the amount of primary metabolites, such as sugar and starch, was not influenced by elevated O3 concentrations, the reduced photosynthetic performance was reflected in leaf biochemistry in the form of a reduction in soluble phenolic metabolites. The rhizosphere microbial community also responded to the O3 treatment. Both community structure and function were affected, with a tendency towards a lower diversity and a significant reduction in the potential nutrient turnover. In contrast, litter degradation was unaffected by the fumigation, indicating that in situ microbial functionality of the bulk soil did not change."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Soil Ecology, GSF--National Research Center for Environment and Health, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstrasse 1, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany. schloter@gsf.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schloter", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winkler", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aneja", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koch", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fleischmann", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pritsch", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heller", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grams", "ForeName": "T E E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f6ttlein", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Munch", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16388477", "10.1055/s-2005-872987"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
