Although reducing onroad emissions by 90% produces the largest change in ozone concentrations, the results also suggest that the ozone photochemical regime becomes more NOx-sensitive as emissions from major regional sectors like onroad transportation continue to decline. Despite being highly localized and variable, emissions from HEDD EGUs can have an added impact on reducing ambient ozone concentrations. As the ozone production regime in the region shifts from VOC-sensitive to NOx-sensitive, the impacts of NOx-titration in the urban core weaken and ozone is more likely to decline with a decrease in NOx emissions such as from HEDD units."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karambelas", "ForeName": "Alexandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "Paul J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, Concord, New Hampshire, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Underhill", "ForeName": "Jeffrey", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pleim", "ForeName": "Jonathan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Albany, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zalewsky", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "District of Columbia Department of Energy and Environment, Washington, District of Columbia, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jakuta", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39186664", "10.1080/10962247.2024.2396400"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
