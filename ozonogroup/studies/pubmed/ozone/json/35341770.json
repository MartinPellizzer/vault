A study was carried out to elucidate ambient sources of VOCs in the Capital Region of New York State for the period 2015-2019. A combined dataset of VOCs and PM<sub>2.5</sub> species was used in positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to better interpret the complex nature of different sources. Ten sources were revealed, where background source (3.8\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 30%) was the largest contributor to VOCs, followed by petroleum-related emissions (2.9\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 22%) and pyrolyzed oxygen (OP)-Elemental Carbon (EC2)-aldehydes-rich (2.7\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 21%). Other notable VOC sources included methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)-rich, vehicular traffic, and biomass burning. Both OP-EC2-aldehydes-rich and petroleum-related emissions showed notable contribution to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, respectively. Observed mean carcinogenic risk values of benzene and formaldehyde and 95th percentiles risk values of 1,3-butadiene and acetaldehyde were above the USEPA acceptable level of 1x10<sup>-6</sup> but below a tolerable risk of 1x10<sup>-4</sup>. Estimated carcinogenic risk values of OP-EC2-aldehydes-rich, vehicular traffic, background and petroleum-related emissions were above the USEPA acceptable cancer risk and posed greater risk to public health (more than 80% of total carcinogenic risk) compared to other sources. Due to lack of some VOC species data (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, terpenes, alcohols), other urban VOC sources e.g., fugitive emissions, fuel evaporation, unburned fuel were not identified. More work is needed to better understand the contribution of VOC sources to O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation in Albany and surrounding region. Findings can support policy makers in developing appropriate air quality management initiatives for the Capital Region in New York State."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
