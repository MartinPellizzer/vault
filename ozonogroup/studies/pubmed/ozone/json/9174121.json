Both enzymes are proposed to have an antioxidant role in protecting cells and tissues from oxidative burden. To explore the effects of ozone (O3), the major oxidant in photochemical smog, on the expression of GGT and HO-1 genes in the lung, we exposed rats to 0.4 ppm O3 for up to 7 days. After exposures, mRNA levels of GGT and HO-1 in the lung were measured by RNA blot analysis. Although a 1-day exposure did not change either GGT or HO-1 mRNA levels in the lung, both genes responded to prolonged exposure to O3. GGT mRNA was increased to 149% (P < 0.01) and 158% (P < 0.01) of the control by 3- and 7-day exposures, respectively. HO-1 mRNA was also elevated to 174% (P < 0.01) and 184% (P < 0.001) of the control after 3- and 7-day exposures, respectively. The elevation of GGT and HO-1 mRNA after prolonged exposure to O3 suggests that expression of these genes is not involved in the acute respiratory response, but in the recovery process from lung damage induced by O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Sciences Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshimi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mochitate", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.2.2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9174121", "10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00104-4", "S0006-2952(97)00104-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
