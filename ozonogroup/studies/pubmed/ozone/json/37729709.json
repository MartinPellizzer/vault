We included a total of 14990 singleton pregnancies from the Fujian Birth Cohort Study. During pregnancy, fetal growth parameters including estimated fetal weight (EFW), femur length (FL), head circumference (HC), and abdominal circumference (AC). To investigate the associations between ozone exposure and the above-mentioned outcomes, generalized estimating equation approach and generalized linear regression were used, as appropriate. In the adjusted models, we observed that the Z scores of EFW (-0.031 (-0.048, -0.014)), FL (-0.021 (-0.038, -0.004)), and AC (-0.025 (-0.042, -0.007)) decreased with per interquartile range (IQR) increase of ozone concentration. Compared to participants with low ozone exposure and high NDVI, those with high ozone exposure and low NDVI experienced the largest decrease in Z scores for EFW (-0.049 (-0.079, -0.02)), FL (-0.034 (-0.063, -0.004)), HC (-0.034 (-0.065, -0.004)), and AC (-0.041 (-0.072, -0.01)), respectively. Interestingly, we discovered the effect modification of NDVI on the relationship between ozone exposure and fetal growth restriction (P for interaction < 0.05). This study established a negative relationship of maternal ozone exposure and fetal growth. Of importance, this study discovered the joint effect and interaction between ozone and residential greenness exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
