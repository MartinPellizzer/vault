For urban stations, both O<sub>3</sub>_1\u202fh and O<sub>3</sub>_8\u202fh increased stably with a clear and significant linear pattern and the increase rate was notably higher during the period of May to Sep. Meanwhile, the variation of O<sub>3</sub>_1\u202fh and O<sub>3</sub>_8\u202fh for the DL station did not demonstrate a regular pattern. During this period, the differences between the diurnal peak of ozone concentrations at the DL background station and urban stations decreased significantly due to the rapid urbanization of Beijing. Furthermore, we examined simultaneous variations of ozone and its precursors during 2015 Grand Military Parade and 2014 APEC meeting and evaluated the performances of different emission-reduction measures during the two specific events. For 2015 Grand Military Parade, emission-reduction measures were implemented 14 days in advance, which led to a notable decrease of ozone concentrations during the Parade period. For 2014 APEC meeting, emission-reduction measures were not implemented in advance, which led to incomplete VOCs reduction and high VOCs/NO<sub>x</sub> values, and thus a significant increase of ozone concentrations during the APEC period. The emission-reduction measures during APEC and PARADE periods both slowed down the accumulation and cut down the concentration peaks of ozone. We also analyzed simultaneous concentration variations of ozone and its precursors in long time-series. The results proved that compared with other precursors, NO<sub>2</sub>/NO was an effective indicator for ozone concentration in Beijing, especially in urban areas. The findings from this research provide useful reference for better monitoring and managing ozone concentrations in Beijing and other cities through properly designed and implemented emission-reduction measures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
