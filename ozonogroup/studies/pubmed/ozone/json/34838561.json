To investigate the ozonation by-products formation and control efficiency, a continuous pilot-scale system was established including conventional treatment and ozone-biological activated carbon (O<sub>3</sub>-BAC) treatment processes in a waterworks that receives bromide-bearing source water from the Yellow River in northern China. It was found that ozonation could reduce the threshold odour number and the haloacetic acids formation potential effectively. As 1.8-2.6\u00a0mg/L of ozone was applied, the bromate concentration would exceed the standard of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Simultaneously, ozonation led to a large number of formaldehyde, methylglyoxal and other aldehydes. At the ozone dosage of 3.0\u00a0mg/L, the total concentration of aldehydes reached the highest of 45.4\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) addition could inhibit the formation of bromate effectively. The application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced an increase in aldehydes concentration reaching a maximum concentration of 57.6\u00a0\u03bcg/L. During the BAC treatment, the removal rate of aldehydes would reach 19%-41%. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inhibited the formation of bromate but increased the production of aldehydes, thus it is important to search a balance point for controlling bromate and aldehydes simultaneously. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (g/g) of 1.0 could be possible to control both bromate and aldehydes concentrations within the standards."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
