Herein, we adopted low cost and environmental-friendly TiO<sub>2</sub> as the catalyst of low concentration O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system for high-efficiency NO<sub>x</sub> oxidation. The Ti sites on TiO<sub>2</sub> were the deprotonation sites of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O into Ti-OOH and Ti-OH species, respectively. We found that the surface of rutile phase TiO<sub>2</sub> had a low concentration Ti-OOH component but a large amount of Ti-OH after contacting with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution, thus lots of \u00b7OH and a few O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radicals formed with introducing O<sub>3</sub> molecules. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution induced the formation of a large amount of Ti-OOH and Ti-OH species on the anatase phase TiO<sub>2</sub> surface, thus lots of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generated in the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system. O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and OH radicals could efficiently oxidize NO, in which O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radicals could oxidize NO to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in one step with high selectively. Therefore, anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> had better performance in NO<sub>x</sub> oxidation than rutile phase TiO<sub>2</sub>. The effect of temperature and SO<sub>2</sub> concentration on NO oxidation was also investigated, the results showed that TiO<sub>2</sub>-A/O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system promoted NO oxidation at a low temperature and a low concentration of SO<sub>2</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
