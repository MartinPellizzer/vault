In biological wastewater treatment, microbial processes such as autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification have been identified as major sources; however, the underlying pathways remain unclear. In this study, the mechanisms of N2O production were investigated in a laboratory batch-scale system with activated sludge for treating municipal wastewater. This relatively complex mixed population system is well representative for full-scale activated sludge treatment under nitrifying and denitrifying conditions. Under aerobic conditions, the addition of nitrite resulted in strongly nitrite-dependent N2O production, mainly by nitrifier denitrification of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Furthermore, N2O is produced via hydroxylamine oxidation, as has been shown by the addition of hydroxylamine. In both sets of experiments, N2O production was highest at the beginning of the experiment, then decreased continuously and ceased when the substrate (nitrite, hydroxylamine) had been completely consumed. In ammonia oxidation experiments, N2O peaked at the beginning of the experiment when the nitrite concentration was lowest. This indicates that N2O production via hydroxylamine oxidation is favored at high ammonia and low nitrite concentrations, and in combination with a high metabolic activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (at 2 to 3 mgO2/l); the contribution of nitrifier denitrification by AOB increased at higher nitrite and lower ammonia concentrations towards the end of the experiment. Under anoxic conditions, nitrate reducing experiments confirmed that N2O emission is low under optimal growth conditions for heterotrophic denitrifiers (e.g. no oxygen input and no limitation of readily biodegradable organic carbon). However, N2O and nitric oxide (NO) production rates increased significantly in the presence of nitrite or low dissolved oxygen concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
