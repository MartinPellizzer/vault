Pollutants also have negative effects on other upper airway diseases such as allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis media. Traffic-related air pollutants (diesel exhaust particles and nitrogen dioxide and tobacco smoke) have been widely studied in this context. Increasing evidence suggests that particulate matter, photochemical pollutants, and ozone are associated with such conditions. Young children and the obese are more vulnerable. Work in vivo and in vitro has explored the relationships between pollutants and disease, and possible pathophysiological mechanisms. Reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and inflammation are all in play.", "Traffic-derived materials and tobacco smoke are major air pollutants that aggravate upper airway disease. Novel mechanisms of action have been suggested and risk factors have been defined. However, the data are conflicting, and controlled prospective studies are required."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "aDivision of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital, Bucheon bDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital, Gumi cDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "An-Soo", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jun", "ForeName": "Young Joon", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Moo Kyun", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "100936359", "ISSNLinking": "1473-6322"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Otitis Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Sinusitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26658014", "10.1097/ACI.0000000000000235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
