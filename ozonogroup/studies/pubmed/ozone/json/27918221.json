However, clinical impacts and mechanisms of the neutrophilic inflammation have not been thoroughly evaluated up to date. Areas covered: Currently, distinct clinical manifestations, triggers, and molecular mechanisms of the neutrophilic inflammation (namely Toll-like receptor, Th1, Th17, inflammasome) are under investigation in asthma. Furthermore, possible role of the neutrophilic inflammation is being investigated in respect to the airway remodeling. We searched the related literatures published during the past 10\u00a0years on the website of Pub Med under the title of asthma and neutrophilic inflammation in human. Expert commentary: Epidemiologic and experimental studies have revealed that the neutrophilic airway inflammation is induced by a wide variety of stimuli including ozone, particulate matters, cigarette smoke, occupational irritants, endotoxins, microbial infection and colonization, and aeroallergens. These triggers provoke diverse immune and inflammatory responses leading to progressive and sometimes irreversible airway obstruction. Clinically, neutrophilic airway inflammation is frequently associated with severe asthma and poor response to glucocorticoid therapy, indicating the need for other treatment strategies. Accordingly, therapeutics will be targeted against the main mediators behind the underlying molecular mechanisms of the neutrophilic inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Interdisciplinary Program in Biomedical Science Major , Soonchunhyang Graduate School , Bucheon , Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hun Soo", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Interdisciplinary Program in Biomedical Science Major , Soonchunhyang Graduate School , Bucheon , Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Tae-Hyeong", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Interdisciplinary Program in Biomedical Science Major , Soonchunhyang Graduate School , Bucheon , Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jun", "ForeName": "Ji Ae", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Allergy and Respiratory Disease , Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital , Bucheon , Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Ae Rin", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Allergy and Respiratory Disease , Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital , Bucheon , Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong-Sook", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Division of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine , Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital , Seoul , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Koo", "ForeName": "So-My", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Division of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine , Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital , Seoul , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yang-Ki", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Division of Respiratory Medicine , Soonchunhyang University CheonAn Hospital , Cheonan , Chungcheongnam-do , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ho Sung", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Allergy and Respiratory Disease , Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital , Bucheon , Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Choon-Sik", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Rev Respir Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101278196", "ISSNLinking": "1747-6348"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammasomes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Obstruction"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Remodeling"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammasomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Th17 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27918221", "10.1080/17476348.2017.1268919"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
