Experiments with a laboratory-scale pilot unit suggested that washwater units meant to scrub contaminants from absorber unit exhaust could potentially serve as a source of N-nitrosamines via reactions of residual NO(x) with amines accumulating in the washwater. Dosage requirements for the continuous treatment of the washwater recycle line with ultraviolet (UV) light for destruction of N-nitrosamines and N-nitramines, and with ozone or hydroxyl radical-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for destruction of amines and aldehydes, were evaluated. Although <1000 mJ/cm(2) UV fluence was generally needed for 90% removal of a series of model N-nitrosamines and N-nitramines, 280-1000 mJ/cm(2) average fluence was needed for 90% removal of total N-nitrosamines in pilot washwaters associated with two different solvents. While AOPs were somewhat more efficient than ozone for acetaldehyde destruction, ozone was more efficient for amine destruction. Ozone achieved 90% amine removal in washwaters at 5-12 molar excess of ozone, indicating transferred dosage levels of \u223c100 mg/L for 90% removal in a first-stage washwater unit, but likely only \u223c10 mg/L if applied to a second-stage washwater. Accurate dosage and cost estimates would require pilot testing to capture synergies between UV and ozone treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Yale University, Mason Lab 313b, 9 Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Amisha D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitch", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GJ18911991", "NameOfSubstance": "nitramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23425146", "10.1021/es304893m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
