Norland). A dose-response experiment showed that an EDU concentration of 15 mg l(-1) soil (given as a soil drench) provided complete protection from accelerated foliar senescence induced by exposure to 0.1 microl l(-1) O3 for 5 h day(-1) for 11 days. EDU doses of 45 and 75 mg active ingredient l(-1) soil also gave protection but were associated with symptoms of toxicity and delayed senescence. In further experiments, plants were given 0 or 15 mg EDU l(-1) soil and exposed to clean air or 0.1 microl l(-1) O3 for 5 h day(-1) for 14 days. Chronic O3 exposure in the absence of EDU resulted in accelerated foliar senescence, characterized by early declines in net photosynthesis and Rubisco quantity in O3-treated plants relative to controls. EDU in the presence of O3 gave complete protection against symptoms of accelerated senescence. Senescence was not delayed in plants that received EDU in the absence of O3, and no symptoms of EDU toxicity were evident. The results suggest that EDU-induced tolerance to O3 was not based on 'anti-senescent' properties of this anti-ozonant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Resources Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eckardt", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091382", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)00111-5", "0269749195001115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
