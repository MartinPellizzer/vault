Although surface O<sub>3</sub> is considered as a significant global environmental issue because of its phytotoxicity and greenhouse effect, the knowledge of the dose-response (DR) relationships in poplars for the assessment of O<sub>3</sub> risk is still limited. Hence, this study aimed at collecting data of studies with manipulative O<sub>3</sub> exposures of poplars within FACE (Free Air Concentration Enhancement) and OTC (Open-Top Chamber) facilities. The datasets contain studies on hybrid poplar clones and a non-hybrid native poplar (Populus nigra L.) reporting both AOT40 (Accumulated exposure Over a Threshold of 40\u00a0ppb) and POD1 (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a threshold of 1\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> Projected Leaf Area [PLA] s<sup>-1</sup>) to compare exposure- and flux-based indices. As a result, linear regression analysis showed that the flux-based POD1 was better than the exposure-based AOT40 to explain the biomass response of poplars to O<sub>3</sub>. From the DR relationships, a critical level (CL) of 5.7\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> POD1 has been derived corresponding to 4% biomass growth reduction for hybrid poplar clones, which can be considered very sensitive to O<sub>3</sub>, while the non-hybrid native poplar was less sensitive to O<sub>3</sub> (CL: 10.3\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> POD1), although the potential risk of O<sub>3</sub> for this taxon is still high due to very high stomatal conductance. Moreover, the different experimental settings (OTC vs. FACE) have affected the AOT40-based DR relationships but not the POD1-based DR relationships, suggesting that poplar responses to O<sub>3</sub> were principally explained by stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake regardless of the different experimental settings and exposure patterns. These results highlight the importance of the flux-based approach, especially when scaling up from experimental datasets to the O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment for poplars at the regional or global scale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
