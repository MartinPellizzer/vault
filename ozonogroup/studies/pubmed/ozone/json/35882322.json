All relevant studies from January 1990 to December 2021 were searched from four databases. After screening, 30 studies were included for the meta-analysis. The results showed that a significant rise of 0.41 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.35 %-0.48 %) in all-cause, 0.60 % (95 % CI: 0.51 %-0.68 %) in cardiovascular and 0.45 % (95 % CI: 0.28 %-0.62 %) in respiratory mortality for each 10 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> increase in the maximum daily 8 h average O<sub>3</sub> concentration (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>). Moreover, results stratified by heterogeneous time periods before and after implementing a policy measure in 2013, showed that the pooled effects for all-cause and respiratory mortality before were greater than those after, while the pooled effects for cardiovascular mortality before 2013 were slightly smaller than those after. The finding that short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> was positively related to the three health endpoints was validated by means of a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we did not observe any publication bias. Our results present an updated and better understanding of the relationship between short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and the three health endpoints, while providing a reference for further assessment of the impact of short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure on human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
