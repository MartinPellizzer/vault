However, their operation can still have an environmental footprint. Therefore, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of wastewater treatment provides a comprehensive framework to quantify the environmental impact of plants across various categories. By conducting LCA assessments, the environmental impacts of different scenarios or treatment technologies can be compared, enabling decision-makers to identify the most environmentally friendly options. This information helps in optimizing the plant's design, operation, and resource allocation to minimize their environmental burden. The current research hypothesis was to conduct an LCA of a typical activated sludge plant in Greece, considering three different scenarios in order to provide an innovative take on wastewater treatment plant foam waste and utilize them for the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion. The assessment was carried out using OpenLCA software as well as EcoInvent v3.3. database. The study focused on the impact assessment of five categories (eutrophication potential, acidification potential, global warming potential, ozone depletion, and photochemical ozone creation). The results indicated that the baseline scenario had the highest impact on these categories, followed by Scenario I, while Scenario II had the least impact. Additionally, the cumulative energy demand assessment showed that the baseline scenario required significantly more energy compared to Scenarios I and II. However, Scenario II, which involved fine screens and utilization of biogas, exhibited the highest energy production, thereby reducing the overall energy demands for the system. Based on these findings, it is crucial for wastewater treatment facilities to actively pursue energy demand mitigation strategies by implementing energy-efficient technologies and utilizing biogas. These measures not only contribute to environmental protection but also promote a greener and more sustainable future for WWTP operations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
