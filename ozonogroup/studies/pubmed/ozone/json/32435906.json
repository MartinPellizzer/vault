In this study, 36 patients with chronic inflammatory gingival enlargement underwent gingivectomy and gingivoplasty. The groups were randomly divided into control (n\u2009=\u200912), PBM (n\u2009=\u200912) and ozone (n\u2009=\u200912) groups. GaAlAs diode laser 810\u00a0nm wavelength at a non-contact and continuous mode with a power of 0.3\u00a0W and a density of 4\u00a0J/cm<sup>2</sup> used for PBM for 1\u00a0min. Ozone was applied for 1\u00a0min for every 5\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup> in contact mode at power level 9 using probe number 3. PBM and ozone applications were performed immediately after the operation, on the 3rd and 7th days. Pain assessment was performed at 3rd, 7th, 14th and 28th days after gingivectomy and gingivoplasty by using visual analogue scale (VAS). Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) records were obtained from the patients before gingivectomy and gingivoplasty and postoperative 7th and 14th days. OHIP-14 questions were also evaluated individually. VAS pain levels of the control group measured on the 3rd day were higher than the PBM group and on the 7th day were found to be significantly higher than both groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The total OHIP-14 score of the control group on the 7th postoperative day was found to be higher than the PBM group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The mean score obtained from the third question of OHIP-14 at 7th and 14th day of the PBM group was found to be lower than the control and ozone groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The PBM and ozone applications after gingivectomy and gingivoplasty reduce the pain levels of patients and have a positive effect on patients' quality of life."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9707-1379"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology, Inonu University, 44280, Malatya, Turkey. mustafaozayuslu@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Uslu", "ForeName": "Mustafa \u00d6zay", "Initials": "M\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8486-277X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Malatya \u015eehit Mehmet K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 Oral And Dental Health Hospital, 44280, Malatya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Akg\u00fcl", "ForeName": "Semih", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lasers Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8611515", "ISSNLinking": "0268-8921"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gingivectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gingivoplasty"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Semiconductor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Low-Level Light Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oral Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain, Postoperative"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32435906", "10.1007/s10103-020-03037-8", "10.1007/s10103-020-03037-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
