Herein, heterogeneous ozone oxidation technology is applied to oxidize and degrade printing and dyeing wastewater. A metal oxide catalyst supported on activated carbon (\u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub>/AC) was prepared by hydrothermal synthetic method and shown to enable synergistic catalysis involving MnO<sub>2</sub> metal sites and N/C sites. A simulated methyl orange solution was used to determine the effects of various preparation and operation parameters. The results confirmed that the \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub>/AC catalyst exhibited good chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and reusability. Additionally, \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub>/AC demonstrated excellent degradation of the secondary biochemical effluent of printing and dyeing wastewater (COD removal = 72.45% within 120 min). The \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub>/AC catalyst was fully characterized, and the mechanism governing its catalytic ozone oxidation process was investigated experimentally."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
