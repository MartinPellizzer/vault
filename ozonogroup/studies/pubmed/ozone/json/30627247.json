All patients were randomly divided into two groups: catheter drainage alone (Group I); catheter drainage combined with ozone (Group II). Drainage was considered successful when: 1) the abscess cavities were completely drained, and 2) clinical symptoms were resolved. Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric test was used to compare the success rates, length of stay (LOS), and need of further surgery. A value of <i>p</i> < 0.05 was considered significant for all statistical analyses.", "In all the patients' percutaneous catheters were placed successfully under the guidance of computed tomography. All of the patients in Group I (43; 50.6%) were treated with percutaneous catheter drainage alone, while the patients in Group II (42; 49.4%) were treated with PCD combined with ozone. The success rates of Group I and II were 81% and 94%, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The duration of fever as well as LOS was longer for Group I when compared with Group II (<i>p</i> < 0.05).", "Catheter drainage combined with ozone is an effective and safe treatment in PLA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Key Laboratory of Medical Imaging, Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, P.R.
