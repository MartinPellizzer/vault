Two classes of experimental planning were used: the Doehlert matrix (DM) and the central composite design (CCD). The most important variables for each process were hydrogen peroxide concentration, the ratio of illuminated volume/total volume of the reactor and recirculation flow rate for UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and ozone flow rate, consumed ozone and MB concentration for the ozonation. The DM was more efficient in optimizing the systems, since it used a smaller number of experiments and achieved similar results when compared to the CCD. After optimization, the disinfection efficiency of the systems was tested with secondary effluent evaluating the inactivation of microbiological indicators, Escherichia coli and total coliforms, using the optimized and the worst condition previously obtained with MB removal as response. The inactivation efficiencies in the optimum conditions were about 99%, allowing an efficient disinfection as well as the production of an effluent with quality to be reused according to specific legislations, while at the worse conditions, the inactivation did not reach standards for reuse."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Technology, University of Campinas - UNICAMP , Limeira , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malvestiti", "ForeName": "Jacqueline A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Technology, University of Campinas - UNICAMP , Limeira , Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2409-5070"], "LastName": "Fagnani", "ForeName": "Enelton", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Technology, University of Campinas - UNICAMP , Limeira , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sim\u00e3o", "ForeName": "D\u00e9bora", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Technology, University of Campinas - UNICAMP , Limeira , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dantas", "ForeName": "Renato F", "Initials": "RF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29364054", "10.1080/09593330.2018.1432698"]}}]}
