Cabin levels were detected directly and almost continuously; ambient levels were measured using a sampling system in which the ambient samples were converted to the cabin pressure at intervals of 13 min. A correlation is demonstrated between the ambient level, the cabin level, and the tropopause height. It was found that 70% of the ambient ozone concentration enters the cabin through the ventilation system, and about 50% of this concentration was measured 1.20 m above the cabin floor. For about 50% of the total flying time, the ozone level exceeded 200 parts per billion, by volume (ppb) in the cabin, with peak concentrations of about 600 ppb (TLV levels of 80--100 ppb apply in most IATA countries). Finally, medical and technical recommendations are made for future measurements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Heusden", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mans", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Aviat Space Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7501714", "ISSNLinking": "0095-6562"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["697666"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
