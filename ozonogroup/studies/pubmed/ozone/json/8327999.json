Methyl linoleate ozonide (MLO) (0.07 mmol/100 g body wt.), a model fatty acid ozonide, was administered to female Wistar rats either intravenously or intraperitoneally. After 24 h the rats were killed and the effects were examined. MLO was found to be toxic only after intravenous administration. The major effects were observed in the lungs. The lungs became enlarged from edema and showed severe hemorrhages. Further, total thiol was depleted in serum and lung tissue, accompanied with a significant decrease in activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glutathione S-transferase. The vitamin E levels in serum and lung tissue were reduced. The malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in serum and lung tissue were elevated suggesting that in vivo oxidation had occurred. On intraperitoneal administration of MLO, no effects on enzyme activities, thiol and vitamin E content in lung tissue were observed. In serum, however, as on intravenous administration, an increase of the MDA levels and decreases of total thiol and vitamin E levels were found. In view of the route of administration it is to be expected that the ozonide is partly cleared by the liver, and the ozonide and its potentially toxic products are further detoxicated by vitamin E and thiols in serum before they reach the lung. The above data show that the main target organ for ozonides is the lung, and that the effects caused by MLO in vivo are in many respects similar to the effects found after acute ozone exposure. This supports the working hypothesis that ozonides may play a role in ozone-induced lung toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hempenius", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dellevoet", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marsman", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koeman", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Vries", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Linoleic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H5SRK63OL7", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl linoleate ozonide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Linoleic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8327999", "10.1016/0300-483x(93)90180-z", "0300-483X(93)90180-Z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
