The post transition state (TS) dynamics is studied at temperatures of 400 and 500 K. The PM7 semiempirical method is employed for calculating the potential energy gradient needed for integrating Hamilton's equations of motion. This semiempirical method provides excellent agreement in terms of energy and geometry of the TSs as well as minimum energy states of the system with respect to B3LYP/6-311+G (2df, 2p) calculated results. In the dynamics, first, a peroxyacid is formed, which further dissociates to different fragments. Four major channels forming CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and small carboxylic acid (SCA) fragments are seen in this reaction. Rates of each of the channels and the overall unimolecular reaction are calculated at both temperatures. Branching ratios of all these product channels are calculated and compared with experiment. The minimum energy profile of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and H<sub>2</sub>O channels are calculated. A qualitative estimate of activation energies for all the channels are obtained and compared with the explicit TS energies of three product channels, which ultimately correlate with the reaction probabilities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, Shillong 793003, Meghalaya, India."}], "LastName": "Agarwal", "ForeName": "Ankita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, Shillong 793003, Meghalaya, India."}], "LastName": "Boruah", "ForeName": "Palash Jyoti", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2640-4401"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Eastern Hill University, Shillong 793003, Meghalaya, India."}], "LastName": "Sarkar", "ForeName": "Biplab", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7074-1232"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, Shillong 793003, Meghalaya, India."}], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "Amit K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35943451", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c04028"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
