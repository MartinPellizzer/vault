DOM formulas with carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (CHO-DOM) were the most abundant class in water samples, and over half of them were commonly found at both plants. Among the treatment processes, ozonation induced the most drastic changes to DOM. Mass peak intensities of less saturated CHO-DOM (positive (oxygen subtracted double bond equivalent per carbon (DBE-O)/C)) decreased by ozonation, while more saturated oxidation byproducts (negative (DBE-O)/C) increased and new oxidation byproducts (OBPs) were detected. By Kendrick mass analysis, ozone reactions preferred less saturated CHO-DOM in the same alkylation families and produced more saturated alkylation families of OBPs. Following ozonation, biological activated carbon filtration effectively removed <300 Da CHO-DOM, including OBPs. Following chlorination, over 50 chlorinated formulas of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) were found in chlorinated water samples where at least half were unknown. Putative precursors of these DBPs were determined based on electrophilic substitutions and addition reactions. Ozonation demonstrated better decomposition of addition reaction-type precursors than electrophilic substitution-type precursors; over half of both precursor types decreased during biological activated carbon filtration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Water Environment Technology, School of Engineering , The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo , Tokyo 113-8656 , Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Research Center for Environmental and Hazardous Substance Management , Khon Kaen University , Khon Kaen 40002 , Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management , Bangkok 10330 , Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phungsai", "ForeName": "Phanwatt", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Water Environment Technology, School of Engineering , The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo , Tokyo 113-8656 , Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1567-4852"], "LastName": "Kurisu", "ForeName": "Futoshi", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Engineering, School of Engineering , The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo , Tokyo 113-8656 , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kasuga", "ForeName": "Ikuro", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Water Environment Technology, School of Engineering , The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo , Tokyo 113-8656 , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Furumai", "ForeName": "Hiroaki", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29463082", "10.1021/acs.est.7b04765"]}}]}
