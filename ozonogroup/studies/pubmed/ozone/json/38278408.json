While ozonation and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are commonly employed as disinfection methods in water treatment processes, the degradation of DCF in these processes occurs due to the strong oxidizing activity of the reactive oxygen species produced during both ozonation and UV radiation. Despite extensive studies reporting the removal and transformation of DCF through ozone and UV treatments, the potential hidden hazards of toxicity arising from these processes as well as the identification of the toxic transformation products have often been overlooked. In this study, various toxicities including microtoxicity, genotoxicity and antiestrogenicity were evaluated using multiple in-vitro bioassays. The transformation products were identified via ultra-performance liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Correlation analysis was employed to gain deeper insight into the contributions of degradation products to overall toxicity. The results revealed that DCF possessed significant genotoxic and antiestrogenic effects, but displayed minimal microtoxicity. Microtoxic products such as those containing carbazole were generated during DCF degradation with ozone, UVA and UVC. Antiestrogenic products with dichloroaniline structures were observed in DCF ozonation but not in photodegradation by UVA and UVC. These findings highlighted the hidden risks associated with the disinfection of water containing micropollutants such as DCF."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
