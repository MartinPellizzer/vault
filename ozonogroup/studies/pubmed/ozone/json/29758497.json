Ozone treatment is currently being considered as a tool to expedite remediation, as it is known to degrade toxic organic compounds present in OSPW. In this study, we aimed to measure the effects of OSPW exposure on the growth, development and recovery of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. We also used ozone-treated OSPW to determine whether ozonation negated any effects of raw OSPW exposure. As biomarkers of exposure, we assessed the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment (ngn1, neuroD), estrogenicity (vtg), oxidative stress (sod1), and biotransformation (cyp1a, cyp1b). Our study found that exposure to both raw and ozonated OSPW did not impair growth of zebrafish embryos, however, otoliths of exposed embryos were smaller than those of control embryos. The expression levels of both cyp1a and cyp1b were induced by raw OSPW exposure. However, after the exposure period, expression levels of these genes returned to control levels within two days of residence in clean water. We found no changes in the expression levels of ngn1, neuroD and vtg genes with exposure to treated or untreated OSPW. Overall, our study found that raw OSPW exposure did not have many negative effects on zebrafish embryos and embryos appeared to recover relatively quickly after exposure ended. Furthermore, ozone treatment decreased the induction of cyp1a and cyp1b."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
