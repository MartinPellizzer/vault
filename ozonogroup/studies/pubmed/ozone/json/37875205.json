Three pharmaceuticals were investigated as model CECs, namely carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Experimental results showed that disinfection efficiency of UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment decreased (2.4, 1.8 and 1.3 log reductions of E. coli, initial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dose of 30\u00a0mg/L, 2.5\u00a0min treatment) as the initial concentration of MPs was increased (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0g/L, respectively). Similarly, an increase in MPs concentration (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0g/L) reduced the inactivation (4.7, 4.1 and 3.7 log reductions) of the target bacteria after 60 min of ozonation treatment. Although the disinfection efficiency of both treatment processes was negatively affected by the presence of MPs, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was more effective than the ozonation, despite ozonation being investigated at high doses to better discriminate the effect of MPs. Noteworthy, CECs degradation by UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under realistic operating conditions was affected to some extent by MPs, while a lower effect was observed for ozonation, at not realistic ozone dose."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
