The E-HOC (CA<sup>+</sup>) resulted in higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N removal with most content of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O and gaseous N in product compared with E-HOC (Fe<sup>+</sup>), electrolysis ozonation and single ozonation. Reactive chlorine species (RCS) and coagulants were co-produced by compositing RuO<sub>2</sub>-IrO<sub>2</sub>/Ti and Fe powders, resulting in multiple reactions including electrocoagulation, ozone oxidation, synergistic between ozone and coagulants (SOC), electrolytic chloride and synergistic oxidation between active chlorine and ozone (SCO) occurred. Hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) generated through SOC reaction was promoted due the RCS generation in E-HOC. The interaction between \u2022OH and Cl<sup>-</sup>/ClO<sup>-</sup> also contributed to enhanced Cl\u2022/ClO\u2022 production. Consequently, synergy of chlorine, coagulants and ozone enhanced reactive species generation which contributed to favorable organics and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N removal. Enhanced \u2022OH and RCS are also attributed to conversion of bio-refractory organics like polyphenol, polycyclic aromatics and S-containing to biodegradable ones, e.g., aliphatic compounds and CHO. This study provides an easily operating strategy for leachate treatment with high content organics and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
