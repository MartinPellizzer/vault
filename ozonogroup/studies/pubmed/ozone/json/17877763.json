The outcome variable was defined as all-age asthma hospital admissions with ICD9-493 codes. The ambient air pollutants were average daily measures of ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide, and the airborne particle index representing fine particulate pollution. Semi-parametric Poisson regression models were used to estimate these effects, adjusted for air temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, day-of-the-week effects and seasonal variation.", "Grass pollen was a strong independent non-linear predictor of asthma hospital admissions in a multi-pollutant model (P=0.01). Our data suggest that grass pollen had an increasing effect on asthma hospital admissions up to a threshold of 30 grains/m3, and that the effect remains stable thereafter.", "Our findings suggest that grass pollen levels influence asthma hospital admissions. High grass pollen days, currently defined as more than 50 grains/m3, are days when most sensitive individuals will experience allergic symptoms. However, some asthmatic patients may be at a significant risk even when airborne grass pollen levels are below this level. Patients with pollen allergies and asthma would be advised to take additional preventive medication at lower ambient concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Molecular Environmental Genetic Analytic Epidemiology, School of Population Health, University of Melbourne, Carlton, Vic., Australia. b.erbas@latrobe.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erbas", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "J-H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dharmage", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "E K", "Initials": "EK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyndman", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newbigin", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abramson", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "8906443", "ISSNLinking": "0954-7894"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17877763", "10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02818.x", "CEA2818"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
