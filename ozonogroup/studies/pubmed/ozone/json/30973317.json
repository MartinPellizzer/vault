The site chosen for the present study has high potential for ozone generation sources, such as vehicular traffic and industrial activities. The site is also located near a hazardous waste management facility. The key sources of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), which are considered to be an important precursor of O<sub>3</sub>, include hazardous waste incineration, trucks bringing the hazardous wastes, and vehicles plying on the nearby National Highway 16 (NH 16). The measurements clearly showed diurnal variation, with maximum values observed during the noon hours and minimum values observed when solar radiation was less. The data showed a marked seasonal variation in O<sub>3</sub>, with the highest hourly average O<sub>3</sub> concentration (497.2 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) in the summer season. Consequently, in order to identify the long-range transport sources adding to the increased O<sub>3</sub> levels, backward trajectories were computed using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. It was found that the polluted air mass originated from the Southeast Asian region and the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The polluted air mass, which advected large amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) plumes, was analyzed using the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) retrievals. The correlations of O<sub>3</sub> with temperature (<i>r</i> =\u00a00.746; <i>P</i> <\u00a00.01) and solar radiation (<i>r</i> =\u00a00.751; <i>P</i> <\u00a00.01) were strongly positive, and that with NO<sub>x</sub> was found to be negative. Stronger correlation of O<sub>3</sub> with NO<sub>x</sub> was observed during pre-monsoon months (<i>r</i> =\u00a00.627; <i>P</i> <\u00a00.01) and following hours of photochemical reactions. There were substantial differences in concentrations between weekdays and weekends, with higher nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), but lower O<sub>3</sub>, concentrations on weekdays. A substantial weekday-weekend difference in O<sub>3</sub>, which was higher on weekends, appears to be attributable to lower daytime traffic activity and hence reduced emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> to a \"NO<sub>x</sub>-saturated\" atmosphere. <i>Implications</i>: The assessment of ground-level ozone in an industrial area with hazardous waste management facility is very important, as there is high possibility for more generation of tropospheric ozone. Since the location of the study area is coastal, wind plays a major role in O<sub>3</sub> transportation; hence, the effects of wind speed and wind direction have been studied in different seasons. When compared with the other studies carried out in different places across India, the present study area has recorded much greater O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratio. This study can be useful for setting up control strategies in such industrial areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Division, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras , Chennai , Tamil Nadu , India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Division, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras , Chennai , Tamil Nadu , India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saranya", "ForeName": "Packiam", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30973317", "10.1080/10962247.2019.1604451"]}}]}
