To identify the possible mechanism and response of leaf morphological, antioxidant, and anatomical characteristics to elevated atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> (EO<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, we exposed three-year-old I. decorus seedlings to three O<sub>3</sub> levels (low O<sub>3</sub>-LO: ambient air; medium O<sub>3</sub>-MO: Ambient air+70\u00a0ppb high O<sub>3</sub>-HO: Ambient air+140\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub>) over a growing season using open-top chambers. Leaf shape and stomatal characteristics, and leaf microscopic structure of I. decorus were examined. The results indicated that 1) the stomata O<sub>3</sub> flux (F<sub>st</sub>) of HO decreased more rapidly under EO<sub>3</sub> as the exposure time increased. The foliar O<sub>3</sub> injury of HO and MO occurred when AOT40 was 26.62\u00a0ppm\u00a0h and 33.20\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, respectively, 2) under EO<sub>3</sub>, leaf number, leaf mass per area, leaf area, and stomata length/width all decreased, while leaf thickness, stomatal density, width, and area increased compared to the control, 3) MDA and total soluble protein contents all showed significantly increase under HO (36.57% and 32.77%) and MO(31.91% and 19.52%) while proline contents only increased under HO(33.27%). 4) MO and HO increased bulliform cells numbers in the leaves by 6.28% and 23.01%, respectively. HO reduced the transverse area of bulliform cells by 13.73%, while MO treatments had no effect, and 5) the number of fusoid cells interspace, the transverse area of fusoid cells interspace, and mesophyll thickness of HO significantly increased by 11.16%, 28.58%, and 13.42%, respectively. In conclusion, I. decorus exhibits strong O<sub>3</sub> tolerance characteristics, which stem from adaptions in the leaf's morphological, structural, antioxidant, and anatomical features. One critical attribute was the enlargement of the bulliform cell transverse area and the transverse area of fusoid cells interspace that drove this resistance to O<sub>3</sub>. Local bamboo species with high resistance to O<sub>3</sub> pollution thus need to be promoted for sustained productivity and ecosystem services in areas with high O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
