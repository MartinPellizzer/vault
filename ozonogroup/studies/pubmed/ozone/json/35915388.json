Therefore, an effective treatment is imperative to overcome this issue. This research study investigates the effectiveness of zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl<sub>4</sub> ) and tin tetrachloride (SnCl<sub>4</sub> ) as a coagulant in leachate treatment. Two parameters selected as a performance indicator in this study are color and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The data obtained showed that SnCl<sub>4</sub> performed well as a coagulant with removal percentages of color and COD, which are 97% and 77%, respectively. Furthermore, the potential of integrated treatment using ozonation (O<sub>3</sub> ) and the coagulation-flocculation process was also investigated. Four sequences of integrated treatment setup for this study were ozonation followed by jar test (ZrCl<sub>4</sub> as a coagulant), ozonation followed by jar test (SnCl<sub>4</sub> as a coagulant), jar test (ZrCl<sub>4</sub> as a coagulant) followed by the ozonation process, and jar test (SnCl<sub>4</sub> as a coagulant) followed by the ozonation process. The experimental data showed that the combination treatment of SnCl<sub>4</sub> as a coagulant (jar test) followed by the ozonation process had recorded the highest removal of color (97.1%) and COD (88%) compared to other sequences. Moreover, the biodegradability ratio of this sequence also improved from 0.03 to 0.28, compared with other methods. Comparatively, integrated treatment is more effective in treating stabilized landfill leachate compared to the coagulation flocculation process alone. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Stabilized landfill leachate is difficult to be treated by natural coagulants or biological process. SnCl<sub>4</sub> performed well as a coagulant in removing COD and colour from landfill leachate compared to ZrCl<sub>4</sub> . However, too much usage of SnCl<sub>4</sub> potentially generate secondary pollutant. Therefore, combination with O<sub>3</sub> as pre-treatment is investigated. Combination treatment of SnCl<sub>4</sub> ( as coagulant) with O<sub>3</sub> had recorded the highest removal of colour (97.1%) and COD (88%). The biodegradability ratio of this sequence also improved from 0.03 to 0.28."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Water Environment Federation."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1405-7246"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Zakaria", "ForeName": "Siti Nor Farhana", "Initials": "SNF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6287-0560"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering, Engineering Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Solid Waste Management Cluster, Science and Technology Research Centre, Engineering Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Abdul Aziz", "ForeName": "Hamidi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7490-0971"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Technology Management and Logistics, College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mohamad", "ForeName": "Maheera", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "American Public Health Association (APHA).
