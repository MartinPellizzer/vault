However, the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in this relationship is still not fully understood.", "We investigated if individual and contextual SES modified the relationship between short-term exposure to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 \u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>) on cardiovascular, respiratory, and all nonaccidental mortality.", "We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study. Analyses were based on information on 280,685 deaths from 2011 to 2015 in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. Education was used as an individual SES, and information on the district of residence was used to build a contextual SES. Exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2,</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was accessed from monitoring stations and linked to each case based on the date of death. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of air pollutants, and interaction terms were added to access the effect modification of SES.", "Individuals with lower education had an increased chance of dying for all nonaccidental outcomes (1.54% [0.91%, 2.14%]) associated with exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>. Individuals living in lower SES areas had an increased chance of dying for nonaccidental (0.52% [0.16%, 0.88%]), cardiovascular (1.17% [0.88%, 1.46%]), and respiratory (1.70% [0.47%, 2.93%]) causes owing to NO<sub>2</sub> exposure.", "Exposure to air pollutants increases the chance of dying by nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes.
