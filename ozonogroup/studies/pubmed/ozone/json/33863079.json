Biomass was evaluated following 3,5,7 and 13 wk exposure. Biomass following 13 wk exposure also included weekly harvests of mature tomato fruit beginning week 8. Carbon dioxide enrichment significantly enhanced total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest, as well as cumulative yield of mature fruit, whereas O<sub>3</sub> significantly suppressed total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest and reduced total cumulative fruit yield. The magnitude of these changes varied with the development of tomato from early growth to mature fruit yield. Carbon dioxide enrichment reduced the detrimental effects of O<sub>3</sub> on total vegetative plant d. wt of tomato following 3, 5, 7 and 13 wk exposure. Final mature fruit yield was 24% higher under enriched GO<sub>2</sub> treatments than in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> . Ozone suppressed final yield by 31%, following exposure to 80 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> , when compared with exposure to charcoal-filtered (CF) air. The impacts of both CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on yield were, however, dependent upon the presence or absence of the other gas. In the absence of O<sub>3</sub> , yields were very similar for the ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> treatments, but in the presence of O<sub>3</sub> , yields under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> were greatly suppressed whereas yields under elevated CO<sub>3</sub> were similar to those in the absence of O<sub>3</sub> . Thus, enriched CO<sub>2</sub> ameliorated most of the suppressive effect of O<sub>3</sub> on yield of mature fruit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA-ARS, Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reinert", "ForeName": "Richard A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA-ARS, Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eason", "ForeName": "Gwen", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA-ARS, Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barton", "ForeName": "Jeffory", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Acock BV, Reddy R, Hodges JF, Baker DN, McRinion JM. 1985.
