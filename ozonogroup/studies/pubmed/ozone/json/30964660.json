As these pollutants cause significant environmental problems, removal of NO <sub>x</sub> from exhaust gases is necessary. The present study investigated the influence of metal oxide powders on the removal of NO <sub>x</sub> by oxidation with ozone. The aim of the study was to compare the catalytic effect of TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and to investigate the dependence of the effective rate constant on temperature. NO (400 ppm) and a variable concentration of ozone in a mixture of N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> was directed through the catalyst chamber and heated to 60-140 \u00b0C. The addition of metal oxides resulted in a significant increase in the efficiency of the oxidation of NO to N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> had the largest effect with a maximum of an approximately 3-fold increase in the effective rate constant at 100 \u00b0C. At the same time Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> had the lowest NO <sub>x</sub> adsorption capacity. In the case of all metal oxides, oxidation of NO to N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> caused an abrupt increase in adsorption of NO <sub>x</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physics , University of Tartu , W.
