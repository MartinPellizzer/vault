Treatments that showed good outcomes were Ozone, PRF, PRP/Debridement/Laser bio-stimulation, Laser surgery and Laser surgery/Laser bio-stimulation. HBO did not achieve good results and was used in only 10 patients. BRONJ is a rare condition in patients with osteoporosis/other pathologies using BP orally. These patients had long exposure time and cumulative doses of BPs until onset of the lesion. The oncological patients were exposed to more potent intravenously administered BPs such as pamidronate and zoledronate. These patients had a shorter exposure time until onset of the lesion.", "The treatment of BRONJ is still under debate and there are promising treatments that need randomized trials with larger numbers of patients to confirm their results. Patients receiving BPs or those who will start treatment should be encouraged to perform preventive dental treatment and maintain good oral hygiene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ferreira Jr", "ForeName": "Luiz H", "Initials": "LH", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Mendon\u00e7a Jr", "ForeName": "Kedson D", "Initials": "KD", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nutrition, University of Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro, Uberaba, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Chaves de Souza", "ForeName": "Jessica", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Soares Dos Reis", "ForeName": "Danyella C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil."}], "LastName": "do Carmo Faleiros Veloso Guedes", "ForeName": "Cizelene", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Souza Castro Filice", "ForeName": "Let\u00edcia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Implantology, University of Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bruzadelli Macedo", "ForeName": "S\u00e9rgio", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Implantology, University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil - flavianasoares.rocha@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Soares Rocha", "ForeName": "Flaviana", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Minerva Dent Oral Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101778009", "ISSNLinking": "2724-6329"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diphosphonates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diphosphonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteonecrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32960522", "10.23736/S2724-6329.20.04306-X", "S0026-4970.20.04306-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
