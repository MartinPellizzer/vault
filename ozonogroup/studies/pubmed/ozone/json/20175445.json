These observations were compared with ozone concentrations from three permanent monitoring stations using ultraviolet absorption instruments. Ozone concentrations at Latnjajaure were higher than at the closest monitoring site, illustrating the importance of high elevation for ozone. At the northern sites the ozone spring peak was more pronounced, higher, and earlier (April maximum) compared to a site in south Sweden (May maximum). During summer, ozone concentrations were higher in south Sweden. Presently, the growing season largely starts after the ozone spring peak in north Sweden but is likely to start earlier in the future climate. This could lead to an increased risk for ozone effects on vegetation if the current yearly ozone cycle persists."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Gothenburg, Plant and Environmental Sciences, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. jenny.klingberg@dpes.gu.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klingberg", "ForeName": "Jenny", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bj\u00f6rkman", "ForeName": "Mats P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karlsson", "ForeName": "Gunilla Pihl", "Initials": "GP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pleijel", "ForeName": "H\u00e5kan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Sweden", "MedlineTA": "Ambio", "NlmUniqueID": "0364220", "ISSNLinking": "0044-7447"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sweden"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20175445", "10.1579/0044-7447-38.8.448"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
