One side of the box was exposed to an electric field at various strengths, while a visually identical opposite side was shielded from exposure. In the short-term tests, rats generally remained shielded from electric fields of 90 kV/m and greater during the first session, and maintained this response in subsequent sessions. In the longer test, this same preference response was demonstrated at field strengths of 75 kV/m and greater; however, at 25 and 50 kV/m, rats exhibited a statistically significant preference for the exposed region of the shuttlebox, but only during the light portion of a 12-hour light: 12-hour dark cycle. Exposed animals made more traverses than sham-exposed controls between the two ends of the shuttlebox during the first hour of the test. The experimental data support the hypothesis that the observed behavioral effects are the result of direct interaction of the electric field with the animal, and not the result of secondary factors such as electric shocks, corona discharge, audible noise, ozone, or vibration of the experimental apparatus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hjeresen", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaune", "ForeName": "W T", "Initials": "WT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Decker", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bioelectromagnetics", "NlmUniqueID": "8008281", "ISSNLinking": "0197-8462"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "W980KJ009P", "NameOfSubstance": "Corticosterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Avoidance Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Corticosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electromagnetic Fields"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electromagnetic Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7284027", "10.1002/bem.2250010306"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
