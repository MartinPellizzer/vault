One hundred and ninety water samples of ozone and chlorine treated water were collected at a water treatment plant between August 2004 and March 2005. The level of THMs, total organic carbon and residual chlorine were determined. Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition assay was used to detect microcystins and the presence of microcystins was confirmed by HPLC. The results show that 91.5% of the THM species in treated water was chloroform and 8.5% was bromodichloromethane. The mean THM level+/- standard error of mean in chlorinated water (CW) (45.1+/-3.0 microg/L) was higher than the mean of THM level in ozonated water (OW) (18.6+/-2.2 microg/L). In addition, no OW sample exceeded the first stage U.S. EPA maximum THM contaminant level for drinking water (80 microg/L) and only 8% of these samples exceeded the second stage level (40 microg/L). On the other hand, 3% of CW samples exceeded 80 microg/L and 68% exceeded the 40 microg/L level. The microcystin level in all water samples was below the WHO guideline value (1 microg/L) for drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Toxicology, Department of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thapsingkaew", "ForeName": "Orapin", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruangyuttikarn", "ForeName": "Werawan", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kijjanapanich", "ForeName": "Vilailuck", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Water Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101185420", "ISSNLinking": "1477-8920"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18209290", "10.2166/wh.2008.031"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
