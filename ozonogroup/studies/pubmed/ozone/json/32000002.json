The aim of the study is to evaluate the association between exposure to ambient air pollution during early pregnancy and the incidence of hypospadias.", "We conducted a 1:10 case-control study using the Taiwanese Birth Registry database. Male full-term infants reported to have hypospadias were defined as cases, and controls were randomly selected from male full-term infants without any congenital anomaly. The monthly average of ambient air pollutants, including PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NOx, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> 8-h maximum, from 3 months before conception to 6 months post conception was retrieved from air quality monitoring stations and interpolated to the level of township using the kriging method. Multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the associations.", "A total of 200 hypospadias cases, with 2000 healthy controls sampled, were reported during 2007-2014. The results revealed that PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the first 3 months after conception (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.65, per interquartile range [IQR]\u00a0=\u00a015.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and O<sub>3</sub> exposure during the first month after conception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.40, 95% CI: 1.08-1.82, per IQR\u00a0=\u00a08.0\u00a0ppb) were associated with a higher incidence of hypospadias.", "The results of the study suggest that early gestational exposure to ambient air pollution increases the risk of hypospadias among full-term infants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
