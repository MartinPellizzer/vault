The effect of ozonation on genotoxicity in reclaimed water was investigated. It was found that ozonation decreased the genotoxicy dramatically in three tertiary treatment plants. In the further batch ozonation experiment in laboratory, secondary effluent sample used exhibited the genotoxicity of (41.1 \u00b1 4.1) \u03bcg 4NQO/L. Ozonation with a dose of 10 mg O3/L completely removed the genotoxicity in secondary effluent. However, after ozonation, the dissolved organic carbon value of the sample didn't change much but the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) value dropped sharply. With the help of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ozonation was found to change chemical aliphatic carbon and C-O of the dissolved organic matter, which might be the reason of the significant decreases of SUVA and genotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
