We investigated how O<sub>3</sub> wat modulates the salicylic acid/jasmonic acid/ethylene (SA/JA/ET) signalling network in the host, locally and systemically, to induce resistance to nematode and virus.", "The application as soil drench was effective in reducing the number of galls and egg masses, but did not reduce the incidence and severity of TSWV infection. Conversely, O<sub>3</sub> wat applied by foliar spray decreased TSWV disease incidence and severity (-20%), but was not able to control M. incognita infection. SA-related genes were generally upregulated in both locally treated and systemically reached tissues, showing a positive action of the O<sub>3</sub> wat treatment on SA signalling. Neither O<sub>3</sub> wat application method significantly altered JA-related gene expression in either direction. ET-related genes were differentially regulated by root or leaf treatments, indicating that O<sub>3</sub> wat may have different effects on ET-mediated signalling in different organs. JA/ET/SA related pathways were differentially modulated by O<sub>3</sub> wat in the presence of either RKN or TSWV.", "O<sub>3</sub> wat had a higher efficacy when applied directly to organs challenged by the pathogens, although it was potentially able to stimulate defence responses through the activation of SA signalling. Owing to its safety and effectiveness in controlling nematode and virus infections, O<sub>3</sub> wat can be considered as a possible alternative tool for sustainable disease management practices. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio Agro-Food Sciences, Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, CNR, Bari, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prigigallo", "ForeName": "Maria I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio Agro-Food Sciences, Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, CNR, Bari, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melillo", "ForeName": "Maria Teresa", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio Agro-Food Sciences, Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, CNR, Bari, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bubici", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Hormonal Regulations in Plants, Institute of Experimental Botany, The Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobrev", "ForeName": "Petre I", "Initials": "PI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Hormonal Regulations in Plants, Institute of Experimental Botany, The Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vankova", "ForeName": "Radomira", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio Agro-Food Sciences, Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, CNR, Bari, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cillo", "ForeName": "Fabrizio", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio Agro-Food Sciences, Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, CNR, Bari, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2704-7936"], "LastName": "Veronico", "ForeName": "Pasqua", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Puglia, Italy", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology", "prevention & control", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Immunity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tospovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tylenchoidea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30701652", "10.1002/ps.5362"]}}]}
