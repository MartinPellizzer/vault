The present study is carried out to investigate the haze event observed in IGP in Nov 2017 using ground-based observations, satellite data and synoptic meteorology to understand the possible factors responsible for haze formation. PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcm) concentrations and Air Quality Index (AQI) at two sites (Agra and Delhi) situated in the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (CIGP) showed a sudden increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and deteriorated air quality during 7-14 Nov. To monitor the variation of particulate matter (PM) in IGP, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm) concentrations were monitored at 22 stations in 12 cities of IGP during 1-15 Nov which also showed an increase in PM concentrations during haze event (7-14 Nov). Crop residue burning activities in north-west Indo-Gangetic Plain (NW-IGP) were observed during haze event. Synoptic weather conditions of IGP identified using geopotential height and wind at 700\u00a0hPa showed high-pressure systems and low winds in IGP favoring stagnant conditions during haze event. A detailed analysis of the variation of pollutants and meteorology was carried out at Agra. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) showed higher concentrations during haze event along with lower temperature, low wind speed and high relative humidity. Aerosol ionic composition showed a higher contribution (~84%) of Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to total soluble ions suggesting secondary aerosol formation during haze event."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
