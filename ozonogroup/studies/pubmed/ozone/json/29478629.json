Using ethylenediurea (EDU) as an O<sub>3</sub> protectant, we tested the gas exchange, pigments, antioxidants and biomass of 19 cultivars exposed to 28ppm\u00b7hr AOT40 (accumulated O<sub>3</sub> over an hourly concentration threshold of 40ppb) over the growing season at a field site in China. By comparing the average biomass with and without EDU, we estimated the cultivar-specific sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub> and ranked the cultivars from very tolerant (<10% change) to highly sensitive (>45% change), which helps in choosing the best-suited cultivars for local cultivation. Higher lipid peroxidation and activity of the ascorbate peroxidase enzyme were major responses to O<sub>3</sub> damage, which eventually translated into lower biomass production. The constitutional level of total ascorbate in the leaves was the most important parameter explaining O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity among these cultivars. Surprisingly, the role of stomatal conductance was insignificant. These results will guide future breeding efforts towards more O<sub>3</sub>-tolerant cultivars in China, while strategies for implementing control measures of regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution are being implemented. Overall, these results suggest that present ambient O<sub>3</sub> pollution is a serious concern for soybean in China, which highlights the urgent need for policy-making actions to protect this critical staple food."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
