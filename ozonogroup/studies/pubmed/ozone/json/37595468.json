However, few studies have addressed the effect of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, a subclinical indicator of early damage to the cardiovascular system. This study aimed to examine the association between short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and ECG abnormalities. We included 102,027 visits of 47,290 participants over 40 years old who had a normal ECG at baseline and then visited again at least once from the China National Stroke Screening Survey (CNSSS). Short-term ozone exposure concentrations were measured as averages of maximum daily 8-h O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over the two weeks prior to ECG measurements. The generalized estimation equations models were used to evaluate the association between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and ECG abnormalities. For every 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increment in short-term O<sub>3</sub> concentration, the odds ratio of any ECG abnormality was 1.055 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.045-1.064). For ECG-diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia, the odds ratio was 1.062 (95% CI 1.052-1.072). A nonlinear analysis showed a sublinear relationship between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and risk for ECG abnormalities. The association between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and ECG abnormalities varied by subpopulation. Our study provided new epidemiological evidence on the association between short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure and ECG abnormalities. There is an urgent need to control ambient O<sub>3</sub> pollution to prevent cardiovascular events."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
