The uncertainty of the tracer-based method due to the ozone oxidation of secondary organic tracers was also addressed. The results showed that the effective rate constants of analogue of 2-methyl erythritol (AME) and 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid (DHOPA) were (4.60\u00b10.66)\u00d710<sup>-19</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7(molecule\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>and (6.57\u00b10.51)\u00d710<sup>-19</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7(molecule\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Given the instability of the secondary organic tracers caused by the oxidation, the contributions of toluene and isoprene to secondary organic aerosols could be underestimated by 16.5%-44.8% and 18.3%-47.3%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Prevention and Control, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ya-Juan", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Prevention and Control, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Prevention and Control, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Rong-Shu", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Organic Pollution Prevention and Control, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087962", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201803064"]}}]}
