Among them, ZnO thin-film-based UV sensors have been attracting attention among research groups and are being continuously studied. The incorporation of ZnO/organic hybrid structures into solar cells and other photoelectrochemical applications has been extensively reported. However, little research has been performed on ZnO/polymer-based UV sensors. In this study, a simple UV sensor based on an Al:ZnO/polymer is demonstrated. Al-doped ZnO enables effective UV detection with excellent performance at low operating voltages using a simple and inexpensive process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Gachon University, 1342 SeongnamDaero, Sujeong-Gu, Seongnam-Si, Gyeonggi-Do 13120, Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Seong Gwan", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Gachon University, 1342 SeongnamDaero, Sujeong-Gu, Seongnam-Si, Gyeonggi-Do 13120, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyung Wook", "Initials": "HW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33404450", "10.1166/jnn.2021.18946"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
