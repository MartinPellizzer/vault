Protocol 1: 96 bovine incisors were randomly divided into 4 groups, and enamel surfaces were bonded in accordance with the following treatments: (1E) ozone + Clearfil Protect Bond; (2E) Clearfil Protect Bond (control); (3E) ozone + Xeno III; (4E) Xeno III (control). Ozone gas was applied for 80 s. Shear bond strength was measured with a universal testing machine. Protocol 2: 40 noncarious human molars were selected. Middle/deep dentin was exposed and bonded in accordance with the following treatments: (1D) ozone+Clearfil Protect Bond; (2D) Clearfil Protect Bond (control); (3D) ozone+Xeno III (4D) Xeno III (control). Four-mm-thick buildups were built on the adhesives, then specimens were sectioned in accordance with the nontrimming technique. Specimens were stressed until failure occurred, and failure modes were analyzed. Shear bond and microtensile bond strength data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test.", "No statistical differences were found between ozone treated specimens and controls, neither on enamel nor on dentin irrespective of the tested adhesive. Clearfil Protect Bond showed higher bond strength to enamel than Xeno III, irrespective of the ozone treatment (p < 0.05).", "The use of ozone gas to disinfect the cavity before placing a restoration had no influence on immediate enamel and dentin bond strength."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedicine, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy. m.cadenaro@fmc.units.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cadenaro", "ForeName": "Milena", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delise", "ForeName": "Chiara", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Antoniollo", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Navarra", "ForeName": "Ottavia Chiara", "Initials": "OC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Lenarda", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Breschi", "ForeName": "Lorenzo", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Adhes Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "100888552", "ISSNLinking": "1461-5185"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Clearfil Protect Bond"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Filtek Z250"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xeno III"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Stress Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Shear Strength"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Mechanical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tensile Strength"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19701509", "842793"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
