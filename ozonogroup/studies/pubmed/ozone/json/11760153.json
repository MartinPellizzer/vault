In this study, the availability of circulating neutrophils was manipulated by treatment with either cyclophosphamide or rabbit antiserum against rat neutrophils, prior to exposures to air, a single high ozone exposure of 1 or 2 ppm for 3 h, or a continuous exposure to 0.8-1.0 ppm for up to 48 h. Although cyclophosphamide treatment resulted in undetectable levels of neutrophils in the blood, the recovery of tissue marginated-interstitial neutrophils of 1 x 10(6) cells by collagenase tissue digestion was not significantly diminished at the onset of air and ozone exposures. Cyclophosphamide treatment alone did not cause any permeability damage to air-exposed rat lungs, but did ameliorate ozone-induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil and albumin recoveries after both short-term and 1 d of continuous ozone exposure. In contrast to cyclophosphamide, antiserum treatment resulted in greater than a 90% decrease in neutrophil recoveries from both blood and lung tissue at the onset of air and ozone exposures. Antiserum treatment also abrogated ozone-induced neutrophil accumulations in lung lavageable spaces following both single and continuous ozone exposures, but did not significantly affect ozone-associated lung permeability damage indicated by unaltered BAL fluid albumin recoveries. These data demonstrated that under experimental conditions when neutrophils remain within lung tissue marginated and interstitial pools, reduction in circulating blood neutrophil availability is associated with a concomitant decrease in ozone-induced lung damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA.
