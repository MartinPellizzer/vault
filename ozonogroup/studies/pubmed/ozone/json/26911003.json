The results showed that the double O3-BAC removed 75.9% \u00b1 2.1% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 78.8% \u00b1 2.9% of UV254 and 96.8% \u00b1 0.9% of color at ozone dosage of 200 mg x L(-1). The treated effluent was with COD of below 100 mg x L(-1) and color of below 40 times, meeting the emission requirements of GB 16889-2008. At the same ozone dosage, however, the O3-BAC removed 68.2% \u00b1 1.3% of COD, 69.7% \u00b1 0.5% of UV254 and 92.5% \u00b1 1.1% of color. The treated effluent was with COD of around 150 mg x L(-1) and color of about 60 times, failing to meet the emission requirements. Namely, ozone of 290 mg x L(-1) was required by O3-BAC in order to achieve similar pollutant removals as those in double O3-BAC at O3 dosage of 200 mg x L(-1). In double O3-BAC at ozone dosage of 200 mg x L(-1), total phosphorus was removed by 63.5% \u00b1 4.4%, and the phosphorus concentration in the effluent was remained 1 mg x L(-1) or less, directly meeting the emission requirement of GB 16889-2008."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "An-jing", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Ju-hong", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Song-kai", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Xiao-gang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L\u00fc-jun", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incineration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26911003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
