However, few analyses have focused on resource-limited settings, where much of this burden occurs. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional associations between annual average exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children aged <5\u00a0years living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).", "We combined Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 35 countries with gridded global estimates of annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentrations. We analysed the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and maternal-reported ARI in the two weeks preceding the survey among children aged <5\u00a0years living in 35 LMICs. We used multivariable logistic regression models that adjusted for child, maternal, household and cluster-level factors. We also fitted multi-pollutant models (adjusted for nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>] and surface-level ozone [O<sub>3</sub>]), among other sensitivity analyses. We assessed whether the associations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ARI were modified by sex, age and place of residence.", "The analysis comprised 573,950 children, among whom the prevalence of ARI was 22,506 (3.92%). The mean (\u00b1SD) estimated annual concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> to which children were exposed was 48.2 (\u00b131.0) \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>. The 5th and 95th percentiles of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were 9.8\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> and 110.9\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. A 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with greater odds of having an ARI (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.05-1.07). The association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ARI was robust to adjustment for NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. We observed evidence of effect modification by sex, age and place of residence, suggesting greater effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on ARI in boys, in younger children, and in children living in rural areas.", "Annual average ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, as an indicator for long-term exposure, was associated with greater odds of maternal-reported ARI in children aged <5\u00a0years living in 35 LMICs. Longitudinal studies in LMICs are required to corroborate our cross-sectional findings, to further elucidate the extent to which lowering PM<sub>2.5</sub> may have a role in the global challenge of reducing ARI-related morbidity and mortality in children."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
