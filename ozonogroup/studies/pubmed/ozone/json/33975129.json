Here, we investigate ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in aerosol samples collected along a cross-hemisphere ship cruise between China and Antarctica and on a traverse between coastal East Antarctica and the ice sheet summit (Dome Argus). Perchlorate concentrations range from a few to a few hundred pg m<sup>-3</sup>. A clear latitudinal trend is found, with elevated ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations near populated areas and in the southern mid-high latitudes. Spatial patterns of atmospheric ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> over oceans near the landmasses support that terrestrial ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> is not transported efficiently over long distances. In the southern mid-latitudes, higher ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in March than in November-December may be caused by significant stratospheric inputs in March. Perchlorate concentrations appear to be higher in the warm half than in the cold half of the year in the southern high latitudes, suggesting seasonal difference in main atmospheric sources. ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> may be formed in the reactions between chlorine free radical (Cl\u00b7) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in the stratosphere when Antarctic ozone hole occurs during September-October. And the stratosphere-produced ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> is moved to the boundary layer in several months and may be responsible for the high ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in the warm half of the year. Perchlorate produced by photochemical reactions between O<sub>3</sub> and Cl\u00b7 in the Antarctic stratosphere is likely responsible for the higher ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in Antarctica than in Arctic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
