However, results from studies of the association between acute air pollution exposure and risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are inconsistent for fine particulate matter, and, although pathophysiological evidence indicates a plausible link between OHCA and ozone, none has been reported. Approximately 300 000 persons in the United States experience an OHCA each year, of which >90% die. Understanding the association provides important information to protect public health.", "The association between OHCA and air pollution concentrations hours and days before onset was assessed by using a time-stratified case-crossover design using 11 677 emergency medical service-logged OHCA events between 2004 and 2011 in Houston, Texas. Air pollution concentrations were obtained from an extensive area monitor network. An average increase of 6 \u00b5g/m(3) in fine particulate matter 2 days before onset was associated with an increased risk of OHCA (1.046; 95% confidence interval, 1.012-1.082). A 20-ppb ozone increase for the 8-hour average daily maximum was associated with an increased risk of OHCA on the day of the event (1.039; 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.073). Each 20-ppb increase in ozone in the previous 1 to 3 hours was associated with an increased risk of OHCA (1.044; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-1.085). Relative risk estimates were higher for men, blacks, or those aged >65 years.", "The findings confirm the link between OHCA and fine particulate matter and introduce evidence of a similar link with ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rice University, Department of Statistics, PO Box 1892, MS 138, Houston, TX 77251-1892, USA."}], "LastName": "Ensor", "ForeName": "Katherine B", "Initials": "KB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Raun", "ForeName": "Loren H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Persse", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Circulation", "NlmUniqueID": "0147763", "ISSNLinking": "0009-7322"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23406673", "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.000027", "CIRCULATIONAHA.113.000027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
