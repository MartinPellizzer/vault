MeS2 layers with a polycrystalline structure were synthesized by a chemical deposition method using uniformly spin-coated (NH4)MoS4 and (NH4)WS4 precursor solutions. The ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatment on MeS2 leads to the removal of the surface contaminants produced by the transfer process, resulting in a uniform surface and an increase of the work function. The maximum luminance efficiencies of the OLEDs with UV-O3-treated MoS2 and WS2 were 9.44 and 10.82 cd/A, respectively. The power conversion efficiencies of OPV cells based on UV-O3-treated MoS2 and WS2 were 2.96 and 3.08%, respectively. These values correspond to over 95% of those obtained with (", "PSS) based devices. Furthermore, OLEDs and OPV cells based on MeS2 showed two to six times longer stability in air compared with", "PSS based devices.
