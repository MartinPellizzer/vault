The percentage loss of each NMHC in the polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) bags was less than 5% during a 7-hr storage period; significant NMHCs loss was detected in aluminum foil composite film and fluorinated ethylene propylene bags. The thermal desorption efficiency of NMHCs for adsorption tubes filled Carbopack B and Carboxen1000 sorbents was greater than 95% at 300\u2103, and the loss of NMHCs in the adsorption tubes during 20-days storage at 4\u2103 was less than 8%. The thermal desorption efficiency for C11 NMHCs in the adsorption tube filled with Carbograph 1 and Carbosieve S\u2162 absorbents was less than 40% at 300\u2103, and pyrolysis of the absorbents at 330\u2103 interfered significantly with the measurements of some alkenes. The loss of alkenes was significant when NMHCs were sampled by cryo-enrichment at -90\u2103 in the presence of O<sub>3</sub> for the online NMHC measurements, and negligible for enrichment using adsorption tubes at 25\u2103. Although O<sub>3</sub> scrubbers have been widely used to eliminate the influence of O<sub>3</sub> on NMHC measurements, the loss of NMHCs with carbon numbers greater than 8 was more than 10%. Therefore, PVF bags and adsorption tubes filled Carbopack B and Carboxen1000 sorbents were recommended for the sampling of atmospheric NMHCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
