In this study, the response surface methodology based on the box model simulation was used to quickly and efficiently quantify the O<sub>3</sub> response to their precursors with the optimal experimental design. The results showed that CO had a positive contribution to ozone generation, whereas NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs had a significant nonlinear relationship with O<sub>3</sub>. When the ratio of <i>\u03c6</i>(VOCs) to[<i>\u03c6</i>(NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>)-13.75] was greater than 4.17, the ozone formation regime was NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited and became VOCs-limited when the ratio was less than 4.17. Olefin was the key VOCs' component to affect the formation of O<sub>3</sub>; when the radio of <i>\u03c6</i>(olefin) to[<i>\u03c6</i>(NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>)-15] was less than 1.10 and the value of the <i>\u03c6</i>(olefin) was less than 35\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, olefin went far towards generating O<sub>3</sub>. Response surface methodology demonstrated that it can be well used to explore the influence of multiple factors and their interactions on O<sub>3</sub> formation and provides a new approach for efficient O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change, Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yu-Huan", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Focused Photonics(Hangzhou) Incorporated Company, Hangzhou 310000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change, Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ya-Ru", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change, Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change, Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guang-Yao", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change, Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "She", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change, Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37438266", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202208115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
