After a general discussion of waterborne viral infections, in which it is pointed out that subclinical infections may considerably outnumber clinical cases, the author proposes a method for the concentration and detection of enteric viruses in water by means of membrane filtration and growth on monkey-kidney-cell or other tissue cultures.The various methods of disinfection of water which can reduce the virus concentration to an acceptable level are discussed, and it is concluded that flocculation and filtration followed by chlorination, or ozonation followed by chlorination, are adequate methods where large volumes of water are to be treated. In developing countries where relatively small volumes of water have to be treated, iodination appears to offer certain advantages, allowing the construction of a simple water-treatment plant requiring little supervision. However, until the long-term effects of iodine, in particular on pregnant women and young children, are known iodination plants should be used only on an experimental basis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Bull World Health Organ", "NlmUniqueID": "7507052", "ISSNLinking": "0042-9686"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sanitary Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bull World Health Organ. 1966;35(5):737-49", "ArticleIdList": ["5297808"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Hyg. 1956 May;63(3):250-3", "ArticleIdList": ["13313527"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Hyg Bakteriol. 1953;137(6):440-9", "ArticleIdList": ["13139474"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1947 Apr;37(4):365-72", "ArticleIdList": ["18016503"]}, {"Citation": "Bull World Health Organ. 1968;38(1):79-118", "ArticleIdList": ["5302294"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1961 Aug;51:1118-29", "ArticleIdList": ["13693898"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1942 Nov;32(11):1256-62", "ArticleIdList": ["18015702"]}, {"Citation": "J Virol. 1967 Jun;1(3):472-7", "ArticleIdList": ["4318955"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1958 Oct;48(10):1323-34", "ArticleIdList": ["13583275"]}, {"Citation": "Virology. 1962 Feb;16:122-32", "ArticleIdList": ["14004707"]}, {"Citation": "Can Med Assoc J. 1955 Dec 1;73(11):864-6", "ArticleIdList": ["13270187"]}, {"Citation": "J Am Med Assoc. 1955 Jan 8;157(2):148", "ArticleIdList": ["13211332"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1966 Dec;56(12):2093-105", "ArticleIdList": ["6006102"]}, {"Citation": "Virology. 1958 Feb;5(1):56-67", "ArticleIdList": ["13519749"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1958 Feb;48(2):159-69", "ArticleIdList": ["13521063"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Soc Exp Biol Med. 1956 Aug-Sep;92(4):764-7", "ArticleIdList": ["13370521"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["5302332", "PMC2554483"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
