In this study, applied by theoretical analysis and machine learning method, we examined the effects of atmospheric reactive nitrogen on PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> pollution, in which nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), gaseous nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and particle nitrate (pNO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) conversion process has the co-directional and contra-directional effects on PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Of which, HNO<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> are the co-directional driving factors resulting in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> growing or decreasing simultaneously; while NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and temperature represent the contra-directional factors, which can promote the growth of one pollutant and reduce another one. Our findings suggest that designing the suitable co-controlling strategies for PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> sustainable reduction should target at driving factors by considering the contra-directional and co-directional effects under suitable sensitivity regions. For co-directional driving factors, the design of suitable mitigation strategies will jointly achieve effective reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>; while for contra-directional driving factors, it should be more patient, otherwise, it is possible to reduce one item but increase another one at the same time."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
