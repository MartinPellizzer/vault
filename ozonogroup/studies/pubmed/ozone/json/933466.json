Three levels of exposure (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 p.p.m. of O3) were selected to simulate moderate to severe episodes of oxidant pollution in urban environments. Morphologic evaluation included light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy. Biochemical parameters which were examined included succinate oxidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c reductase activities. The results indicated that (1) exposure to concentrations as low as 0.2 p.p.m. for 7 days induced pulmonary damage; (2) there was a dose-dependent pulmonary response to the three levels of ozone which was quantitated by alterations in biochemical marker enzyme activities and observed morphologically; (3) proportionate differences were not observed in morphologic characteristics of the lesions or detected in biochemical parameters between rats exposed continuously for 7 days and those exposed intermittently for 8 hours a day for 7 consecutive days; (4) alterations in surface height and granularity of the cytoplasmic luminal projection of Clara cells were subtle changes which were dose-dependent, occurring even at the lowest ozone concentration, and best detected by scanning electron microscopy; (5) alveolar macrophage accumulation within proximal alveoli of alveolar ducts was the most readily detectable morphologic indicator of pulmonary damage; and (6) although the brunt of ozone damage was borne by the centriacinar region, there was damage to cilia and increased ciliogenesis occurring in the trachea and larger conducting airways following exposure of 0.5 and 0.8 p.p.m. of ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dungworth", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tarkington", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyler", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lab Invest", "NlmUniqueID": "0376617", "ISSNLinking": "0023-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Air Sacs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["933466"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
