The application to the on-ground calibration of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the Earth Observing System Aura satellite is presented and discussed. With this method and setup, based on an echelle grating, a sampling of the instrument transfer function in the spectral domain can be selected and is not limited by the spectral resolution and sampling of the spectrometer that is being characterized. The importance of accurately knowing the OMI instrument transfer functions in the spectral domain for in-flight differential optical absorption spectroscopy retrievals and wavelength calibration is discussed. The analysis of the OMI measurement data is presented and shows that the instrument transfer functions in the spectral domain as a function of wavelength and viewing angle can be determined with high accuracy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Royal Netherlands Meterological Institute, Bilt, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dirksen", "ForeName": "Ruud", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobber", "ForeName": "Marcel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Voors", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Levelt", "ForeName": "Pieternel", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16761034", "10.1364/ao.45.003972", "90116"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
