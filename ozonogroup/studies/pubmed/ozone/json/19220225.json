The aim of this study was to evaluate the specific impact of ozone (O(3)) on the worsening of childhood asthma, comparing children living at regions with high and low O(3) concentrations (reference site) without the confounding effects of other pollutants.", "Pollutant concentrations were monitored and data concerning asthma prevalence were collected through a questionnaire. The studied population consisted of 478 children aged 6-13 years old enrolled in four schools of the municipalities where monitoring was performed. Remote sites were identified with very low concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds and high concentrations of O(3).", "The prevalence of wheeze for lifetime period and in the past year was 15.9% and 6.3%, respectively. Asthmatic children were identified when dyspnoea and wheezing were simultaneously mentioned in the absence of upper respiratory infections; according to that, the lifetime prevalence of asthmatic symptoms at the remote sites was 7.1%. The comparison with other previous studies was difficult because the criteria for analysis are not conveniently established.", "The prevalence of childhood asthmatic symptoms was about 4% higher at the high O(3) site than at the low O(3) site."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LEPAE, Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica, Faculdade de Engenharia, Universidade do Porto, R.
