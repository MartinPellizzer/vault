Due to the strong interaction between thiols and Ag or Au, self-assembly of alkanethiols onto these metals results in the displacement of \"adventitious material\" from the metal. The cleaning procedure presented here utilized self-assembly of decanethiol on an electrochemically roughened Ag foil for removal of surface contamination. The self-assembled layer was subsequently removed by rapid oxidation with ozone, followed by rinsing in methanol. The clean Ag surface exhibited a tremendously improved background and a 3-fold increase in the enhancement factor for a probe molecule."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Norrod", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rowlen", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21651259", "10.1021/ac980114h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
