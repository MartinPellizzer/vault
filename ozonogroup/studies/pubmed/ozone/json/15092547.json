Merr.) cultivars to O3 stress and to examine the interactions between maturity groups and O3 stress. Cultivars representing Groups III, IV, and V were exposed for approximately 3 months to charcoal-filtered air (CF) and nonfiltered air plus 40 nl litre(-1) O3 (NF + O3). Ozone was added 6 h d(-1), 5 d week(-1) for 13 weeks. The CF effectively reduced the accumulative oxidant exposure (AOX) to less than 1.0 microl litre(-1) h and the NF + O3 treatment approximately doubled the ambient AOX (16.7 microl litre(-1) h) to about 30 microl litre(-1) h. The AOX estimates the total O3 exposure above 30 nl litre(-1) during an entire growing season. Plant growth rates and relative growth rates were reduced by 17.0 and 14.4%, respectively, when averaged over cultivars. Based on growth rates, the Group III cultivars were the most affected by O3 stress. Averaged over cultivars, leaf expansion rates, leaf conductance, and transpiration rates were lower in the NF + O3 treatment compared to the CF control; however, wide variation was found with the stomatal results from field observations. Combined over years and cultivars, grain yield was reduced by an average of 12.5% by O3 stress with 3 of 12 cultivars showing significant reductions. Grain protein content was increased by 0.7% by O3 stress, but cultivar differences were equal to the differences caused by the O3 treatments. Grain oil content was unchanged by the O3 treatments. Group IV cultivars showed the greatest decrease in grain yield due to O3 stress. Multiple regression analyses were calculated using the difference between the CF and NF + O3 treatment as a measure of O3 stress. Significant positive relationships were found among net assimilation rates, plant growth rates, relative growth rates, and leaf expansion rates, which suggest that growth analysis characteristics would be useful in addition to yield in air pollution tolerance improvement studies with soybeans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20784, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulchi", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tuthill", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olinick", "ForeName": "E V", "Initials": "EV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092547", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90031-0", "0269749188900310"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
