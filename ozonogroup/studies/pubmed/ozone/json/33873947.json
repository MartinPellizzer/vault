Karst. exposed to three different concentrations of ozone for three seasons (1985-7) in open-top chambers. The treatments were non-filtered air + ozone (NF +), non-filtered air (NF) and charcoal-filtered air (CF). Ozone was added daily between 11.00-18.00 local time. The study was performed during September and October, 1987. The rate of net photosynthesis was determined using an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) connected to a small cuvette, which was equipped with an artificial light source for unilateral illumination. The measurements were made on shoots of three different age classes: current year, 1 year old and 2 years old. Measurements took place at saturating light intensity (1150 \u03bcmol m<sup>1</sup> s<sup>1</sup> ), at a temperature of 16.6 \u00b10.7\u00b0C, and at a relative humidity of 67.5 \u00b1 5.3%. In current-year shoots the rate of net photosynthesis expressed on a needle-area basis was lowest in the CF treatment and highest in the NF treatment. In 1- and 2-year-old shoots, a decreased rate of the net photosynthetic assimilation rate, expressed on a needle area basis, was observed in trees from the NF and NF+ treatment compared with that of trees from the CF treatment. The effect increased with increasing ozone concentration and shoot age. A significant increase in the rate of respiration, expressed on a dry-weight basis, was observed in current year shoots from trees exposed to NF+. A significant decrease of the leaf conductance to carbon dioxide was obtained in 2-year-old shoots exposed to NF and NF+. A decrease in the content of chlorophyll was observed in 1- and 2-year-old needles from trees exposed to NF+."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, University of G\u00f6teborg, Carl Skottsbergs gata 22, S-413 19 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wallin", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swedish Environmental Research Institute (IVL), Box 47086, S-402 58 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sk\u00e4rby", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, University of G\u00f6teborg, Carl Skottsbergs gata 22, S-413 19 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swedish Environmental Research Institute (IVL), Box 47086, S-402 58 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selld\u00e9n", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Adams, M.
