In this study, we provide a comprehensive of pedestrian flow-environmental pollutants interactions and health risks to residents in first-floor public areas of apartment with high-occupancy. The main findings indicate that under closed management conditions, there is a significant increase in TVOC and noise levels during the peak periods of nighttime pedestrian flow. In the correlation analysis, the significant impact of time granularity selection in clarifying the correlation between pedestrian flow and environmental pollutants has been highlighted, with larger time granularities generally showing stronger correlations, while finer time granularities may help identify specific risks in areas directly connected to the external environment. There is a significant correlation exists between pedestrian flow and environmental pollutants (TVOC, ozone, and noise), with higher concentrations of these pollutants observed during peak pedestrian flow periods, thereby increasing the risk of residents being exposed to adverse environmental conditions. To mitigate the risks associated with TVOC pollution and noise exposure, it is crucial to maintain proper ventilation, avoid conducting cleaning or maintenance activities during peak hours, and implement noise-reducing measures, such as distancing noise sources from residential areas or installing soundproofing barriers. Additionally, the study identifies total volatile organic compounds originating from property maintenance activities and clarifies their dispersion patterns, emphasizing the importance of developing robust, standardized maintenance protocols for indoor environmental quality assurance. This research can improve the environmental sustainability of apartment buildings and provide a theoretical basis for the development of environmental health strategies for high-occupancy public areas of apartment buildings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
