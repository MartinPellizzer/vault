To address these needs, we developed a 3-year average land use regression (LUR) and combined LUR and Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) by incorporating a national area variability LUR model for China from 2015 to 2017 along with data that take into account incompleteness of O<sub>3</sub> monitoring data into a BME framework. Spatio-temporal kriging models that either included or did not include \"soft\" data were used for comparison. The final LUR model included five predictor variables: road length within a 1000\u00a0m buffer, temperature, wind speed, industrial land area within a 3000\u00a0m buffer and altitude. The 1-year predicted O<sub>3</sub> concentrations based on the ratio method moderately agreed with the measured concentration, and the regression R<sup>2</sup> values were 0.53, 0.57 and 0.59 in the year of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The LUR/BME model performed better (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.80, root mean squared error [RMSE]\u00a0=\u00a023.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) than the ordinary spatio-temporal kriging model that either included \"soft\" data (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.57, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a049.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) or did not include the \"soft\" data (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.52, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a058.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). We have demonstrated that a hybrid LUR/BME model can provide accurate predictions of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations with high spatio-temporal resolution at the national scale in mainland China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
