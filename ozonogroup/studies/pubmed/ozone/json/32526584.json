Given abundant emission sources of ozone precursors and the favorable environmental conditions for O<sub>3</sub> formation, this study performed extensive atmospheric chemistry modeling investigations subject to 11 emission control scenarios. These scenarios increased and decreased emission levels of total volatile organic compound (TVOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), the two surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) precursor gases, to examine the relationships between O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> and TVOC. The modeling investigation was carried out for the summer of 2016 in the downtown and petrochemical industrial suburb in the city of Lanzhou. The results revealed that surface O<sub>3</sub> in the downtown area of Lanzhou was controlled by VOCs and in the petrochemical-industrialized western suburb by NO<sub>x</sub>. Higher ozone levels were simulated in the west suburb of the city as compared with the downtown area, agreeing with measured data. The relationships between modeled TVOC/NO<sub>x</sub> ratios and O<sub>3</sub> reductions, as well as the titration effect, were also discussed. The model results provided useful references for the mitigation strategy of ozone reduction in Lanzhou and other major cities in northwest China with similar climate and topography conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
