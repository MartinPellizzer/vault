However, the meteorological factors associated with O<sub>3</sub> pollution remain unclear. Analyzing the characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Suzhou, as a typical urban city, and exploring the high-impact meteorological factors with O<sub>3</sub> pollution are crucial to the prevention and control of air pollution in this region. This study used correlation analysis and machine learning methods to analyze the variation in O<sub>3</sub> concentration and the relationship between meteorological driving factors in Suzhou based on the O<sub>3</sub> concentration data provided by Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Center and the contemporaneous meteorological observation data in Suzhou from April to September in 2015 to 2020. The results showed that: \u2460 O<sub>3</sub> pollution exceeding the standard rate was more than 20% in ozone seasons during the past six years; further, pollution days of O<sub>3</sub> and the number of pollution days of O<sub>3</sub> as the primary pollutant increased yearly. Evidently, the problem of O<sub>3</sub> pollution has become increasingly prominent. \u2461 The diurnal variations in O<sub>3</sub> were unimodal with the valley point at 07:00 and the highest peak between 15:00 and 16:00. Similar trends were found in diurnal variations of both air temperature and solar radiation, but the daily highest peak came earlier than that of O<sub>3</sub>. The results also showed an apparent weekend effect of O<sub>3</sub> concentration in 2017 and 2019 and a significant correlation between O<sub>3</sub> concentration and solar irradiance during the week. In addition, the monthly variation in O<sub>3</sub> concentration and pollution exceeding the standard rate was bimodal. \u2462The occurrence of ozone pollution was affected by various meteorological conditions. The maximum number of days appeared when daily sunshine hours lasted longer than 7 hours, with a daily maximum air temperature around 30\u2103, solar irradiance ranging from 350 to 440 kW\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>, and relative humidity ranging from 50% to 75%, at which time the intensity of pollution was the strongest. When the wind speed of easterly wind was less than 1.5 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, or the wind speed of southwest wind was less than 3.5 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, moderate ozone pollution occurred. \u2463 An optimal prediction model of O<sub>3</sub> concentration was established based on machine learning, which had good predictive ability for O<sub>3</sub> concentration in April, May, July, and September but did not perform well when O<sub>3</sub> concentration exceeded 200 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Meanwhile, it was found that solar radiation had the most obvious effect on O<sub>3</sub> concentration, followed by relative humidity, whereas the temperature and wind were less important than the former two factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Meteorological Bureau of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215131, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Meteorological Bureau of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215131, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Hui-Juan", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Meteorological Bureau of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215131, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Shu-Ya", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Planning and Design, Design School, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou 215131, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jing-Lu", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Meteorological Bureau of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215131, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Center of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215131, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36635798", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202202191"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
