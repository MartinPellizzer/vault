The land Institute near Salina, Kansas is a nonprofit organization devoted to sustainable agriculture. Opinions are provided on the relationship of the Land Institute to sustainable agriculture, the definition of sustainability, the feasibility of replication of his work, his ideas about the destruction wreaked by the plow vs. the sword, technology and population growth, the future farmer, and the speed with which modern science has destroyed the ozone layer. Sustainable agriculture is using the prairie to provide answers to how agriculture can work with nature; the approach will take longer but will sustain both agriculture and people for another 10,000 years. The system runs on sunlight and recycles all materials and is based on the principles of ecosystems, which have been around for hundreds of years. Agricultural technology is based on a fossil fuel intensive infrastructure and is \"parachuted into Third World countries.\" \"Corn - the gift of the gods has been the killer of this continent.\" 50% of the topsoil has been lost, and soil is more important than oil. Advances in biotechnology are seen as the \"human cleverness\" approach; the preference is for an ecological approach first. Biotechnology tells how to \"spin wheels faster,\" but it also generates more waste. The future farmer is more like the 19th century British naturalist. A projection is that 1st the oil is used up, then the natural gas, and when nuclear power is embraced, Murphy's Law must be repealed. It is important to understand the \"we can'ts\". Realization of limits will direct energy to the sun's potential and recycling and the flow of energy. Descartes' notion of correctable ignorance must be repudiated. Our knowledge-based world has led to acid rain, global warming, the ozone hole, and Chernobyl. It took just 25 years for chlorofluorocarbons to destroy the ozone layer. A philosophical shift in thinking must occur. It is easier to build roads than to think ecologically. Accounting must be considered i the ecological spreadsheet of species survival. This achievement would be the Copernican Revolution."]}], "OtherID": ["075692", "00215018"], "PMID": "12317714", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "04", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "30"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0199-0071", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "24", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "ZPG reporter", "ISOAbbreviation": "ZPG Report"}, "ArticleTitle": "Wes Jackson.
