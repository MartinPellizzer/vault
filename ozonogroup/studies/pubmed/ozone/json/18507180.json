It was detected that addition of intravenous OT in a complex of planned therapy of DEP patients at the age about 60 years leaded to more significant and more rapid (vs. control groups) regress of DEP symptoms, in the first place headache, ear noise, sleeplessness, memory reduce. Decrease in objective manifestation of neurological syndromes such as dysmnesic, akineticorigid, asthenic ones. Blood lipid spectrum, blood glucose level, blood coagulant system and cerebral blood flow indices were improved. These effects were more expressive in patients with the age less than 60 years. In control subgroups these changes were less expressed. Thus, of OT in combined treatment of patients with DEP improved efficiency of drug therapy and accelerated regress of various symptoms of this pathology, especially in patients with the age less than 60 years."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Struchkov", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selitski\u012d", "ForeName": "G V", "Initials": "GV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korobe\u012dnikova", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zubkova", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vopr Kurortol Fizioter Lech Fiz Kult", "NlmUniqueID": "2984868R", "ISSNLinking": "0042-8787"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebrovascular Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18507180"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
