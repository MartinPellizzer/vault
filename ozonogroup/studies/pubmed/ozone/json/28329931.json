The health risk levels of air pollution in the 5 cities were calculated and compared with the characteristics of single pollutant concentrationof PM(2.5) or O(3). <b>Results:</b> In the 5 cities, the average concentration of PM(2.5) was highest in Beijing (82 \u03bcg/m(3)) and lowest in Guangzhou (46 \u03bcg/m(3)). And the average concentration of O(3) was highest in Shanghai (72 \u03bcg/m(3)) and lowest in Xi' an (45 \u03bcg/m(3)). In all the cities, the average concentration of PM(2.5) was highest in winter and lowest in summer. In summer, the average concentration of O(3) was lowest. But the health risk level of AQHI showed that the 5 cities had higher frequency of low or medium risk averagely. And Beijing had the highest frequency of high risk in summer (5.69%). Xi' an had the highest frequency of extremely high risk in winter (1.63%). <b>Conclusions:</b> In this study, AQHI could be constructed by using air PM(2.5) and O(3) concentration data which can be obtained in many areas in China. The application of this index is scientific and feasible in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China; National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "W T", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Q H", "Initials": "QH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "X M", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8208604", "ISSNLinking": "0254-6450"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28329931", "10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2017.03.008"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
