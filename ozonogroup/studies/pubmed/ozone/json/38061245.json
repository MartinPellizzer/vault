However, the global evidence on the risk of death from acute kidney injury (AKI) owing to air pollution is limited. Therefore, we investigated the association between short-term exposure to air pollution-particulate matter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)-and AKI-related mortality using a multi-country dataset.", "This study included 41,379 AKI-related deaths in 136 locations in six countries during 1987-2018. A novel case time-series design was applied to each air pollutant during 0-28 lag days to estimate the association between air pollution and AKI-related deaths. Moreover, we calculated AKI deaths attributable to non-compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines.", "The relative risks (95% confidence interval) of AKI-related deaths are 1.052 (1.003, 1.103), 1.022 (0.994, 1.050), and 1.022 (0.982, 1.063) for 5, 10, and 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in lag 0-28\u00a0days of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, warm-season O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The lag-distributed association showed that the risk appeared immediately on the day of exposure to air pollution, gradually decreased, and then increased again reaching the peak approximately 20\u00a0days after exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. We also found that 1.9%, 6.3%, and 5.2% of AKI deaths were attributed to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, warm-season O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations above the WHO guidelines.", "This study provides evidence that public health policies to reduce air pollution may alleviate the burden of death from AKI and suggests the need to investigate the several pathways between air pollution and AKI death."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
