This causes irreversible organ dysfunction and the development of metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Ozonated olive oil shows anti-inflammatory effects when applied directly to the skin; however, there are no reports on its effects on lipid metabolism through its oral administration in rats. Hence, this study investigates the effects of oral ingestion of ozonated olive oil on the pathologies of obese model rats. Obese model Zucker (fa/fa) rats were fed one of the following AIN-76 diets for four weeks: control diet: 6.5% corn oil + 0.5% olive oil, low ozonated oil diet: 6.5% corn oil + 0.45% olive oil + 0.05% ozonated olive oil, high ozonated oil diet: 6.5% corn oil + 0.5% ozonated olive oil. Control diet fed-Zucker lean rats were used as the reference. Growth parameters, hepatic lipids, hepatic enzyme activities, and serum parameters were determined. As the results, there was a dose-dependent improvement of hepatomegaly, fatty liver and elevated levels of hepatic injury markers in Zucker (fa/fa) rat upon ozonated olive oil consumption. Activities of hepatic enzymes related to lipid synthesis and lipid degradation were not affected by ozonated olive oil intake. On the other hand, there was a dose-dependent elimination of hepatic lipid secretion deficiency and suppression of inflammatory factors upon ozonated olive oil consumption. In conclusion, ozonated olive oil intake by Zucker (fa/fa) rats alleviates hepatic steatosis through the inhibition of triglyceride accumulation in the liver and suppression of inflammatory factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tsukishima Foods Industry Co.
