The growth kinetics of silicon oxide films was examined at substrate temperatures ranging from 325 to 514 degrees C. The deposition was governed by a self-limiting surface reaction, and the growth rate at 478 degrees C was saturated at 0.17 nm/cycle for Si(NHC2H5)4 exposures of 2 x 10(6) L (1 L = 10(-6) Torr x s). The films deposited at 365-404 degrees C exhibited a higher deposition rate of 0.20-0.21 nm/cycle. However, they contained impurities, such as carbon and nitrogen, and showed poor film qualities. The concentration of impurities decreased with increasing substrate temperature. It was found that the films deposited in the high-temperature regime (478-514 degrees C) showed excellent physical and electrical properties equivalent to those of LPCVD films."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INAME, Faculty of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul 143-747, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jae-Kyung", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Kwangsun", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jongwan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rha", "ForeName": "Sa-Kyun", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Won-Jun", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22849174", "10.1166/jnn.2012.5623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
