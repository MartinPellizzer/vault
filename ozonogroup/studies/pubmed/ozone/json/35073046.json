When inserting Ti implants into jawbones, the main issue is the lack of strong bonding between the Ti implant and the host bone (osseointegration). Inspired by the outstanding adhesion performance of natural phenolic compounds on metal substrates and promoting effect for cell adhesion, we coated a natural plant extract, <i>Dipterocarpus tuberculatus</i> (MED), on Ti implants. We tested three groups of Ti plates and screw-shaped fixtures: nontreated Ti as commercially produced, ozone-treated Ti as commonly used surface modification for dental implants, and MED-coated Ti. Interestingly, the MED coating on the Ti plate preserved the surface wetting property for 20 days, whereas the hydrophilic wetting of ozone-treated Ti was readily transformed to hydrophobic within a day. Computerized tomography and histopathological analysis revealed that MED coating enhanced new bone tissue formation and regeneration. The gene expression level of integrin as a bone cell adhesion receptor and its downstream key regulators was significantly increased than that of ozone-treated Ti. Therefore, we suggest considering MED-mediated cell signaling pathways in screening natural products for cell adhesion and osseointegration, and MED as a suitable coating agent for improving Ti implantation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program), College of Natural Resources and Life Science/Life and Industry Convergence Research Institute, Pusan National University, Miryang 50463, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jaewon", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program), College of Natural Resources and Life Science/Life and Industry Convergence Research Institute, Pusan National University, Miryang 50463, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yun Ju", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program), College of Natural Resources and Life Science/Life and Industry Convergence Research Institute, Pusan National University, Miryang 50463, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Su Jin", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DENTIS, 6, Yuram-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu 41065, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yu-Sang", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Health, Institute of Traditional Medicine, Vientiane 0103, Lao PDR."}], "LastName": "Douangdeuane", "ForeName": "Bounleuane", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Health, Institute of Traditional Medicine, Vientiane 0103, Lao PDR."}], "LastName": "Souliya", "ForeName": "Onevilay", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program), College of Natural Resources and Life Science/Life and Industry Convergence Research Institute, Pusan National University, Miryang 50463, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Suhui", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program), College of Natural Resources and Life Science/Life and Industry Convergence Research Institute, Pusan National University, Miryang 50463, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sohae", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program), College of Natural Resources and Life Science/Life and Industry Convergence Research Institute, Pusan National University, Miryang 50463, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Dae Youn", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5813-4616"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program), College of Natural Resources and Life Science/Life and Industry Convergence Research Institute, Pusan National University, Miryang 50463, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "Sungbaek", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Biomater Sci Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101654670", "ISSNLinking": "2373-9878"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osseointegration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prostheses and Implants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35073046", "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01220"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
