The defects, facet, and surface area of \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> were cooperatively engineered by an all-in-one acid etching method to enhance the defect accessibility to the reactants. The obtained highly porous \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanorods have rich defects of Mn<sup>3+</sup> (24.9%) and oxygen vacancies (31.4%), mainly active crystal facets of (110), and an ultrahigh surface area of 271.1\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>/g. With \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanorods as the catalysts, more than 90.9% of 4-chlorophenol can be degraded within 12\u00a0min by catalytic ozonation in a wide work pH of 4.5-10.5. The experiments and DFT theory calculations reveal that \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> with (110) facet promotes the adsorption and activation of ozone directly over the defects or indirectly over H<sub>2</sub>O adsorbed on the defects. Thus, more reactive oxygen species (e.g., \u2022OH, \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, surface *O) are generated and get involved in pollutant degradation. This work provides a facile method to maximize the defect accessibility, and a deeper mechanistic study to understand the roles of the defects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
