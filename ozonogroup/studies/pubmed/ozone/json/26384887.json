Two types of ultrasonic reactors viz. ultrasonic horn and ultrasonic bath operating at frequency of 20 kHz and 36 kHz respectively have been used in the work. The effect of initial pH, temperature and power dissipation of the ultrasonic horn on the degradation rate has been investigated. The established optimum parameters of initial pH as 6 (natural pH of the aqueous solution) and temperature as 30 \u00b1 2\u00b0C were then used in the degradation studies using the combined approaches. Kinetic study revealed that degradation of 4C2AP followed first order kinetics for all the treatment approaches investigated in the present work. It has been established that US+UV+O3 combined process was the most promising method giving maximum degradation of 4C2AP in both ultrasonic horn (complete removal) and bath (89.9%) with synergistic index as 1.98 and 1.29 respectively. The cavitational yield of ultrasonic bath was found to be eighteen times higher as compared to ultrasonic horn implying that configurations with higher overall areas of transducers would be better selection for large scale treatment. Overall, the work has clearly demonstrated that combined approaches could synergistically remove the toxic pollutant (4C2AP)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
