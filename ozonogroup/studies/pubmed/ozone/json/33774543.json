Many studies on oxidation processes such as ozone have been conducted to efficiently remove TOrCs in water treatment. However, there has been a lack of research on the removal efficiency of TOrCs in the oxidation process when they co-exist with MPs and form transformation byproducts (TBPs) during this process. This study evaluates the effects of MPs on TOrC removal during ozonation at various ozone concentrations and based on the mass of MP particles in distilled water. The adsorption of TBPs and TOrCs was also evaluated using the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations. The toxicity of these compounds was evaluated to confirm the risk to aquatic ecosystems. The results show that triclosan (TCS) had the highest absorption capacity amongst the TOrCs and TBPs tested. Polyvinylchloride exhibited the highest adsorption efficiency compared with polyethylene and polyethyleneterephthalate (TCS 0.341\u00a0mg/g) due to its high adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity. In the toxicity test, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 4-chloroaniline as TBPs had a relatively higher toxicity to Vibrio fischeri (a marine bacterial species) than Daphnia magna (a freshwater plankton species)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
