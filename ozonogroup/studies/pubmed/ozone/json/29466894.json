The lesional skins were scanned by reflectance confocal microscopy to measure the thickness of epidermis. The skin tissues were stained. Th1-type and Th2-type cytokines in serum and in tissues were detected by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively.", "Ozonated oil significantly inhibited inflammation and healed the lesions in 7\u2009d. Ozonated oil inhibited NGF expression as compared to the groups treated with vehicle or PBS (p\u2009<\u2009.01).The serum proteins and lesional transcripts of Th2 cytokines including IL-4 and IL-31 were lower in the ozonated oil treated group than the groups treated with vehicle or PBS (p\u2009<\u2009.05). The IL-10 level was increased with treatment of ozonated oil (p\u2009<\u2009.01).
