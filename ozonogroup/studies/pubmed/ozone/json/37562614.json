Based on long-term in-situ observations at 35 air quality sites (four categories, i.e., urban, traffic, northern suburban and southern suburban sites) and satellite data, spatiotemporal variability of O<sub>3</sub>, gaseous precursors, and O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<sub>x</sub> sensitivity were explored through multiple metrics during the warm season from 2013 to 2020. Additionally, the contribution of meteorology and emissions to O<sub>3</sub> was separated by a machine-learning-based de-weathered method. The annual averaged MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> increased by 3.7 and 2.9\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>/yr, respectively, with the highest at traffic sites and the lowest in northern suburb, and the rate of O<sub>x</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub>) was 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>/yr with the highest in southern suburb, although NO<sub>2</sub> declined strongly and HCHO decreased slightly. However, the increment of O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>x</sub> in the daytime exhibited decreasing trends to some extent. Additionally, NO<sub>x</sub> abatements weakened O<sub>3</sub> loss through less NO titration, which drove narrowing differences in urban-suburban O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>x</sub>. Due to larger decrease of NO<sub>2</sub> in urban region and HCHO in northern suburb, the extent of VOCs-limited regime fluctuated over Beijing and northern suburb gradually shifted to transition or NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime. Compared with the directly observed trends, the increasing rate of de-weathered O<sub>3</sub> was lower, which was attributed to favorable meteorological conditions for O<sub>3</sub> generation after 2017, especially in June (the most polluted month); whereas the de-weathered O<sub>x</sub> declined except in southern suburb. Overall, clean air actions were effective in reducing the atmospheric oxidation capacity in urban and northern suburban regions, weakening local photochemical production over Beijing and suppressing O<sub>3</sub> deterioration in northern suburb. Strengthening VOCs control and keeping NO<sub>x</sub> abatement, especially in June, will be vital to reverse O<sub>3</sub> increase trend in Beijing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
