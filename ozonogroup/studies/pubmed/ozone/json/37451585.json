The PM<sub>2.5</sub> in most regions in China declined, and the decreasing rate in January was lower than the annual average. However, O<sub>3</sub> concentration showed a steady increasing trend in most regions, and the increasing rate in July was slightly higher than the annual average. In particular, the annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and excess rate showed an increasing trend on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains. Conversely, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations had shown a consistent increasing trend, exceeding the annual average limit of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Surface pressure exhibited positive correlations with PM<sub>2.5</sub> in winter and O<sub>3</sub> in summer across urban agglomerations. Moreover, soil temperature at different depths explained over 30% of the variations in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the Chengdu-Chongqing, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and Lanzhou-Xining urban agglomerations. In winter, relative humidity demonstrated a positive correlation with urban agglomerations in northeast and northwest China, regions characterized by dry climates. During the COVID-19 period, the impacts of meteorological factors and soil temperature on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> differed significantly compared to preceding and subsequent periods. Notably, during the winter of 2020, the Harbin-Changchuan urban agglomeration exhibited a notable transition, as O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations shifted from a strong negative correlation to a robust positive correlation. This remarkable shift, with deviations explained up to 60%, represents a unique phenomenon worth emphasizing in the study's findings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
