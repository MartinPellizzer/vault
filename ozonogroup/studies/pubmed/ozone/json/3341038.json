Rats of both age groups were exposed continuously for 72 hr to either 0.35 or 0.80 ppm ozone, or to filtered air. Tissues were evaluated using light microscopic morphometry and scanning electron microscopy. The lungs from ozone-exposed 60-day-old rats had larger volume fractions of centriacinar lesions than lungs from exposed 444-day-old rats. Within each age group there was an observed dose response, with rats exposed to 0.80 ppm ozone having larger volume fractions of lesions than those exposed to 0.35 ppm. Only the 444-day-old rats lost body weight during the exposure period. They also had smaller fixed lung volumes than same-aged controls. All 60-day-old rats gained weight during the exposure period, although rats exposed to 0.80 ppm ozone gained less than filtered air controls. Lesions observed in both age groups of female rats were qualitatively similar to those previously described in young adult male rats. We conclude that there are age-related differences in the morphometric responses of rats to ozone exposure. Younger rats had larger proportions of centriacinar lesions and macrophages while older rats had greater body weight and lung volume changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stiles", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyler", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-0628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RR-00169", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "pathology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3341038", "10.1016/0041-008x(88)90387-0", "0041-008X(88)90387-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
