These reactions were studied at low pressure at different reagent partial pressures, both with the alkene in excess and ozone in excess. In each case, photoelectron spectra recorded as a function of time have been used to estimate partial pressures of the reagents and products as a function of time using photoionization cross-sections of selected photoelectron bands of the reagents and products, which were measured separately. The yields of all the main products have been determined, some of which have been measured in previous studies. For each reaction, oxygen was observed as a product for the first time and its yield was measured. Kinetics simulations were performed using reaction schemes which were developed for these reactions, which are consistent with that used earlier for the ozone-ethene reaction, in order to determine the main reactions for production of the products. The experimental product yields have been used in a global model to estimate their global annual emissions in the atmosphere. For example, for the reaction of O(3) with 2MP the formaldehyde, formic acid and acetone global annual emissions are calculated as 0.4 Tg, 25.0 Gg and 0.16 Tg respectively, which are estimated as 0.02, 0.3 and 0.2% of the total annual emission respectively. For the reaction of O(3) with DMB, the acetone yield is higher at 0.9 Tg which is approximately 1% of the total annual estimated emission."], "CopyrightInformation": "This journal is \u00a9 the Owner Societies 2011"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Copeland", "ForeName": "Grant", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Mariana V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shallcross", "ForeName": "Dudley E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dyke", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "563-79-1", "NameOfSubstance": "2,3-dimethyl-2-butene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QA2LMR467H", "NameOfSubstance": "isobutylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photoelectron Spectroscopy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21808795", "10.1039/c1cp21922g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
