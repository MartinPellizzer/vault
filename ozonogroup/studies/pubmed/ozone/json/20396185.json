The data analysis showed the importance of fitting a Lorentzian line shape out to several times the halfwidth to obtain a correct value of the broadening coefficient. The measured broadening coefficients of nitric oxide were in good agreement with those obtained by Abels and Shaw. The results of the analysis of eleven lines in the nu(1) band and five lines in the nu(3) band of ozone show a transition-dependent broadening coefficient. The average value of the foreign-gas broadening coefficients for the measured nu(1) and nu(3) lines are 0.075 and 0.073 cm(-1) atm(-1), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Electrical Measurements, S-412 96 Goteborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lundqvist", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margolis", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reid", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20396185", "10.1364/AO.21.003109", "26075"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
