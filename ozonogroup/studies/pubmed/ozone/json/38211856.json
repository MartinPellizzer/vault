The oxidation mechanism of the Fe-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system and the specific degradation and defluorination mechanisms for PFOA and PFOS were determined. Results showed that compared to the single O<sub>3</sub> system, the defluorination rates of PFOA and PFOS increased by 2.32- and 5.92-fold using the Fe-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system under optimal experimental conditions. Mechanistic analysis indicated that in Fe-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the variable valence iron (Fe) and functional groups containing C and O served as important reaction sites during the catalytic process. The co-existence of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, OH, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and high-valence Fe(IV) constituted a synergistic oxidation system consisting of free radicals and non-radicals, promoting the degradation and defluorination of PFOA and PFOS. DFT theoretical calculations and the analysis of intermediate degradation products suggested that the degradation pathways of PFOA and PFOS involved Kolbe decarboxylation, desulfonation, alcoholization and intramolecular cyclization reactions. The degradation and defluorination pathways of PFOA and PFOS consisted of the stepwise removal of -CF<sub>2</sub>-, with PFOS exhibiting a higher defluorination rate than PFOA due to its susceptibility to electrophilic attack. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation systems for PFOA and PFOS treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
