The study involved 90 patients under the age of 55 in the exacerbation phase of lumbar and sacrum dorsopathy with the leading vascular component. The patients were divided into three groups, in which basic medical and physical treatment was given. At the same time, ozone therapy was used the first two groups: the 1st group received standard ozone therapy, with a predominant selection of algic zones, the 2nd - according to the rules of biopuncture, affecting the complex of segmental, distant and \"vascular\" points. In the 3rd control group, the correction was limited to a standard therapeutic complex. The verification of the observed changes was carried out through clinical, psychological and electrophysiological analysis. As a result, both ozone therapy schemes (effective in 69% and 73% of observations respectively) were found to have a reliable advantage over the base complex, where 49% of patients demonstrated improvement. Differences within the ozone therapy groups themselves related to the achievement of a stable effect (in the 2nd group 2.6 days earlier) and the degree of reduction of vaso-reflex reactions (observed in 50% and 75% of observations respectively). Thus, by bringing in additional control methods, it has been proven that the implementation of ozone therapy in compliance with the rules of biopuncture ensures faster and more sustainable effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal State Budgetary Institution \"National medical research center for rehabilitation and balneology\", Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia; Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education I.M.

One of them is the method of local ozone therapy, characterized by anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects as a result of the addition of reflex and specific responses (the action of the gas itself).<sup>,</sup> According to the standard technique the gas mixture is administered intra- or sub-cutaneously to the areas of maximum pain, including the paravertebral lines. In the course of refining the method, we suggested to perform it in accordance with the biopuncture rules, that is, by to impact not only on algic, but also in combination of segmental, distant and \"vascular\" acupuncture points. The hypothesis was based on data of the high efficacy of biopuncture performed in cases of dorsopathies with the help of other agents. in particular, drugs. The efficacy of the new developed option of biopuncture performed with local ozone therapy was previously confirmed by us in practice. Based on new data here reported, our aim is to strengthen the evidence of the applicability of the method."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Agasarov LG.
