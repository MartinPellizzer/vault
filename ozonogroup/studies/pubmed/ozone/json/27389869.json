First, chlorination was tested as a reference disinfection process. Chlorination at a very high dose concentration of Cl2 (75 mg L(-1)) and a long contact time (10 min) were required to achieve approximately 90% ARB and pB10 plasmid transfer removal efficiencies. However, even these stringent conditions only resulted in a 78.8% reduction of pB10 plasmid concentrations. In case of ozonation, the estimated CT (concentration \u00d7 contact time) value (at C0 = 7 mg L(-1)) for achieving 4-log pB10 plasmid removal efficiency was 127.15 mg\u00b7min L(-1), which was 1.04- and 1.25-fold higher than those required for ARB (122.73 mg\u00b7min L(-1)) and a model nonantibiotic resistant bacterial strain, E. coli K-12, (101.4 mg\u00b7min L(-1)), respectively. In preventing pB10 plasmid transfer, ozonation achieved better performance under conditions of higher concentrations of humic acid and lower pH. Our study results demonstrated that the applicability of CT concept in practice, conventionally used for disinfection, might not be appropriate for antibiotic resistance control in the wastewater treatment process. Further studies should be conducted in wastewater engineering on how to implement multiple barriers including disinfection to prevent ARB and ARG discharge into the environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pak", "ForeName": "Gijung", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salcedo", "ForeName": "Dennis Espineli", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water & Environment R&D Team, Research & Development Division, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. , Seoul 110-920, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hansaem", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Junsik", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maeng", "ForeName": "Sung Kyu", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Water Resource Cycle Research, Korea Institute of Science and Technology , Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Kyung Guen", "Initials": "KG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Water Resource Cycle Research, Korea Institute of Science and Technology , Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Seok Won", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun-Chul", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, Columbia University , 500 West 120th Street, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "LastName": "Chandran", "ForeName": "Kartik", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sungpyo", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27389869", "10.1021/acs.est.6b01340"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
