In this work, we determined the kinetics and mechanism of degradation of IPM by a combination of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HSO<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup>), and assessed its effect on the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) during chlorination treatment. The degradation of IPM was accelerated by the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process, and the hydroxyl (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>) and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) radicals were major contributors to the degradation. Using identification of the second order reaction rate between SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> and IPM (k<sub>SO4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup><sub>, IPM</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>), the contribution of HO<sup>\u2022</sup> to the degradation was determined to be 78.3%. The degradation of IPM was facilitated by pH\u00a0>\u00a07, and natural organic matter (NOM) and alkalinity had limited effects on the degradation of IPM in the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process. The transformation products of IPM were determined and inferred by QTOF-MS/MS, and the degradation pathways were elucidated. These include amide hydrolysis, amino oxidation, hydrogen abstraction, deiodination, and hydroxyl radical addition. Interestingly, oxidation of IPM by O<sub>3</sub>/PMS also decreased its potential for formation of I-THMs. After oxidation of IPM, the I-THMs formed from 5-\u03bc\u039c IPM decreased from 14.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> to 3.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> during chlorination. Although the presence of NOM provided the precursor of I-THMs during chlorination of IPM, the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process decreased I-THMs formation by 71%, because oxidation of released iodide into iodate effectively inhibited I-THMs formation. This study provides a new approach for the accelerated degradation of IPM and control of the formation of I-DBPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
