Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has particular importance owing to its global warming potential and stratospheric ozone depletion. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of two rotational grazing strategies characterized by two pre-grazing targets (95% and maximum canopy light interception; LI<sub>95%</sub> and LI<sub>Max</sub>, respectively) on milk production efficiency and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from soil in a tropical dairy farming system based on elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Cameroon). Results indicated that LI<sub>95%</sub> pre-grazing target provided more frequent defoliations than LI<sub>Max</sub>. Water-filled pore space, soil and chamber temperatures were affected by sampling periods (P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>). There was a significant pre-grazing target treatment\u202f\u00d7\u202fsampling period interaction effect on soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration, which was most likely associated with urinary-N discharge. During P<sub>1</sub>, there was a greater urinary-N discharge for LI<sub>95%</sub> than LI<sub>Max</sub> (26.3 vs. 20.9\u202fkg of urinary-N/paddock) caused by higher stocking rate, which resulted in greater N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes for LI<sub>95%</sub>. Inversely, during P<sub>2</sub>, the soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were greater for LI<sub>Max</sub> than LI<sub>95%</sub>. During this period, the greater urinary-N discharge (46.8 vs. 44.8\u202fkg of urinary-N/paddock) was likely associated with longer stocking period for LI<sub>Max</sub> relative to LI<sub>95%,</sub> since both treatments had similar stocking rate. Converting hourly N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes to daily basis and relating to milk production efficiency, LI<sub>95%</sub> was 40% more efficient than LI<sub>Max</sub> (0.34 vs. 0.57\u202fg N-N<sub>2</sub>O/kg milk\u00b7ha). In addition, LI<sub>95%</sub> pre-grazing target decreased urea-N loading per milk production by 34%. Strategic grazing management represented by the LI<sub>95%</sub> pre-grazing target allows for intensification of tropical pasture-based dairy systems, enhanced milk production efficiency and decreased N-N<sub>2</sub>O emission intensity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
