Over 50\u202fbillion\u202ftons of SS are discharged annually in China, and the need for a better waste treatment strategy is urgent. This paper is to introduce a waste disposal technology referring to the integrated treatment of MSW and SS. Four scenarios were analyzed including Mono-incineration of MSW (Case 1) and SS (Case 2), co-incineration of SS and MSW by traditional (Case 3) and integrated ways (Case 4), in terms of environment, energy and economic impact by means of LCA, CED and TEA method. From the environmental perspective, the top four mid-point categories involving the largest effect on four cases are N-C (non-carcinogens), OLD (Ozone layer depletion), TET (Terrestrial eco-toxicity), and GWP (Global warming potential). Case 4 has the most positive effect on climate change and resources (-1.44\u202fkg\u202fCO<sub>2</sub>\u202feq and -18\u202fMJ, respectively) according to end-point categories. From the view of energy, Case 4 shows the best performance of energy efficiency, and significantly saves the non-renewable energy (0.21\u202ft coal per ton feedstock compared with Case 3). From the economic part, Case 4 is preferentially potential with the best profit, cutting down 79.08% of cost in coal than that in Case 3. These results provide understandings of developing an effective approach for co-treating MSW and SS in the near future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
