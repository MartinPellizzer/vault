However, many of the physical and chemical properties of ClONO<sub>2</sub> at the air-water interface or in bulk water are unknown or not understood on a microscopic scale. Here, the solvation and hydrolysis of ClONO<sub>2</sub> at the air-water interface and in bulk water at 300 K were investigated by classical and <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations combined with free energy methods. Our results revealed that ClONO<sub>2</sub> prefers to accumulate at the air-water interface rather than in the bulk phase. Specifically, halogen bonding interactions (ClONO<sub>2</sub>)Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(H<sub>2</sub>O) were found to be the predominant interactions between ClONO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. Moreover, metadynamics-biased AIMD simulations revealed that ClONO<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis is catalyzed at the air-water interface with an activation barrier of only \u223c0.2 kcal/mol; additionally, the difference in free energy between the product and reactant is only \u223c0.1 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, the near-barrierless reaction and the comparable free energies of the reactant and product suggested that the ClONO<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis at the air-water interface is reversible. When the temperature is lowered from 300 to 200 K, the activation barrier for the ClONO<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis at the air-water interface is increased to \u223c5.4 kcal/mol. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of experiments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Zhengyi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Theoretical & Computational Photochemistry of Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University, Beijing100190, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Yeguang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0271-5101"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ziao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5461-1486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania19104, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth & Environmental Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Theoretical & Computational Photochemistry of Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University, Beijing100190, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chongqin", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Entropy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36595549", "10.1021/jacs.2c09837"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
