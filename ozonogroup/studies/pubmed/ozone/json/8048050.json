Epithelial cells lining the airways are the first cells with which inhaled O3 comes into contact and thus represent a potential major target of acute O3 toxicity. In addition, upon appropriate stimulation or injury, these cells are capable of releasing a spectrum of secondary mediators that could relate to the pathogenesis of O3-associated lesions. We exposed organotypically cultured guinea pig primary tracheal epithelial (GPTE) cells in an air/liquid interface to photochemically generated O3 in vitro and monitored effects of O3 exposure on activation of phospholipases A2 (PLA2), C (PLC), and D (PLD), as well as release of the humoral mediator, platelet activating factor (PAF). PLA2 acts on ether-linked phosphatidylcholine, which upon further metabolism forms PAF;PLC acts on inositol phospholipids to produce inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol; and PLD generates phosphatidic acid. GPTE cell cultures exposed to O3 (0.05-1.0 ppm) for 1 hr displayed an elevated total release of PAF (apical+basolateral). Maximal stimulation in both apical and total release of PAF occurred at 1.0 ppm O3 (405 +/- 47 and 282 +/- 23% of air control values, respectively, n = 7). The 1.0 ppm O3-induced increased PAF release was significantly inhibitable by the PLA2 inhibitor mepacrine (1 mM), suggesting a connection between PAF release and PLA2 activation. O3 exposure activated PLC in GPTE cells in a concentration- (0.1-1.0 ppm) and time-dependent (10-60 min) manner to produce a significant accumulation of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate, with maximal accumulation at 1.0 ppm O3 for 1 hr (417 +/- 121% of air control, n = 6). PAF receptor antagonists Ro 24-4736 (1 microM) and Ro 41-5036 (1 microM) did not affect O3-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation. PLD also was activated in GPTE cells exposed to 1.0 ppm O3 for 1 hr (169 +/- 80% of air control, n = 5). These results suggest that GPTE cells respond to O3 exposure in vitro by increasing production and/or release of PAF via a mechanism that may involve activation of PLA2, PLC, and PLD. Epithelial-derived mediators, such as PAF, may play a role in the pathogenesis of lesions associated with inhalation of O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27695."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "D T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adler", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akley", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dailey", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Friedman", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES04951", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL36982", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL37638", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycerophospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inositol Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mucins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Activating Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "phosphatidylethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycerophospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inositol Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mucins"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Activating Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8048050", "10.1006/taap.1994.1135", "S0041-008X(84)71135-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
