The results show that averaged concentrations of VOCs was 27 x 10(-9) before the episode, and then dramatically increased by 3 times (87 x 10(-9)) in the episode than the former, the main components were alkanes (35.2 x 10(-9)), aromatics (30.0 x 10(-9)), alkenes (21.6 x 10(-9)). Furthermore, the maximum ozone formation potential (PhiOFP) is analyzed and showed that PhiOFP (in the episode) > PhiOFP (after the episode) PhiOFP (before the episode). Before the episode, the percent of PhiOFP for aromatics 53.0% , alkenes 36. 1% and alkanes 11.7%; in the episode, the percent of PhiOFP for aromatics 54.7%, alkenes 36.7% and alkanes 9.8%; after the episode, the percent of PhiOFP for alkenes 52.7%, aromatics 36.0% and alkanes 13.2%. Alkenes (C2-C4) and aromatics (C6-C8) are the main components for the ozone formation, namely toluene, m,p-xylene, 1,3-butadiene, propene, ethene et al. In addition, the relationship is negative and nonlinear between the O3 and PhiOFP. And efficiencies of PhiOFP formed into O3 are below 20. 0% in different stage of episode. This is very important and meaningful for the quantitative evaluate the influence of VOCs towards O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200030, China. cuihx@semc.gov.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Hu-Xiong", "Initials": "HX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ya-Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Yu-Sen", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong-Fang", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qing-Yan", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22468514"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
