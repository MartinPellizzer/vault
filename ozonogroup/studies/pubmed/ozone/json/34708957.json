Volatile organic compounds(VOCs) are one of the important precursors of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and secondary organic aerosols. The establishment of VOCs emission inventory is therefore of great significance for controlling the amount of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. To date, the coefficient method has been used, which has error transmission of activity level, parameter and model, leading to the uncertainty of emission inventory. Multivariate uncertainty quantitative analysis of VOCs emission inventory provides an accurate alternative which has not been reported in China. The bottom-up method is adopted to collect the activity level of each enterprise. The variables of pollution control measures are obtained from surveys conducted with enterprises. The VOCs emission inventory of Qingdao from industrial source is established using an optimized coefficient method. The uncertainty of the VOCs inventory on the impact of univariate and multivariate variables is simulated by combining the Monte Carlo method(MC) with Latin hypercube sampling method(LHS). The results show that the total VOCs emissions were 44700 tons from industrial sources in 2019(unoptimized coefficient method:31100 tons).The rubber and plastic industries, metal products, and oil/coal/other fuel processing contributed more VOCs, which accounted for 40.26% of the total emissions. The uncertainty of multivariate simulation is higher than that of single variable. The uncertainty from process(-9.72%-230.51%) and solvent using source(-14.14%-122.77%) is significantly higher than uncertainty from combustion source(-15.62%-36.41%). The main sectors affecting the uncertainty of the VOCs inventory include:the chemical, papermaking, and textile industries(emission factors); metal, automobile manufacturing, and chemical industries(removal rate, facility operating rate); industries of petroleum processing and ferrous metal smelting(too few samples). VOCs emissions are mainly distributed in the east of the West Coast New district, north of Dazhu Mountain, south of Jimo district, north of Chengyang district, northeast of Jiaozhou district, built-up area of Pingdu district, and southeast of Laixi district."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wan-Ying", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Jian-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rui-Peng", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shu-Fen", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qingdao Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monte Carlo Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uncertainty"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34708957", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202103148"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
