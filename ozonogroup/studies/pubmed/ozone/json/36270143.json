Density functional theory calculations result substantiated that molecular ozone could be effectively adsorbed by oxygen vacancies (OV) on the Mn-Co-CM surface and then direct activated into a surface-bound atomic oxygen (*O<sub>ad</sub>) and a peroxide (*O<sub>2, ad</sub>), ultimately producing <sup>\u00b7</sup>OH. Mn-Co-CM coupling with ozone efficiently removed foulants from the permeate and the membrane surface simultaneously and leading to in-situ formation of <sup>\u00b7</sup>OH that changed the nature of the irreversible foulants and ultimately resulted in the rapid release and degradation of humic acid-like substances causing irreversible fouling. However, the commercial CM with ozone mainly removed cake layer fouling including protein-like and fulvic acid-like substances, followed by the slow release and degradation of irreversible foulant, resulting in many humic acid-like substances remain on the membrane surface as irreversible fouling. Based on these, the flux growth rate of Mn-Co-CM was 3.5 times higher than that of CM with ozone. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of in-situ membrane fouling mitigation, when using an efficient catalytic ceramic-membrane. This will facilitate the development of membrane antifouling strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
