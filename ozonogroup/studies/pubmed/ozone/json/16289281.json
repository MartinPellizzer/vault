Dinoflagellate algae, Amphidinium sp. isolated from the Great Barrier Reef, Townsville, Australia were used as indicators since these produce a type of cyst that is difficult to inactivate, but are relatively easy to culture. The ozonation experiments have demonstrated a high ozone demand for inactivation of the algal cultures, which increases as the culture ages. The main ozone demand in seawater is due to its reaction with bromide to form bromine compounds. The non-bromide ozone demand has been estimated by measuring the residuals produced after various doses of ozone. The Amphidinium sp. show an unexpected response to both ozonation and bromination, with an instantaneous inactivation of the organisms for all doses that produced an oxidant residual in the seawater, followed by an effect of the disinfection residual. The standard design procedure of comparing Ct will not be effective for predicting the response of the organism to varying dose, C, and contact time, t, and a plot of ozone produced oxidant residual against organism inactivation for various contact times is proposed for design purposes. High doses of ozone (5-11 mg/L) and up to 6h of residual contact were required for a 4-log inactivation of the Amphidinium sp. Ozonation is likely to be a difficult technology to implement for organisms with this ozone requirement in combination with characteristics of ballast tanks, which contain areas of sediments high in detritus and areas of corrosion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provisor Pty Ltd, P.O.
