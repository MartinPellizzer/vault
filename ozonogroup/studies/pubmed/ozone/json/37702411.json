Here, we explored the potential of SIF to detect the effects of elevated O3 on soybean in the field where soybean was subjected to ambient and elevated O3 throughout the growing season in 2021. Exposure to elevated O3 resulted in a significant decrease in canopy SIF at 760 nm (SIF760), with a larger decrease in the late growing season (36%) compared with the middle growing season (13%). Elevated O3 significantly decreased the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by 8-15% in the middle growing season and by 35% in the late growing stage. SIF760 escape ratio (fesc) was significantly increased under elevated O3 by 5-12% in the late growth stage due to a decrease of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf area index. Fluorescence yield of the canopy was reduced by 5-11% in the late growing season depending on the fesc estimation method, during which leaf maximum carboxylation rate and maximum electron transport were significantly reduced by 29% and 20% under elevated O3. These results demonstrated that SIF could capture the elevated O3 effect on canopy structure and acceleration of senescence in soybean and provide empirical support for using SIF for soybean stress detection and phenotyping."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
