As a result, gamma-alumina can behave distinct activity in enhancing the efficiency of ozonation MIB. Tert-butyl alcohol had a remarkable restrain effect on removal efficiency of catalytic ozonation MIB by gamma-alumina. The surface charge status and surface hydroxyl groups status of gamma-alumina and pH values of the solution can be linked together. When the pH value of solution was near the pH(zpc) of gamma-Al2O3, there was a most observable activity in catalyzed ozonation process. R(ct), which denoted the relative concentration of hydroxyl radical (*OH), was much higher in catalyzed ozonation process than in ozonation process. This result further illuminated that gamma-Al2O3 can promote ozone decomposition to produce *OH. Finally, it was investigated that the effect of r(P/I) on catalyzed ozone decomposition and ozone decomposition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zhonglinchen@hit.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-Lin", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bing-Bing", "Initials": "BB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Ji-Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Miao-Miao", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2371-42-8", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methylisoborneol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17633634"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
