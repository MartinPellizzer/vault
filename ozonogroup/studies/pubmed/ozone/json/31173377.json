Current cleaning techniques are costly and inefficient, calling for the development of alternative remediation methods. In addition, the fate of methamphetamine in indoor environments is largely unknown, negatively impacting our knowledge on the health risks associated with contaminated dwellings. Under the conditions of this study, 97% of surface deposited methamphetamine on a paper substrate was consumed after 12\u00a0min of exposure to ozone, thus demonstrating potential for its use as a remediation agent. The reaction had an effective second-order rate constant with an upper limit of 2.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-18</sup> \u00a0cm<sup>3</sup> /molecule/s, and the main product observed was phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) at 8.3% yield, as determined using GC/MS. Several products observed in this study have also been reported as by-products of methamphetamine synthesis, including P2P-a known methamphetamine precursor, which indicates that their detection at a potential clandestine site is not necessarily evidence of manufacture."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rindelaub", "ForeName": "Joel D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miskelly", "ForeName": "Gordon M", "Initials": "GM"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "University of Auckland through the Faculty of Science Research Development Fund", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "School of Chemical Sciences Performance Based Research Fund", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Forensic Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375370", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Stimulants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "44RAL3456C", "NameOfSubstance": "Methamphetamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Stimulants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Trafficking"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methamphetamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 2007 World Drug Report.
