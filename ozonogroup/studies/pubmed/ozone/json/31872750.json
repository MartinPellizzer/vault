The overarching goal of the study was to evaluate the suitability of these indicators for use as primary traffic exposure metrics in panel-based and small-cohort epidemiological studies.", "Intensive field sampling was conducted on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) between September 2014 and January 2015 at 8 monitoring sites (2 indoors and 6 outdoors) ranging from 5 m to 2.3 km from the busiest and most congested highway artery in Atlanta. In addition, 54 GIT students living in one of two dormitories either near (20 m) or far (1.4 km) from the highway were recruited to conduct personal exposure sampling and weekly biomonitoring. The pollutants measured were selected to provide information about the heterogeneous particulate and gaseous composition of primary traffic emissions, including the traditional traffic-related species (e.g., carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>], nitric oxide [NO], fine particulate matter [PM<sub>2.5</sub>], and black carbon [BC]), and of secondary species (e.g., ozone [O<sub>3</sub>] and sulfate as well as organic carbon [OC], which is both primary and secondary) from traffic and other sources. Along with these pollutants, we also measured two multipollutant traffic indicators: integrated mobile source indicators (IMSIs) and fine particulate matter oxidative potential (FPMOP). IMSIs are derived from elemental carbon (EC), CO, and nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) concentrations, along with the fractions of these species emitted by gasoline and diesel vehicles, to construct integrated estimates of gasoline and diesel vehicle impacts. Our FPMOP indicator was based on an acellular assay involving the depletion of dithiothreitol (DTT), considering both water-soluble and insoluble components (referred to as FPMOP<sup>total-DTT</sup>). In addition, a limited assessment of 18 low-cost sensors was added to the study to supplement the four original aims.", "Pollutant levels measured during the study showed a low impact by this highway hotspot source on its surrounding vicinity. These findings are broadly consistent with results from other studies throughout North America showing decreased relative contributions to urban air pollution from primary traffic emissions. We view these reductions as an indication of a changing near-road environment, facilitated by the effectiveness of mobile source emission controls. Many of the primary pollutant species, including NO, CO, and BC, decreased to near background levels by 20 to 30 m from the highway source. Patterns of correlation among the sites also varied by pollutant and time of day. NO<sub>2</sub> exhibited spatial trends that differed from those of the other single-pollutant primary traffic indicators. We believe this was caused by kinetic limitations in the photochemical chemistry, associated with primary emission reductions, required to convert the NO-dominant primary NO<sub>x</sub>, emitted from automobiles, to NO<sub>2</sub>. This finding provides some indication of limitations in the use of NO<sub>2</sub> as a primary traffic exposure indicator in panel-based health effect studies. Roadside monitoring of NO, CO, and BC tended to be more strongly correlated with sites, both near and far from the road, during morning rush hour periods and often weakly to moderately correlated during other time periods of the day. This pattern was likely associated with diurnal changes in mixing and chemistry and their impact on spatial heterogeneity across the campus. Among our candidate multipollutant primary traffic indicators, we report several key findings related to the use of oxidative potential (OP)-based indicators. Although earlier studies have reported elevated levels of FPMOP in direct exhaust emissions, we found that atmospheric processing further enhanced FPMOP<sup>total-DTT</sup>, likely associated with the oxidation of primary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to quinones and hydroxyquinones and with the oxidization and water solubility of metals. This has important implications in terms both of the utility of FPMOP<sup>total-DTT</sup> as a marker for exhaust emissions and of the importance of atmospheric processing of particulate matter (PM) being tied to potential health outcomes. The results from the personal exposure monitoring also point to the complexity and diversity of the spatiotemporal variability patterns among the study monitoring sites and the importance of accounting for location and spatial mobility when estimating exposures in panel-based and small-cohort studies. This was most clearly demonstrated with the personal BC measurements, where ambient roadside monitoring was shown to be a poor surrogate for exposures to BC. Alternative surrogates, including ambient and indoor BC at the participants' respective dorms, were more strongly associated with personal BC, and knowledge of the participants' mean proximity to the highway was also shown to explain a substantial level of the variability in corresponding personal exposures to both BC and NO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, untargeted metabolomic indicators measured in plasma and saliva, which represent emerging methods for measuring exposure, were used to extract approximately 20,000 and 30,000 features from plasma and saliva, respectively. Using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in the positive ion mode, we identified 221 plasma features that differed significantly between the two dorm cohorts. The bimodal distribution of these features in the HILIC column was highly idiosyncratic; one peak consisted of features with elevated intensities for participants living in the near dorm; the other consisted of features with elevated intensities for participants in the far dorm. Both peaks were characterized by relatively short retention times, indicative of the hydrophobicity of the identified features. The results from the metabolomics analyses provide a strong basis for continuing this work toward specific chemical validation of putative biomarkers of traffic-related pollution. Finally, the study had a supplemental aim of examining the performance of 18 low-cost CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollutant sensors. These were colocated alongside the other study monitors and assessed for their ability to capture temporal trends observed by the reference monitoring instrumentation. Generally, we found the performance of the low-cost gas-phase sensors to be promising after extensive calibration; the uncalibrated measurements alone, however, would likely not have led to reliable results. The low-cost PM sensors we evaluated had poor accuracy, although PM sensor technology is evolving quickly and warrants future attention.", "An immediate implication of the changing near-road environment is that future studies aimed at characterizing hotspots related to mobile sources and their impacts on health will need to consider multiple approaches for characterizing spatial gradients and exposures. Specifically and most directly, the mobile source contributions to ambient concentrations of single-pollutant indicators of traffic exposure are not as distinguishable to the degree that they have been in the past. Collectively, the study suggests that characterizing exposures to traffic-related pollutants, which is already difficult, will become more difficult because of the reduction in traffic-related emissions. Additional multi-tiered approaches should be considered along with traditional measurements, including the use of alternative OP measures beyond those based on DTT assays, metabolomics, low-cost sensors, and air quality modeling."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Health Effects Institute.
