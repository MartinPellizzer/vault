Waters with different types of DOC were used, i.e. a reservoir water for drinking water supply, a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and a solution of humic substances extracted from leaf mold. The multi-stage ozonation-biological treatment process was compared with conventional single-stage ozonation-biological treatment process. Amount of DOC removed in biological treatment was defined as amount of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in influent of biological treatment. DOC removal in the multi-stage ozonation-biological treatment was higher than that in the conventional single-stage ozonation-biological treatment with the same total ozonation time for the reservoir water and humic substances solution. Moreover, three- or four-stage ozonation for 5 min followed by biological treatment (total ozonation time 15 or 20 min) showed higher removal of DOC than the single-stage ozonation (60 min) and biological treatment. The higher DOC removal in the multi-stage treatment was due to the production of BDOC by ozonation. The long-term ozonation was not effective to produce BDOC because most of ozone was utilized to oxidize BDOC produced in the early stage of ozonation. In the multi-stage treatment, ozonation was effective to decompose refractory DOC and to produce BDOC because BDOC was removed by biological treatment. However, multi-stage ozonation-biological treatment was not effective for the secondary effluent. The reason seems to be high concentration of ozone scavengers in that water and low reactivity of DOC for ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishijima", "ForeName": "Wataru", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fahmi"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukaidani", "ForeName": "Tsukasa", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okada", "ForeName": "Mitsumasa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12465796", "10.1016/s0043-1354(02)00257-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
