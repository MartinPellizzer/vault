Alkenes are expected to be a significant component of these films, with the reaction with O<sub>3</sub> being a major sink for O<sub>3</sub> and source of airborne chemicals. Here, we present a sensitive, microscale, nanospectrophotometric method for quantifying the alkene (C=C bond) content of surface films and demonstrate its applicability in five studies relevant to indoor air chemistry. Collection efficiencies determined for a filter wipe method were ~64%, and the overall detection limit for monoalkenes was ~10\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> . On average, painted walls and glass windows sampled across the University of Colorado Boulder campus were coated by ~4\u00a0nm thick films containing ~20% alkenes, and a simple calculation indicates that the lifetime for these alkenes due to reaction with O<sub>3</sub> is ~1\u00a0hour, indicating that the films are highly dynamic. Measurements of alkenes in films of skin oil, pan-fried cooking oils, a terpene-containing cleaner, and on various surfaces in a closed classroom overnight (where carboxyl groups were also measured) provided insight into the effects of chemical and physical processes on film and air composition."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
