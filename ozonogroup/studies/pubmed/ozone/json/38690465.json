This is often done using intracanal irrigants and medications. To accomplish periradicular region sterilization and healing, various intracanal medicaments and irrigation techniques have been researched for better treatment outcomes. Ozonated olive oil is the most researched and successful adjunct to other medicaments owing to its antibacterial properties. Triple antibiotic paste (TAP) (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) was incorporated as an inter-appointment intracanal dressing. Currently, many newer advances are depicting synergistic effects in the elimination of persistent endodontic pathogens. Given this, in the current case series, periapical lesions were managed non-surgically for alternating weeks by the advent of triple antibiotic paste (TAP) and ozonated olive oil (O<sub>3</sub>-oil) with laser activation. Irrigation and its effects were further enhanced with the use of a laser, aiming for thorough debridement and rendering the canal free of microbes. Once the patient was asymptomatic and there was no sinus drainage seen, final obturation was done. Therefore, this case series depicts that traditional root canal therapy with the use of ozonated olive oil and laser activation can non-surgically heal the lesion, leading to successful treatment outcomes. Periapical lesions in three cases have been observed; on the initial visit, all lesions were accessible, cleansed, and shaped. We administered ozonated olive oil with laser activation and a triple antibiotic paste on the following visit. In all three cases, six-month follow-ups have shown evidence of a successful course of therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Kriplani et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Kriplani", "ForeName": "Simran", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Sedani", "ForeName": "Shweta", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Abeer", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Umre", "ForeName": "Utkarsh", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Endodontics-current and future.
