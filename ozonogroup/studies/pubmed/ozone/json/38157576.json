Since little to no information clarifies the dual effects from carbon fiber production to application, this study carried out a life cycle assessment (LCA) to recognize the environmental performances of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fiber production and explore the decarbonization effects of carbon fiber application in wind turbine blades. Based on on-site data from a leading carbon fiber production chain in China, potential environmental impacts of carbon fiber production predominantly originated from the precursor spinning stage (accounted for 13-91%). Fossil depletion (20.24\u00a0kg oil eq.), climate change (67.79\u00a0kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.), terrestrial ecotoxicity (165.63\u00a0kg 1,4-DCB eq.) and photochemical ozone formation (0.14\u00a0kg NO<sub>x</sub> eq.) were the four noteworthy areas to improve the sustainable development. Different scenarios in energy and advanced technology were set to explore the potential improvement of the environmental performance of carbon fiber products. Energy structure (wind power) can improve an average of 22.58% environmental benefit compared with the background scenarios. Regarding the decarbonization effects, the energy payback time and the carbon payback time were estimated to be 0.73 and 0.37 months respectively. Therefore, carbon fiber is a trustworthy material in the strategy to achieve sustainable development from a life cycle perspective."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
