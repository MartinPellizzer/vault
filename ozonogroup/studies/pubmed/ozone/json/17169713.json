Laboratory findings also suggest that low levels of vitamin D metabolites could play a role in the etiology of ovarian cancer.", "The association of solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, stratospheric column ozone, and fertility rates at ages 15 to 19 years with incidence rates of ovarian cancer in 175 countries in 2002 were examined using multiple linear regression in 2006.", "Age-adjusted ovarian cancer incidence rates generally were highest in countries located at higher latitudes (R(2)=0.45, p< or =0.01).
