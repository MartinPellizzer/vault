In order to assess the current public health burden of ambient ozone exposure and to provide information for assessment of potential health benefits of improved air quality, the Health Effects Research Laboratory of the U.S. EPA has undertaken an Ozone Epidemiology Research Program. The research strategy which will guide this scientific program is described in this paper. Criteria for selection of important research questions as well as issues which cut across all questions and study designs are discussed. In particular, this program emphasizes the study of effects which reflect morbidity in the population. The three questions identified as being of most immediate importance involve the relationship of short-term ambient ozone exposure to acute respiratory illness, the relationship of recurrent exposure to chronic respiratory disease, and the relationship of recurrent exposure to development of acute respiratory illness. Specific research approaches and initial projects to address these three questions are described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonnell", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zenick", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Air Waste", "NlmUniqueID": "9433394", "ISSNLinking": "1073-161X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8369110", "10.1080/1073161x.1993.10467176"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
