Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes and play a role in homeostatic mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ozone on human red blood cell CA (hCA) enzyme activity. Blood samples were treated with different doses of ozone (10, 20, 30\u2009\u00b5g/ml) and the erythrocyte total CA activities were determined. Also, purified hCAI and hCAII isozymes were treated with the same doses of ozone and the enzyme activities were measured. About 30\u2009\u00b5g/ml ozone treatment decreased the purified hCAI and hCAII activity and increased the total CA activity compared to the control. Because the implication of CAs on many physiological and biochemical processes is linked to pathologies, it can be suggested that the ozone at a concentration of 30\u2009\u00b5g/ml is safely used by autohaemotherapy in a well-designed clinical trial."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine , Balikesir University , Balikesir , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erken", "ForeName": "G\u00fclten", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine , Balikesir University , Balikesir , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erken", "ForeName": "Haydar Ali", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences , Balikesir University , Balikesir , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bilen", "ForeName": "Cigdem", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences , Balikesir University , Balikesir , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gencer", "ForeName": "Nahit", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Physiol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9510153", "ISSNLinking": "1381-3455"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonic Anhydrase I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonic Anhydrase II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonic Anhydrases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonic Anhydrase I"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonic Anhydrase II"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonic Anhydrases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell-Free System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmolar Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28871825", "10.1080/13813455.2017.1371194"]}}]}
