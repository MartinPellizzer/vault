Here we examine the role of soil reactive nitrogen (N<sub>r</sub>, including NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and nitrous acid (HONO)) emissions in the 2013-2019 ozone increase over the North China Plain (NCP), using GEOS-Chem chemical transport model simulations. We update soil NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions and add soil HONO emissions in GEOS-Chem based on observation-constrained parametrization schemes. The model estimates significant daily maximum 8 h average (MDA8) ozone enhancement from soil N<sub>r</sub> emissions of 8.0 ppbv over the NCP and 5.5 ppbv over China in June-July 2019. We identify a strong competing effect between combustion and soil N<sub>r</sub> sources on ozone production in the NCP region. We find that soil N<sub>r</sub> emissions accelerate the 2013-2019 June-July ozone increase over the NCP by 3.0 ppbv. The increase in soil N<sub>r</sub> ozone contribution, however, is not primarily driven by weather-induced increases in soil N<sub>r</sub> emissions, but by the concurrent decreases in fuel combustion NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions, which enhance ozone production efficiency from soil by pushing ozone production toward a more NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-sensitive regime. Our results reveal an important indirect effect from fuel combustion NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission reduction on ozone trends by increasing ozone production from soil N<sub>r</sub> emissions, highlighting the necessity to consider the interaction between anthropogenic and biogenic sources in ozone mitigation in the North China Plain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
