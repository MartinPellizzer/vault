Although conventional methods such as adsorption and photocatalysis are used for the degradation of TC and OTC, they are inefficient in removal efficiency, energy yield, and toxic byproduct generation. Herein, a falling-film dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor coupled with environmentally friendly oxidants (hydrogen peroxide (HPO), sodium percarbonate (SPC), and HPO\u00a0+\u00a0SPC) was applied, and the treatment efficiency of TC and OTC was investigated. Experimental results showed that moderate addition of the HPO and SPC exhibited a synergistic effect (SF\u00a0>\u00a02), significantly improving the antibiotic removal ratio, total organic removal ratio (TOC), and energy yield by more than 50%, 52%, and 180%, respectively. After 10\u00a0min of DBD treatment, the introduction of 0.2\u00a0mM SPC led to a 100% antibiotic removal ratio and a TOC removal of 53.4% and 61.2% for 200\u00a0mg/L TC and 200\u00a0mg/L OTC, respectively. Also, 1\u00a0mM HPO dosage led to 100% antibiotic removal ratios after 10\u00a0min of DBD treatment and a TOC removal of 62.4% and 71.9% for 200\u00a0mg/L TC and 200\u00a0mg/L OTC, respectively. However, the DBD\u00a0+\u00a0HPO\u00a0+\u00a0SPC treatment method had a detrimental effect on the performance of the DBD reactor. After 10\u00a0min of DBD plasma discharge, the removal ratios for TC and OTC were 80.8% and 84.1%, respectively, when 0.5\u00a0mM HPO + 0.5\u00a0mM SPC was added. Moreover, principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed the differences between the treatment methods. Furthermore, the concentration of oxidant-induced in-situ generated ozone and hydrogen peroxide were quantitatively determined, and their indispensable roles during the degradation process were established via radical scavenger tests. Finally, the synergetic antibiotic degradation mechanisms and pathways were proposed, and the toxicities of the intermediate byproducts were evaluated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
