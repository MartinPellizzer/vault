The organism, which was identified as a Spirillum species, appeared to be specialized in the utilization of a number of carboxylic acids. Yields of 2.9 x 10 CFU/mug of oxalate C and 1.2 x 10 CFU/mug of acetate C were obtained from growth experiments in tap water supplied with various low amounts of either oxalate or acetate. A substrate saturation constant of 0.64 muM oxalate was calculated for strain NOX from the relationship between growth rate and concentration of added oxalate. Maximum colony counts of strain NOX grown in ozonated water (dosages of 2.0 to 3.2 mg of O(3) per liter) were 15 to 20 times larger than the maximum colony counts of strain NOX grown in water before ozonation. Based on the nutritional requirements of strain NOX, it was concluded that carboxylic acids were produced by ozonation. Oxalate concentrations were calculated from the maximum colony counts of strain NOX grown in samples of ozonated water in which a non-oxalate-utilizing strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens had already reached maximum growth. The oxalate concentrations obtained by this procedure ranged from 130 to 220 mug of C/liter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Netherlands Waterworks' Testing and Research Institute, KIWA Ltd., 2280 AB Rijswijk, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van der Kooij", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hijnen", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1977;43(2):187-97", "ArticleIdList": ["596862"]}, {"Citation": "Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1982;48(3):229-43", "ArticleIdList": ["6127053"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1983 Mar;45(3):804-10", "ArticleIdList": ["6847187"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1956 Sep 29;178(4535):703", "ArticleIdList": ["13369512"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1948 Mar;55(3):359-68", "ArticleIdList": ["16561466"]}, {"Citation": "Zentralbl Bakteriol Orig B. 1976 Mar;161(5-6):474-81", "ArticleIdList": ["970023"]}, {"Citation": "J Gen Microbiol. 1965 Nov;41(2):169-74", "ArticleIdList": ["5866126"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1982 Nov;44(5):1086-95", "ArticleIdList": ["6817710"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1953 Jul;66(1):24-6", "ArticleIdList": ["13069461"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1980 Jun;39(6):1198-204", "ArticleIdList": ["16345582"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16346493", "PMC239719", "10.1128/aem.47.3.551-559.1984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
