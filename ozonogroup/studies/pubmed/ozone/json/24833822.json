Cystitis was conducted with transurethral intravesical hydrochloric acid instillation on the subjects in Groups IA, IB, IIA, and IIB. Then, Group IA-IB subjects were transurethrally administered intravesical ozone therapy twice a week, while Group IIA-IIB subjects were only given intravesical isotonic NaCl instillation. Group IIIA-IIIB subjects were administered intravesical isotonic NaCl instillation without conducting chemical cystitis in order to create the same stress. Treatment schemes of all groups were arranged in the same manner. Following a 3-week (early period) and 6-week (late period) therapy, the rabbits were sacrificed and histopathologic investigations were carried out in order to demonstrate changes in the urinary bladder.", "In our study, we observed that the basal membrane and mucosal integrity were maintained, inflammatory cells were suppressed in Group IA-IB (Early and late period), which received ozone therapy. However, it was also observed that mucosal integrity was spoiled, numerous inflammatory cells were accumulated in Group IIA-IIB, which was administered isotonic NaCl.", "Due to its low cost and minimal side effects; ozone therapy could be a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of interstitial cystitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Bayrak", "ForeName": "Omer", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Erturhan", "ForeName": "Sakip", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Seckiner", "ForeName": "Ilker", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Erbagci", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ustun", "ForeName": "Abdulkerim", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karakok", "ForeName": "Metin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Urol Ann", "NlmUniqueID": "101510823", "ISSNLinking": "0974-7796"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abrams P, Cardozo L, Fall M, Griffiths D, Rosier P, Ulmsten U, et al.
