High-precision in situ measurements of 18 halogenated compounds and carbonyl sulfide (COS) made at Gosan, Jeju Island, Korea, from November 2007 to December 2011 were analyzed by a positive matrix factorization (PMF). Seven major industrial sources were identified from the enhanced concentrations of halogenated compounds observed at Gosan and corresponding concentration-based source contributions were also suggested: primary aluminum production explaining 37% of total concentration enhancements, solvent usage of which source apportionment is 25%, fugitive emissions from HCFC/HFC production with 11%, refrigerant replacements (9%), semiconductor/electronics industry (9%), foam blowing agents (6%), and fumigation (3%). Statistical trajectory analysis was applied to specify the potential emission regions for seven sources using back trajectories. Primary aluminum production, solvent usage and fugitive emission sources were mainly contributed by China. Semiconductor/electronics sources were dominantly located in Korea. Refrigerant replacement, fumigation and foam blowing agent sources were spread throughout East Asian countries. The specified potential source regions are consistent with country-based consumptions and emission patterns, verifying the PMF analysis results. The industry-based emission sources of halogenated compounds identified in this study help improve our understanding of the East Asian countries' industrial contributions to halogenated compound emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences/Research Institute of Oceanography, Seoul National University , Seoul 151-742, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shanlan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jooil", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sunyoung", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Seung-Kyu", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Mi-Kyung", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fchle", "ForeName": "Jens", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Gangwoong", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Meehye", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jo", "ForeName": "Chun Ok", "Initials": "CO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kyung-Ryul", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24298975", "10.1021/es402776w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
