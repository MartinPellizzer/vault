Thirty-four campers and counselors had daily pulmonary function tests performed each afternoon while attending camp during the month of July. The subjects ranged from 9 to 35 years of age. A mobile medical screening van was used to house the spirometric equipment and travel to each camp. Continuous ozone measurements were collected over the 19-test day study period. An intense ozone episode was recorded just prior to and during the first 2 weeks of the study. The campers had an increase in respiratory symptoms with increases in ozone concentrations above 120 ppb. Exposures below 120 ppb ozone were not significantly associated with symptoms. Peak expiratory flow rate in children was the only lung function measure associated with increasing ozone concentrations, with an average loss of 4.74 ml/sec/ppb (P-value = 0.05) for the 8-hr ozone exposure measure. Furthermore, it appears that the early intense exposure to ozone produced a persistent decrease in lung function and baseline shift for three days after the episode that obscured the daily dose-response relationship."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Service, New Jersey Department of Health, Trenton 08625-0360."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berry", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lioy", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gelperin", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buckler", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klotz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Camping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New Jersey"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2029875", "10.1016/s0013-9351(05)80096-9", "S0013-9351(05)80096-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
