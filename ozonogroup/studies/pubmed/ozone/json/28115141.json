Using the \"Shunde\" city as a pilot summer case study, we apply an innovative response surface modeling (RSM) methodology based on the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling simulations to identify the O<sub>3</sub> regime and provide dynamic analysis of the precursor contributions to effectively assess the O<sub>3</sub> impacts of volatile organic compound (VOC) control strategy. Our results show that Shunde is a typical VOC-limited urban O<sub>3</sub> polluted city. The \"Jiangmen\" city, as the main upper wind area during July 2014, its VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions make up the largest contribution (9.06%). On the contrary, the contribution from local (Shunde) emission is lowest (6.35%) among the seven neighbor regions. The local VOCs industrial source emission has the largest contribution comparing to other precursor emission sectors in Shunde. The results of dynamic source contribution analysis further show that the local NO<sub>x</sub> control could slightly increase the ground O<sub>3</sub> under low (10.00%) and medium (40.00%) reduction ratios, while it could start to turn positive to decrease ground O<sub>3</sub> under the high NO<sub>x</sub> abatement ratio (75.00%). The real-time assessment of O<sub>3</sub> impacts from VOCs control strategies in Pearl River Delta (PRD) shows that the joint regional VOCs emission control policy will effectively reduce the ground O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Shunde."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016.
