Desili-cated HZSM-5 (DZSM) was fabricated and applied as a Ru-Mn support for the removal of toluene (100 ppm) in the presence of ozone (1000 ppm) at room temperature. The surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of Ru-Mn with a DZSM support (RuMn/DZSM) were measured and compared with those of Ru-Mn/HZSM-5 (RuMn/HZSM). The pore size of RuMn/DZSM (69 \u00c5) was much larger than that of RuMn/HZSM-5 (5.5 \u00c5). In addition, the pore volumes of RuMn/DZSM and RuMn/HZSM were 0.64 and 0.25 cm\u00b3/g, respectively. Furthermore, the ratios of Mn\u00b3+/Mn\u2074+ and O<sub>vacancy</sub>/O<sub>lattice</sub> of RuMn/DZSM were larger than those of RuMn/HZSM-5. The removal efficiency of toluene of RuMn/DZSM was higher than that of RuMn/HZSM due to its larger pore volume, pore size, and the increased ratios of Mn\u00b3+/Mn\u2074+ and O<sub>vacancy</sub>/O<sub>lattice</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Engineering, University of Seoul, Seoul, 02504, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jihee", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Engineering, University of Seoul, Seoul, 02504, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jung Eun", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Engineering, University of Seoul, Seoul, 02504, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "Abid", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Education, Mokpo National University, Mokpo, 58554, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sang Chai", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, 57922, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Sang-Chul", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul 05006, Korea."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "JiHyeon", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, 38453, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Young-Min", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Engineering, University of Seoul, Seoul, 02504, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Young-Kwon", "Initials": "YK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanopores"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33715707", "10.1166/jnn.2021.19194"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
