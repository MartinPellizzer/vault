TFA enters aquatic ecosystems primarily through precipitation and has the potential to accumulate in water bodies with little or no outflow to the point where toxic concentrations could be achieved. This study demonstrated that seasonal wetlands lacking outflow concentrated TFA as they evaporated during the dry season. In addition, the TFA within the pools was retained between years, which may result in long-term TFA accumulation. Since plants acquire TFA from their growing media, the plants exposed to high aqueous concentrations of TFA within the pools had elevated TFA concentrations with a median concentration of 279 ng/g dry weight in their tissues as compared to 33 ng/g for species growing outside the pools. The highest TFA concentrations in water, which occurred just prior to the pools drying up, were in the 2-10 micrograms/L range. These concentrations are approximately 190 or less than reported toxic concentrations for the most sensitive species tested, but our evidence suggests that these concentrations will increase with continued TFA deposition into the pools."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada 89557, USA. thcahill@trentu.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cahill", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwarzbach", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seiber", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E5R8Z4G708", "NameOfSubstance": "Trifluoroacetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trifluoroacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11351522", "10.1021/es0013982"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
