Novel non-thermal technologies such as cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) and natural antimicrobials such as grape seed extract (GSE) are attractive alternatives to conventional food decontamination methods as they can meet the above demands. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial inactivation potential of GSE, CAP (in this case, a remote air plasma with an ozone-dominated RONS output) and their combination against L. monocytogenes on five different 3D in vitro models of varying rheological, structural, and biochemical composition. More specifically, we studied the microbial dynamics, as affected by 1\u00a0% (w/v) GSE, CAP or their combination, in three monophasic Xanthan Gum (XG) based 3D models of relatively low viscosity (1.5\u00a0%, 2.5\u00a0% and 5\u00a0%\u00a0w/v XG) and in a biphasic XG/Whey Protein (WPI) and a triphasic XG/WPI/fat model. A significant microbial inactivation (comparable to liquid broth) was achieved in presence of GSE on the surface of all monophasic models regardless of their viscosity. In contrast, the GSE antimicrobial effect was diminished in the multiphasic systems, resulting to only a slight disturbance of the microbial growth. In contrast, CAP showed better antimicrobial potential on the surface of the complex multiphasic models as compared to the monophasic models. When combined, in a hurdle approach, GSE/CAP showed promising microbial inactivation potential in all our 3D models, but less microbial inactivation in the structurally and biochemically complex multiphasic models, with respect to the monophasic models. The level of inactivation also depended on the duration of the exposure to GSE. Our results contribute towards understanding the antimicrobial efficacy of GSE, CAP and their combination as affected by robustly controlled changes of rheological and structural properties and of the biochemical composition of the environment in which bacteria grow. Therefore, our results contribute to the development of sustainable food safety strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
