However, it is not known whether such changes are accompanied by concomitant responses in plant hydraulic architecture and water relations, which would have great implications for plant growth and survival in face of unfavorable water conditions. A soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cultivar commonly used in Northeast China was exposed to non-filtered air (NF, averaged 24.0\u00a0nl\u2009l<sup>-1</sup> ) and elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (eO<sub>3</sub> , 40\u2009nl\u2009l<sup>-1</sup> supplied with NF air) in six open-top chambers for 50\u2009days. The eO<sub>3</sub> treatment resulted in a significant decrease in whole-plant hydraulic conductance that is mainly attributable to the reduced hydraulic conductance of the root system and the leaflets, while stem and leaf petiole hydraulic conductance showed no significant response to eO<sub>3</sub> . Stomatal conductance of plants grown under eO<sub>3</sub> was lower during mid-morning but significantly higher at midday, which resulted in substantially more negative daily minimum water potentials. Moreover, excised leaves from the eO<sub>3</sub> treated plants showed significantly higher rates of water loss, suggesting a lower ability to withhold water when water supply is impeded. Our results indicate that, besides the direct detrimental effects of eO<sub>3</sub> on photosynthetic carbon assimilation, its influences on hydraulic architecture and water relations may also negatively affect O<sub>3</sub> -sensitive crops by deteriorating the detrimental effects of unfavorable water conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Miao", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ai-Ying", "Initials": "AY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Xiao-Han", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6003-7003"], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Guang-You", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29193125", "10.1111/ppl.12673"]}}]}
