The observed loss of ozone was further analyzed in terms of a numeric model to explicitly track the iodide concentration in the particles. This allowed retrieving a value alpha(b) = 0.6 +/- (0.5)(0.4) for the bulk accommodation coefficient (alpha(b)). The second order rate constant in the bulk phase agreed with available literature (k(b) = (1.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1)) even for the high ionic strength conditions of the present experiments. As long as iodide remained in excess, the average uptake coefficient was gamma = (1.10 +/- 0.20) x 10(-2). Different experiments were performed where the iodide to chloride ratio, the ozone concentration, and the surface to volume ratio of particles were varied. In combination, the results obtained indicate that uptake was driven by fast bulk accommodation and reaction in the bulk for all conditions investigated. The results further suggest that ozone uptake is not limited by the bulk accommodation coefficient alpha(b) under atmospheric conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, 5232 Villigen, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rouvi\u00e8re", "ForeName": "Aur\u00e9lie", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sosedova", "ForeName": "Yulia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ammann", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20553031", "10.1021/jp103257d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
