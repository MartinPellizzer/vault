In the extreme case of step changes between 0 and 90% relative humidity (RH), a large interference in the range of tens to hundreds of ppbv was found for all instruments tested, with the magnitude and sign depending on the manufacturer and model. Considering that water vapor does not absorb at the wavelength of the Hg lamp (253.7 nm) used in these instruments, another explanation is required. Based on experimental evidence and theoretical considerations, we conclude that the water vapor interference is caused by humidity effects on the transmission of uncollimated UV light through the detection cell. The ozone scrubber acts as a water reservoir, either adding or removing water from the air sample, thereby modulating the detector signal and producing a positive or negative offset. It was found for the 2B Technologies ozone monitor that use of a 1-m length of Nafion tubing just prior to the entrance to the detection cell reduces the water vapor interference to negligible levels (+/- 2 ppbv for step changes between 0 and 90% RH) while quantitatively passing ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0215, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "Kevin L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Birks", "ForeName": "John W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17120566", "10.1021/es052590c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
