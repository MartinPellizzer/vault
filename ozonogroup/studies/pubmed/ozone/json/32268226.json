O<sub>3</sub> and OH-induced oxidation of \u03b1-pinene led to the formation of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and secondary organic aerosol particles (SOA), referred to together as oxidation products (OP). Exposure of cabbage plants to O<sub>3</sub> and OH-induced \u03b1-pinene OP led to the deposition and re-emission of gas-phase OP by exposed cabbage plants. In a series of 2-choice bioassays, the specialist cruciferous herbivore, Plutella xylostella adults deposited less eggs on artificial leaves exposed to \u03b1-pinene OP than on control plants exposed to clean filtered air. P.\u00a0xylostella larvae did not show a specific feeding preference when offered leaves from different exposure treatments. However, the generalist Indian stick insect, Carausius morosus, fed more on control filtered air-exposed plants than on those exposed to \u03b1-pinene OP. Taken together, our results show that exposure to \u03b1-pinene oxidation products affects VOC emissions of B.\u00a0oleracea and alters P.\u00a0xylostella oviposition and C.\u00a0morosus feeding responses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
