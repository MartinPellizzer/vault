To investigate the VOC emission characteristics, measurements of VOCs based on proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry during 2017 were conducted in a coastal industrial area in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China. Based on seasonal variation in species concentration, the positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model was applied to apportion the sources of VOCs in each season. The PMF results revealed that unknown acetonitrile source, paint solvent, electronics industry, biomass burning, secondary formation and biogenic emission were mainly attributed to VOC pollution. Biomass burning and secondary formation were the major sources of VOCs and contributed more than 70% of VOC emissions in spring and autumn. Industry-related sources contributed 8.65%-31.2% of the VOCs throughout the year. The unknown acetonitrile source occurred in winter and spring, and contributed 7.6%-43.73% of the VOC emissions in the two seasons. Conditional probability function (CPF) analysis illustrated that the industry sources came from local emission, while biomass burning and biogenic emission mainly came from the northwest direction. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) model showed that secondary formation-related source was mainly from Jiangsu Province, northeastern China and the surrounding ocean. The potential source areas of unknown acetonitrile source were northern Zhejiang Province, southern Jiangsu Province and the northeastern coastal marine environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
