To enhance efficiency in treatment and explore potential valorization, recent developments have introduced novel N<sub>2</sub>O reduction catalysts and pathways. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive and comparative review is absent. In this review, we undertake a thorough evaluation of N<sub>2</sub>O treatment technologies from a holistic perspective. First, we summarize and update the recent progress in thermal decomposition, direct catalytic decomposition (deN<sub>2</sub>O), and selective catalytic reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O. The scope extends to the catalytic activity of emerging catalysts, including nanostructured materials and single-atom catalysts. Furthermore, we present a detailed account of the mechanisms and applications of room-temperature techniques characterized by low energy consumption and sustainable merits, including photocatalytic and electrocatalytic N<sub>2</sub>O reduction. This article also underscores the extensive and effective utilization of N<sub>2</sub>O resources in chemical synthesis scenarios, providing potential avenues for future resource reuse. This review provides an accessible theoretical foundation and a panoramic vision for practical N<sub>2</sub>O emission controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6177-6089"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, China Zhejiang Provincial Engineering Research Center of Industrial Boiler & Furnace Flue Gas Pollution Control, Hangzhou, 310058, China. zbwu@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xuanhao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, China Zhejiang Provincial Engineering Research Center of Industrial Boiler & Furnace Flue Gas Pollution Control, Hangzhou, 310058, China. zbwu@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Jiaxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, China Zhejiang Provincial Engineering Research Center of Industrial Boiler & Furnace Flue Gas Pollution Control, Hangzhou, 310058, China. zbwu@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yanxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8298-993X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, China Zhejiang Provincial Engineering Research Center of Industrial Boiler & Furnace Flue Gas Pollution Control, Hangzhou, 310058, China. zbwu@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Haiqiang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2124-0620"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China. honghe@rcees.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Changbin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4899-6754"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China. zhangrd@mail.buct.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Runduo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8476-8217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China. honghe@rcees.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Surrey, GU2 7XH, Guildford, UK. m.lu@surrey.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Gaoqing Max", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0182-5971"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, China Zhejiang Provincial Engineering Research Center of Industrial Boiler & Furnace Flue Gas Pollution Control, Hangzhou, 310058, China. zbwu@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhongbiao", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Soc Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "0335405", "ISSNLinking": "0306-0012"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39007174", "10.1039/d3cs00919j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
