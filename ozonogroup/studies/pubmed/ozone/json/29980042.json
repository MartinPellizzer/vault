Subjects were exposed for 3\u202fh in random order to 0\u202fppb (filtered air), 70\u202fppb ozone, and 120\u202fppb ozone, alternating 15\u202fmin of moderate exercise with 15\u202fmin of rest. A suite of cardiovascular endpoints was measured the day before, the day of, and up to 22\u202fh after each exposure. Mixed effect linear and logit models evaluated the impact of exposure to ozone on pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes. Site and time were included in the models.", "We found no significant effects of ozone exposure on any of the primary or secondary measures of autonomic function, repolarization, ST segment change, arrhythmia, or vascular function (systolic blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation).", "In this multicenter study of older healthy women and men, there was no convincing evidence for acute effects of 3-h, relatively low-level ozone exposures on cardiovascular function. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of effects with higher ozone concentrations, more prolonged exposure, or in subjects with underlying cardiovascular disease. Further, we cannot exclude the possibility that exposure to ambient ozone and other pollutants in the days before the experimental exposures obscured or blunted cardiovascular biomarker response to the controlled ozone exposures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
