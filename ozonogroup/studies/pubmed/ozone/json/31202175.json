Various parameters including initial solution pH, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> composites dose, O<sub>3</sub> dose and SMX concentration were investigated. Results showed that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> composites could significantly improve the mineralization of SMX by catalytic ozonation system and a synergic effect between Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was observed. Only about 16% total organic carbon (TOC) could be removed in 60\u202fmin by single ozonation under the condition of 20\u202fmg/L SMX, 6.0\u202fmg/min O<sub>3</sub>, pH 5.1 and room temperature, While in the presence of 0.10\u202fg/L Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> composites at the same conditions, 60% TOC removal were obtained by catalytic ozonation process. SMX could be degradation by O<sub>3</sub> rapidly and the removal was not significantly affected by the changing parameters. However, those operating parameters exerted different effects on SMX mineralization. Furthermore, the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and the utilization efficiency of O<sub>3</sub> would increase with the addition of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> composites. The quenching experiments indicated that OH might account for the enhancement of SMX mineralization and the mechanism of catalytic ozonation was proposed. Additionally, the intermediates were detected by using a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), from which some plausible transformation pathways were proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
