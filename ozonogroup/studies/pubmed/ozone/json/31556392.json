At clinical examination, patient reported constant, dull, non-localizable pain at lumbar and sacral level, exacerbated by paravertebral palpation, particularly at L4-L5 and the sacroiliac joint, with a concomitant and remittent neuropathic component, difficult to localize at lumbar and sacral level. The latest magnetic resonance imaging study revealed disc herniations at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 levels. The patient was treated with intramuscularparavertebral injections of oxygen-ozone (O2O3) mixture for 4 weeks (once a week), using a O3 concentration of 20 mcg/mL (5 mL in L4-L5 zone and 5 mL in L5-S1 zone, bilaterally). At 1 week after the first injection, the pain (assessed by Numerical Pain Rating Scale and Brief Pain Inventory) was considerably reduced and the patient's health-related quality of life (assessed by Short Form 12-Item Health Survey and European Quality of Life Index) had improved; these findings were confirmed at follow-up 1 month after the last injection. This paradigmatic case of nociplastic pain successfully treated by paravertebral O2O3 therapy might be a starting point for further studies on the effects of this treatment in terms of decreasing pain and improving HRQoL in patients affected by opioid-resistant LBP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Sire", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baricich", "ForeName": "Alessio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Minetto", "ForeName": "Marco Alessandro", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cisari", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Invernizzi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Funct Neurol", "NlmUniqueID": "8707746", "ISSNLinking": "0393-5264"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Fractures, Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nociception"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Sacrum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31556392", "9091"]}}]}
