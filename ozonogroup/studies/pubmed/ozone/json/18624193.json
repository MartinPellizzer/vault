The experimental results showed that UV itself did not contribute to the removal of HCB obviously and HCB could be quickly degraded by O3 and UV/O3, namely UV < O3 < UV/O3. But in the case of O3 and UV/O3, raising the initial pH value of the system could not raise the removal rate of HCB, and the removal efficiency of 0.2 mg/L HCB could reach 50% within 40 min when the initial pH value was equaled to 3 and the degradation velocity could be accelerated in the acidic solution. Whether in the cases of ozone action alone or UV/O3 combined action, the degradation of HCB satisfied basically the rule of pseudo-first order reaction kinetics; and this rule was more remarkable if a constant pH value of the system was maintained. The degradation pathway and mechanism of HCB were discussed according to the measured results of the intermediated substances from the HCB degradation process by IC, GC and GC-MS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China. waterwdy@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Dong-Yang", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Xiao-Shan", "Initials": "XS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Gui-Ying", "Initials": "GY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Guang-Li", "Initials": "GL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Z87H0LKUY", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexachlorobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hexachlorobenzene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18624193"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
