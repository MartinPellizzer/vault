Unfortunately, the impact of weathering on the aggregation tendency and kinetics of nanoplastics in complex environmental matrices is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the influence of weathering as induced by UV and O<sub>3</sub> treatments, on the aggregation of polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) in simulated waters containing representative organic molecules (humic acid, lysozyme, and alginate) and in natural waters. Results showed that UV/O<sub>3</sub> weathering-induced physicochemical transformations of PSNPs, particularly the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups and the increase in hydrophilicity, altered the aggregation state of PSNPs to different extents. The presence of organic molecules destabilized the UV-aged PSNPs with strength of lysozyme > alginate > humic acid, owing to the decrease of sorption of macromolecules on their surface. Differently, the O<sub>3</sub>-aged PSNPs displayed strong stability in the absence or presence of organic molecules (except for lysozyme), probably due to steric repulsion arising from the leakage of endogenous organic matters. This work demonstrates that the aggregation behavior of PSNPs is determined by the complex interplays among weathering, natural organic matter, and solution chemistry, and provides significant insights into the fate and transport of PSNPs in realistic scenarios."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
