A laboratory set-up was designed and the influence of the structure of the N-compound, the TiO2 and ozone concentration on the formation of breakdown products were examined. The experimental results showed that a considerable increase in the degradation efficiency of the N-compounds is obtained by a combination of photocatalysis and ozonation as compared to either ozonation or photocatalysis only. The mineralization of the model substances was monitored by measurements of the TOC and ion-chromatographic determinations of the formed NO2- and NO3-. The temporal changes of concentrations of breakdown products, such as NH4+, short chain alkyl- and alkanolamines were determined by single column ion chromatography (SCIC) and as well as by electrospray mass spectrometry (EI-MS)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Dortmund, Department of Chemistry, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klare", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waldner", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bauer", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacobs", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Broekaert", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10101856", "10.1016/s0045-6535(98)00414-7", "S0045653598004147"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
