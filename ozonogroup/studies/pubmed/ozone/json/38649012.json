Therefore, we investigated the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and CKD-related mortality in a large multicentre population-based European cohort. Cohort data were linked to local mortality registry data. CKD-death was defined as ICD10 codes N18-N19 or corresponding ICD9 codes. Mean annual exposure at participant's home address was determined with fine spatial resolution exposure models for nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), black carbon (BC), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), particulate matter \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and several elemental constituents of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Cox regression models were adjusted for age, sex, cohort, calendar year of recruitment, smoking status, marital status, employment status and neighbourhood mean income. Over a mean follow-up time of 20.4 years, 313 of 289,564 persons died from CKD. Associations were positive for PM<sub>2.5</sub> (hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.31 (1.03-1.66) per 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, BC (1.26 (1.03-1.53) per 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>- 5</sup>/m), NO<sub>2</sub> (1.13 (0.93-1.38) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and inverse for O<sub>3</sub> (0.71 (0.54-0.93) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). Results were robust to further covariate adjustment. Exclusion of the largest sub-cohort contributing 226 cases, led to null associations. Among the elemental constituents, Cu, Fe, K, Ni, S and Zn, representing different sources including traffic, biomass and oil burning and secondary pollutants, were associated with CKD-related mortality. In conclusion, our results suggest an association between air pollution from different sources and CKD-related mortality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
