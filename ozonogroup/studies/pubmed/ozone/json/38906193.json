In the first, the soil washing is integrated with the bubbling of the oxidant, while in the second, the gas was introduced by a perforated pipe located sub-superficially. Regarding the soil washing treatment, results demonstrate that direct use of ozone is not very efficient, although an important improvement is obtained following activation with hydrogen peroxide or UV light. In contrast, chlorine dioxide exhibited complete methomyl depletion from the soil, although with higher energy consumption and technical complexity compared to ozone. The direct dosing of the gaseous oxidants in perforated pipes is effective, achieving methomyl removals of 7.8 % and 9.2 % using ozone and chlorine dioxide, respectively. In these cases, soil conditions are not significantly modified, which becomes an important advantage of the technology as compared with other electrochemically assisted soil remediation process, in which large regions of the treated soil are affected by important changes in the pH or by depletion of ions. This lower impact makes these novel technologies more promising for further evaluations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..
