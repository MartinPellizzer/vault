The analysis results of 80 effective samples showed that the average concentration of 122 compounds of VOCs was (59.5\u00b119.8)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> during the observation period, and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were the most abundant component. The assessment results of atmospheric reaction activity with ozone formation potential (OFP) showed that the average value of OFP was 145\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> during the observation period, of which alkenes and carbonyl compounds were the most abundant components. The chemical reactivity of VOCs in Hangzhou was equivalent to acrylonitrile. Based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, five major sources of VOCs in Hangzhou were identified, including secondary formation (25.2%), combustion and industrial processing (27.2%), solvent use (17.3%), biogenic sources (9.2%), and vehicular exhaust (21.2%). The results can provide guidance for further understanding of VOC characteristics and the basis for scientific prevention and control measures in Hangzhou."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Sheng-Ao", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Environmental Monitoring Central Station, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Xu-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ya-Qin", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ya-Rong", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Environmental Monitoring Central Station, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jian-Dong", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Li", "Initials": "HL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608879", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201911187"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
