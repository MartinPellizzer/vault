However, little is known about the relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted and regional air pollution. In this study, VOCs emissions from a typical iron and steel plant in Yangtze River Delta (YRD, China) were monitored from April 2018 to March 2019. The ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation of VOCs were calculated to reveal the influence of VOCs emissions on regional ozone and particulate pollution, and the sensitivity analysis approach was performed to explore the qualitative and quantitative relationships between VOCs and O<sub>3</sub>, as well as VOCs and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The VOCs concentration was 93.76\u2009\u00b1\u2009266.97\u00a0ppbv during the study. The OFP was 760.08\u2009\u00b1\u20092391.90\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, and aromatics were the predominant precursors, contributing 54.05% of the total OFP. Furthermore, the SOA estimated by fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC) and time-resolved (TR) methods were 6.032\u2009\u00b1\u200913.347\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> and 0.971\u2009\u00b1\u20094.650\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, accounting for 8.65-26.39% (13.78\u2009\u00b1\u20097.46%) and 1.55-4.20% (2.22\u2009\u00b1\u20091.23%) of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, respectively. The results indicated that VOCs were more sensitive to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in high pollution domains, whereas VOCs were more sensitive to PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in low pollution domains. We concluded that reducing VOCs emissions might be effective in alleviating photochemical pollution episodes in areas around iron and steel industry, and the haze pollution occurred in these regions may be caused by the primary emission of PM, and the contribution of SOA was relatively small."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xufeng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitor Center, 55 Sanjiang Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai, 200235, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitor Center, 55 Sanjiang Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai, 200235, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qingyan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Deming", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiaojia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiqian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China. jpcheng@sjtu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Jinping", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12597-69-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Steel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Steel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32418095", "10.1007/s11356-020-09218-w", "10.1007/s11356-020-09218-w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
