This research proposes that inferences are stronger when nature supports human life specifically. Five studies (N = 1,788) examine evidence for an anthro-teleological bias. People agreed more with design statements framed to aid humans (e.g., \"Trees produce oxygen so that humans can breathe\") than the same statements framed to aid other targets (e.g., \"Trees produce oxygen so that leopards can breathe\"). The bias was greatest when advantages for humans were well-known and salient (e.g., the ozone layer) and decreased when advantages for other targets were made explicit. The bias was not eliminated by highlighting the benefits for other species, however, and emerged spontaneously for novel phenomena (\"Jupiter's gravity protects Earth from asteroids\"). We conclude that anthropocentric biases enhance existing teleological biases to see stronger design in phenomena where it enables human survival.
