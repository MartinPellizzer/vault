The linear and non-linear state space models make accurate short-term predictions of the ozone dynamics. The average prediction error one hour in advance is 7 microg/m(3) and increases logarithmically with time until it reaches 26 microg/m(3) after 30 days. For a given sequence of solar radiation inputs, predictions converge exponentially with a time scale of 8 hours, so that the model is insensitive to perturbations of more than 150 microg/m(3) O(3). The slow increase of the prediction error in addition to the uniqueness of the prediction are encouraging for applications of state space models in forecasting ozone levels when coupled with a model that predicts total radiation. Since a radiation prediction model will be more accurate during cloud-free conditions, in addition to the fact that the state space models perform better during the summer months, state space models are suitable for applications in sunny environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics, Code 692, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vassiliadis", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kourtidis", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poulida", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 1996 Sep;3(3):145-52", "ArticleIdList": ["24235053"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19002621", "10.1007/BF02986367"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
