It has been largely used as an intermediate in the manufacture of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics. Traces of BPA can reach into the environment through inadequate or inefficient removal during wastewater treatment, uncontrolled landfill leachates, and leaching out from the discarded BPA-based materials. Several physicochemical treatment methods including adsorption, Fenton, ozonation, electrochemical and photochemical degradation, and membrane filtration, have been applied for BPA elimination. However, these methods are not adequate for large-scale treatment due to some inherent limitations. Benefiting from high catalytic efficiency and specificity, enzyme-based bio-catalytic degradation strategies are considered quite meaningful alternative for efficient and effective BPA removal from different routes. Among various oxidoreductases, i.e., laccases exhibited a superior potential for the remediation of BPA-containing wastewater. Enzymatic oxidation of BPA can be boosted by using various natural or synthetic redox mediators. Immobilized enzymes can expand their applicability to continuous bioprocessing and facilitates process intensification. Therefore, optimized formulations of insolubilized biocatalysts are of strategic interest in the environmental biotechnology. In this review, recent research studies dealing with BPA removal by the laccase-catalyzed system are presented. At first, the presence of BPA in the ecosystem, sources, exposure, and its impact on the living organisms and human beings is summarized. Then, we highlighted the use of crude as well as immobilized laccases for the degradation of BPA. In addition to toxicity and estrogenicity removal studies, the unresolved challenges, concluding remarks, and possible future direction is proposed in this important research area. It is palpable from the literature reviewed that free as well as immobilized forms of laccases have displayed noteworthy potential for BPA removal from wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
