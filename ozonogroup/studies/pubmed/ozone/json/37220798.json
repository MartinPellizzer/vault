During this period, observation- and emission-based approaches revealed that Zhengzhou was in a VOC-limited regime. The average concentration of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 162.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a071.42\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, dominated by oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs, 34.49%), alkanes (24.29%), and aromatics (19.49%). Six VOC sources were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, including paint solvent usage (25.32%), secondary production (24.11%), industrial production (19.22%), vehicle exhaust (16.18%), biogenic emission (8.87%), and combustion (6.30%). To assess the regional contribution and source apportionment of VOCs and O<sub>3</sub>, Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) with the Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT) was used for simulation. Results showed that the VOCs were significantly affected by local emissions (about 70%), while O<sub>3</sub> was mainly attributed to regional and super-regional transport. Regarding multi-directional regional transport of VOCs and O<sub>3</sub>, dominant contributions were from the northeast and east-northeast directions, and O<sub>3</sub> contributions were also predominantly from the east and east-southeast directions. In terms of source apportionment, the transportation and industrial sectors (including solvent usage) were the major contributors to O<sub>3</sub> and VOCs. To alleviate VOCs and O<sub>3</sub> pollution, transportation and industrial emission reduction should be strengthened, and regional coordination, especially from the northeast to east-southeast directions, should be emphasized in addition to local management."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
