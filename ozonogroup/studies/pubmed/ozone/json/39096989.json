However, due to the limited monitored areas, existing studies were limited in assessing the nationwide risk and suggesting specific vulnerable populations to the ozone-mortality risk.", "We performed a nationwide time-stratified case-crossover study to evaluate the association between short-term ozone and cause-specific mortality in South Korea (2015- 2019). A machine learning-ensemble prediction model (a test R<sup>2</sup>>0.96) was used to assess the short-term ozone exposure. Stratification analysis was conducted to examine the high-risk populations, and the excess mortality due to non-compliance with the WHO guideline was also assessed.", "For all-cause mortality (1,343,077 cases), the risk associated with ozone (lag0- 1) was weakly identified (odd ratio: 1.005 with 95% CI: 0.997-1.014), and the risk was prominent in mortality with circulatory system diseases. In addition, based on the point estimates, the ozone-mortality risk was higher in people aged less than 65y, and this pattern was also observed in circulatory system disease deaths and urban areas.", "This study provides national estimates of mortality risks associated with short-term ozone. Results showed that the benefits of stricter air quality standards could be greater in vulnerable populations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
