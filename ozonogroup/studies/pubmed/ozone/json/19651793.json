However, nothing is known about its potential effects against other environmental sources of oxidative stress such as ozone (O3) in skin. Intake of oral beta-carotene supplements before exposure to sunlight (and thus inevitably also to (O3) has been recommended on a population-wide basis. However, although some studies have shown beta-carotene as providing skin protection as an antioxidant, other studies using skin cells in culture have shown that beta-carotene may have unexpected prooxidant properties (Oberm\u00fcller-Jevic, et al., 2001). Given this, there is an ongoing debate regarding the protective or potentially harmful role(s) of beta-carotene in human skin. In this study, the effect of beta-carotene on ozone's effects on the skin of hairless mice was assessed. After feeding a diet supplemented with 0.5% beta-carotene for 1 month, mice were subjected to O3 exposure (0.8 ppm 6 h/day; 7 days) and the induction of proinflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and markers of oxidative stress, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), were quantitated. The data showed that beta-carotene downregulated the induction of TNFalpha, MIP2, iNOS, and HO-1 in response to O3. We conclude that beta-carotene provides protection against O3-induced skin oxidative stress in vivo, which is consistent with a protective role for beta-carotene in the skin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Siena, via Aldo Moro, Siena, Italy. valacchi8@unisi.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pecorelli", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mencarelli", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maioli", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8602702", "ISSNLinking": "0748-2337"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokine CXCL2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cxcl2 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Chemokine CXCL2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Hairless"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19651793", "10.1177/0748233709103030", "25/4-5/241"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
