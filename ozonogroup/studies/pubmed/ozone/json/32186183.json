However, the inherent difficulties in their measurement, particularly regarding the so-called \"short-lived\" ROS, have limited our understanding of their persistence and concentrations in the atmosphere. This paper aims to address this limitation through the analysis of PM-bound ROS measurements from the Particle Into Nitroxide Quencher (PINQ) system at an atmospheric monitoring site in the city of Heshan, Guangdong Province, China. The measured daily average and standard deviation for the measurement period was 0.050 \u00b1 0.017 nmol\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The averaged measured concentration of ROS per mass of PM and standard deviation was 0.0012 \u00b1 nmol\u00b7mg. The dataset was also correlated with standard pollutants, and a simplified model was constructed to separate the contributions of short-lived (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 5 min) and long-lived (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> \u223c infinity) ROS to total concentration using ozone, carbon monoxide, and PM mass. This showed that the short-lived ROS contribute an average of 33% of the daily PM-bound ROS burden over the measurement period, up to 52% of daily average on elevated days, and up to 71% for hourly averages. These results highlight the need for accurate measurements of short-lived ROS and provide the starting point for a general model to predict PM-bound ROS concentrations using widely available standard pollutants for future epidemiological research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ILAQH (International Laboratory of Air Quality and Health), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), 2 George Street, Brisbane 4000 QLD, Australia."}], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Reece A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ILAQH (International Laboratory of Air Quality and Health), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), 2 George Street, Brisbane 4000 QLD, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Deakin University, Geelong 3216 VIC, Australia."}], "LastName": "Stevanovic", "ForeName": "Svetlana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0436-2044"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), 2 George Street, Brisbane 4000 QLD, Australia."}], "LastName": "Bottle", "ForeName": "Steven", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JNU-QUT Joint Laboratory for Air Quality Science and Management, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Ziyuan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ILAQH (International Laboratory of Air Quality and Health), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), 2 George Street, Brisbane 4000 QLD, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JNU-QUT Joint Laboratory for Air Quality Science and Management, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Changda", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JNU-QUT Joint Laboratory for Air Quality Science and Management, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Boguang", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6066-6638"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ILAQH (International Laboratory of Air Quality and Health), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), 2 George Street, Brisbane 4000 QLD, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), 2 George Street, Brisbane 4000 QLD, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JNU-QUT Joint Laboratory for Air Quality Science and Management, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Ristovski", "ForeName": "Zoran", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32186183", "10.1021/acs.est.9b06643"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
