This study predicted the impact of surface O<sub>3</sub> on cash crop yields, specifically in wheat, potatoes, and tomatoes, under 2 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C climate warming scenarios in Taiwan via high-resolution simulations. The simulated O<sub>3</sub> concentration (daytime mean) over Taiwan's croplands during the growing seasons was around 35-52 ppb, and it increased by 0.9 and 2.1 ppb under 2 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C warming for wheat and potatoes. In contrast, more minor changes of around 0.4 ppb were found for tomatoes. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were converted to AOT<sub>40</sub> (Accumulated Ozone exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb) and POD<sub>3</sub> (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a threshold of 3 nmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>) metrics to estimate changes in relative yield (RY). The mean RY<sub>POD3</sub> (RY<sub>AOT40</sub>) reductions over irrigated cropland for wheat, tomatoes, and potatoes under current climate and O<sub>3</sub>-stress conditions are 27.5 % (19.1 %), 14.7 % (3.8 %), and 8.2 % (1.6 %), respectively. Under 2 \u00b0C warming, the additional reductions would be 2.7 % (1.8 %) for wheat, 4.1 % (0.3 %) for tomatoes, and 2.4 % (0.4 %) for potatoes; the values under 4 \u00b0C warming become 4.7 % (4.1 %) for wheat, 8.1 % (0.6 %) for tomatoes, and 5.2 % (0.8 %) for potatoes. The contribution of RY<sub>POD3</sub> reduction was separated into O<sub>3</sub>-induced and climate-induced effects. The former dominated the additional yield reduction under a 2 \u00b0C warming climate, yet, the latter prevailed under 4 \u00b0C warming. Further analysis indicated that the temperature rise enhances ozone uptake flux; still, the amplified water vapor deficit and more incoming solar radiation can offset it and weakens the overall meteorological effect, especially from 2 \u00b0C to 4 \u00b0C warming conditions. Such effects demonstrated a nonlinear effect related to the co-dependence of the ozone uptake flux, which requires attention in agriculture policymaking."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
