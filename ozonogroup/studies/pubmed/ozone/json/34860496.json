Here, our study on using the ozone-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique at a low temperature of 200 \u00b0C for making an ultrathin, transparent, flexible, and highly electroconducting nanohybrid of indium and aluminum oxides is introduced. Through various characterizations, measurements, and density functional theory-based calculations, excellent electrical conductivity (\u223c950 S cm<sup>-1</sup>), transparency (95% in the visible region), and flexibility (bendable angle of 130\u00b0 for 10\u202f000 cycles) of our nanohybrid oxide thin film with a total layer thickness below 15 nm (2-4 nm for alumina and 10 nm for indium oxide) have been revealed and discussed. Besides, potential sensing applications of our oxide films on a flexible substrate have been demonstrated, such as strain sensors, temperature sensors (25-100 \u00b0C, resolution of 0.1 \u00b0C), and NO<sub>2</sub> gas sensors (0.35-3.5 ppm, optimum operation at 65-75 \u00b0C). With the great potential in not only transparent conducting oxide but also sensing applications, our multifunctional nanohybrid prepared using a simple ozone-assisted ALD route opens more room for the applicability of transparent and flexible electronics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Duy", "ForeName": "Le Thai", "Initials": "LT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7161-6940"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Hyunwoo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Hee-Cheol", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Seunggik", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Ranveer", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9485-6405"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "Hyungtak", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34860496", "10.1021/acsami.1c18623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
