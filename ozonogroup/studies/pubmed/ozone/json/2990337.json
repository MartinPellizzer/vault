Samples were obtained at each level of treatment: raw water, postchlorination, postsedimentation, postfiltration, postozonation, and finished (tap) water. Raw water quality was usually poor, with total coliform counts exceeding 105 to 106 CFU/liter and the average virus count in raw water of 3.3 most probable number of cytopathogenic units (MPNCU)/liter; several samples contained more than 100 MPNCU/liter. All plants distributed finished water that was essentially free of indicator bacteria as judged by analysis of 1 liter for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total plate counts at 20 and 35 degrees C were also evaluated as a measure of the total microbial population and were usually very low. Viruses were detected in 7% (11 of 155) of the finished water samples (1,000 liters) at an average density of 0.0006 MPNCU/liter the highest virus density measured being 0.2 MPNCU/liter. The average cumulative virus reduction was 95.15% after sedimentation and 99.97% after filtration and did not significantly decrease after ozonation or final chlorination. The viruses isolated from treated waters were all enteroviruses: poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, coxsackievirus types B3, B4, and B5, echovirus type 7, and untyped picornaviruses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Payment", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trudel", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plante", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus B, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Picornaviridae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Poliovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bull World Health Organ. 1973;48(3):263-8", "ArticleIdList": ["4355401"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1978 Jul;36(1):36-42", "ArticleIdList": ["100052"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1980 Apr;26(4):518-23", "ArticleIdList": ["6247048"]}, {"Citation": "J Clin Microbiol. 1981 Feb;13(2):388-9", "ArticleIdList": ["6259203"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1981 Apr;27(4):417-20", "ArticleIdList": ["6263440"]}, {"Citation": "J Gen Virol. 1981 Jul;55(Pt 1):223-7", "ArticleIdList": ["6170725"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1982 Feb;43(2):488-90", "ArticleIdList": ["7036902"]}, {"Citation": "J Virol Methods. 1982 Dec;5(5-6):301-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6298266"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1983 Jan;29(1):111-9", "ArticleIdList": ["6299493"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1984 Jan;47(1):144-50", "ArticleIdList": ["6320720"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1984 Feb;47(2):319-24", "ArticleIdList": ["6324672"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1984 Mar;47(3):591-2", "ArticleIdList": ["6324679"]}, {"Citation": "Can J Microbiol. 1984 Jan;30(1):105-12", "ArticleIdList": ["6713298"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1985 Apr;49(4):981-3", "ArticleIdList": ["2988441"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2990337", "PMC241740", "10.1128/aem.49.6.1418-1428.1985"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
