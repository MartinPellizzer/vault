The catalysts were characterized by N<sub>2</sub>-physisorption measurements, powder X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Among the ordered mesoporous catalysts, \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (meso) had the highest toluene removal efficiency because of its highest surface area and pore volume, which in turn was selected for further investigation. Manganese (Mn) was introduced to various Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to improve the toluene removal efficiency. Comparing the Mn-loaded catalysts supported on various Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with different crystalline phases or pore structures, Mn/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (meso), had the highest catalytic activity as well as the highest CO<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio. The higher activity was attributed to the larger surface area, weaker interaction between Mn and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and larger portion of Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase. The increase in ozone concentration led to an improvement in the carbon balance but this enhancement was insufficient due to the deposition of by-products on the catalyst. After long term tests at room temperature, the reaction intermediates and carbonaceous deposits of the used catalysts were identified."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
