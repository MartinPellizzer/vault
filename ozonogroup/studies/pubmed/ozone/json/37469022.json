The available literature was searched according to Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (PECOS) database defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a meta-analysis was conducted whenever possible. Data obtained through PECOS characterized information from the USA, Europe, Australia, and some Asian countries; South American countries were seldom characterized, and no data were available for Africa and Russia. Extremely high levels of pollutants, mostly of fine fraction of particulate matter (PM) and ozone, were associated with intense WF emissions in North America, Oceania, and Asia and reported to exceed several-fold the WHO guidelines. Adverse health outcomes include emergency department visits and hospital admissions for cardiorespiratory diseases as well as mortality. Despite the heterogeneity among exposure and health assessment methods, all-cause mortality, and specific-cause mortality were significantly associated with WF emissions in most of the reports. Globally, a significant association was found for all-cause respiratory outcomes including asthma, but mixed results were noted for cardiovascular-related effects. For the latter, estimates were only significant several days after WF emissions, suggesting a more delayed impact on the heart. Different research gaps are presented, including the need for the application of standardized protocols for assessment of both exposure and adverse health risks. Mitigation actions also need to be strengthened, including dedicated efforts to communicate with the affected populations, to engage them for adoption of protective behaviors and measures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1779-7688"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "REQUIMTE/LAQV, Instituto Superior de Engenharia Do Porto, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Do Porto, Porto, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Barros", "ForeName": "Bela", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4150-0151"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "REQUIMTE/LAQV, Instituto Superior de Engenharia Do Porto, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Do Porto, Porto, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Marta", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6433-5801"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "REQUIMTE/LAQV, Instituto Superior de Engenharia Do Porto, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Do Porto, Porto, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Morais", "ForeName": "Simone", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Systematic Review", "Meta-Analysis", "Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "9802627", "ISSNLinking": "1093-7404"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wildfires"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37469022", "10.1080/10937404.2023.2236548"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
