Plastic has become an indispensable material in various industries and daily use scenarios, yet the VOC emissions and associated health risks in the plastic manufacturing industry have received limited attention. In this study, we conducted sampling in three typical plastic manufacturing factories to analyze the emission characteristics of VOCs, ozone formation potential (OFP), and health risks for workers. Isopropanol was detected at relatively high concentrations in all three factories, with concentrations in organized emissions reaching 322.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 344.8\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and 22.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Alkanes are the most emitted category of VOCs in plastic factories. However, alkenes and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) exhibit higher OFP. In organized emissions of different types of VOCs in the three factories, alkenes and OVOCs contributed 22.8%, 67%, and 37.8% to the OFP, respectively, highlighting the necessity of controlling them. The hazard index (HI) for all three factories was less than 1, indicating a low non-carcinogenic toxic risk; however, there is still a possibility of non-cancerous health risks in two of the factories, and a potential lifetime cancer risk in all of the three factories. For workers with job tenures exceeding 5 years, there may be potential health risks, hence wearing masks with protective capabilities is necessary. This study provides evidence for reducing VOC emissions and improving management measures to ensure the health protection of workers in the plastic manufacturing industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
