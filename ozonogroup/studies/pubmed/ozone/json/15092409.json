Klaxon) plants, 9 days old, were exposed to 0.05, 0.10 or 0.15 microl litre(-1) ozone (O3) for 12 days. Fumigation was administered for 7 h between 9.00 h and 16.00 h each day. Using conventional IRGA equipment, the carbon dioxide exchange rate (CER) was shown to decrease with increasing concentration of O3 during the exposure period, falling to 60% of the control value at the highest O3 concentration. Transpiration rates and stomatal conductance showed similar trends. Light saturation curves, obtained using a leaf disc oxygen electrode, demonstrated that O3-treated leaves had lower apparent quantum yields (QY) and generally lower rates of O2 evolution at saturating light and CO2 levels. Oscillations in chlorophyll a fluorescence, normally observed in control plants, could not be detected after O3 treatment and could only be restored to some extent by feeding the phosphate sequestering agent D-mannose to the leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, Lancashire, LA1 4YQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rowland-Bamford", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coghlan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lea", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092409", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90101-2", "0269-7491(89)90101-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
