Lu) in Zibo in July 2020. The VOCs pollution characteristics and chemical reactivity were analyzed, and the sources of VOCs were identified using the positive matrix factorization model(PMF). The results showed that <i>\u03c1</i>(TVOC) and <i>\u03c1</i>(NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) were higher at the urban site, but <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>) was higher at the background site. Diurnal average characteristics of <i>\u03c1</i>(TVOC) and <i>\u03c1</i>(NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) were high at night and low during the day at the urban site, and there were no obvious variation characteristics at the background site. The diurnal average characteristics of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>) were consistent at the urban and background sites, showing low level at night and high level during the day; however, the peak in the background site was later than that at the urban site. The average <i>\u03c1</i>(TVOC) at the urban site and background site were (44.9\u00b127.5) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and (17.3\u00b19.1) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, and the mass fraction of each component was ordered as alkanes>aromatics>alkenes>alkynes in both sites. The average ozone formation potentials(OFP)were (115.5\u00b163.1) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and (38.0\u00b120.2) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the contribution of each component was ordered as alkenes>aromatics>alkanes>alkynes. The respective average values of\u00b7OH radical loss rate(<i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>) were (3.9\u00b12.3) s<sup>-1</sup> and (1.0\u00b10.6) s<sup>-1</sup>, with the highest contribution of alkenes and the lowest contribution of alkynes in both sites. The average values of secondary organic aerosol formation potential(SOA<sub>p</sub>) were (0.5\u00b10.3) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and (0.2\u00b10.06) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, with aromatic being the most abundant group. According to the source appointment by the PMF model, the main source of VOCs in the urban site was traffic sources (52.4%), followed by petroleum evaporation (19.2%), solvent evaporation (17.3%), and oil and biological sources (11.1%). The source of VOCs in the background site mainly came from traffic sources (40.2%), followed by solvent evaporation (31.3%), combustion sources (19.3%), and biological sources (9.2%). Zibo City should strengthen the management and control of motor vehicle emissions, petroleum evaporation, and the use of industrial solvents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin 300384, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Zibo Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Zibo 255000, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Zibo Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Zibo 255000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin-Wu", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li-Ming", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin 300384, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Chun-Mei", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35258192", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202107133"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
