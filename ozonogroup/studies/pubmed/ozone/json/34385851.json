Most of the studies in the literature are related to the treatment of synthetically prepared dyed wastewater. This study is important as it is carried out with real wastewater and gives results of many treatment methods. In the study, COD, UV-vis absorbance, and color values were attempted to be removed from the wastewater of a chemical producing industry that was pretreated by coagulation-flocculation. The COD value of the pretreated wastewater discharged to the\u00a0central treatment system was restricted as 1000 mg/L. Pretreated wastewater characterization is as follows: COD: 2117 mg/L, UV-vis absorbance values at; 254 nm: 9.91, 280 nm: 8.65, 341 nm: 12.77, 436 nm: 5.01, 525 nm: 2.24, and 620 nm: 1.59. In the study, adsorption, ozonation, and advanced oxidation processes (Fenton and persulfate oxidation) were used to remove COD and UV-vis absorbance values (aromaticity, organics, and color). The method by which the best removal efficiency was obtained for all parameters was the adsorption process using powdered activated carbon (PAC). The equilibrium PAC dose was found as 6 g/L. At this adsorbent dose, the removal efficiencies of UV-vis absorbance values were all around 99% and the efficiency of COD removal was 77%. The Langmuir isotherm constants were found to be q<sub>max</sub>= 30.4 mg/g and K<sub>L</sub> = 487.9 (L/mg). The COD concentration at this adsorbent dose was 486 mg/L and wastewater was suitable for discharge to the central wastewater treatment plant in that region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1457-1504"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, \u00c7orlu Engineering Faculty, Nam\u0131k Kemal University, Tekirda\u011f Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcne\u015f", "ForeName": "El\u00e7in", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7527-6130"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, \u00c7orlu Engineering Faculty, Nam\u0131k Kemal University, Tekirda\u011f Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7if\u00e7i", "ForeName": "Deniz \u0130zlen", "Initials": "D\u0130"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9294-0643"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, \u00c7orlu Engineering Faculty, Nam\u0131k Kemal University, Tekirda\u011f Turkey."}], "LastName": "Din\u00e7er", "ForeName": "Ali R\u0131za", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8697-3345"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, \u00c7orlu Engineering Faculty, Nam\u0131k Kemal University, Tekirda\u011f Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcne\u015f", "ForeName": "Yal\u00e7\u0131n", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Turk J Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101259104", "ISSNLinking": "1300-0527"}, "CoiStatement": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST: none declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Waste minimization in the chemical industry: from theory to practice.
