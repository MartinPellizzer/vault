Rats in the control group were taken saline. ADC was performed by rectal way with 4% acetic acid in groups 2 and 3, and the group 3 was treated with medical ozone for three weeks both rectally and intraperitoneally. At the twenty second day the distal colons samples were obtained for malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase, blood samples were obtained to measure the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels. Histolopatological examination was evaluated with Ki-67, IL-1\u03b2 and VEGF immunostaining densities.", "There was significant increase in tissue MDA, MPO activity, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 after ozone administration. There was also a significant difference at immunostaining densities of histopathological examination.", "Medical ozone treatment ameliorated the experimental acute distal colitis induced by acetic acid in rats. Its possible effect is by means of decreasing inflammation, edema, and affecting the proliferation and the vascularization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
