Results showed that, compared with pristine PVDF membrane (MBR_M<sub>0</sub>), 0.75\u00a0wt% and 1.00\u00a0wt% nano-MnO<sub>2</sub> modified PVDF membrane (MBR_M<sub>0.75</sub> and MBR_M<sub>1.00</sub>) could mitigate the membrane biofouling rate. Meanwhile MBR_M<sub>1.00</sub> coupled with in-situ ozonation could increase the membrane cleaning cycle to 1.5 and 2.7 times, compared with MBR_M<sub>0</sub> and MBR_M<sub>0.75</sub> without in-situ ozonation. The possible mechanisms included that the nano-MnO<sub>2</sub> modification coupled with in-situ ozonation directly removed the biofouling on the membrane surface, improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface and enhanced the chemical oxidation and biodegradation of membrane biofouling contaminants in the sludge mixture. The results of this work provide a new strategy for the control of membrane biofouling in MBR to treat industrial wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
