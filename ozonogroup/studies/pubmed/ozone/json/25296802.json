The adiabatic electronic potentials are evaluated using dynamically weighted state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field theory. Quasi-diabatic states are constructed from the adiabatic states by maximizing the charge separation between the states. The dissociation dynamics are then simulated on the diabatically coupled excited electronic states. The B \u2190 X electronic transition with large oscillator strength was used to initiate dynamics on the S2 (B) excited singlet state. Diabatic coupling of the B state with other dissociative singlet states results in about 5% of the population evolving to the lowest spin-allowed asymptote, generating H2CO (X\u2009(1)A1) and O ((1)D) fragments. The remaining \u223c95% of the population remains on repulsive B state and dissociates to H2CO (a\u2009(3)A\u2033) and O ((3)P) products associated with a higher asymptotic limit. Due to the dissociative nature of the B state, the simulated electronic absorption spectrum is found to be broad and devoid of any vibrational structure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6323, USA."}], "LastName": "Samanta", "ForeName": "Kousik", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6323, USA."}], "LastName": "Beames", "ForeName": "Joseph M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6323, USA."}], "LastName": "Lester", "ForeName": "Marsha I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6323, USA."}], "LastName": "Subotnik", "ForeName": "Joseph E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25296802", "10.1063/1.4894746"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
