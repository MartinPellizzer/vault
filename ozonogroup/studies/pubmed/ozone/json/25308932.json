The HVACP discharge was generated between two aluminium plate electrodes using a high voltage of 70kVRMS. The effects of process parameters, including treatment time, mode of exposure (direct/indirect), and working gas types, were evaluated. The influence of relative humidity on HVACP inactivation efficacy was also assessed. The inactivation efficacy was evaluated using colony counts. Optical absorption spectroscopy (OAS) was used to assess gas composition following HVACP exposure.", "A strong effect of process parameters on inactivation was observed. Direct plasma exposure for 60s resulted in \u22656 log10 cycle reduction of spores in all gas types tested. However, indirect exposure for 60s resulted in either 2.1 or 6.3 log10 cycle reduction of spores depending on gas types used for HVACP generation. The relative humidity (RH) was a critical factor in bacterial spore inactivation by HVACP, where a major role of plasma-generated species other than ozone was noted. Direct and indirect HVACP exposure for 60s at 70% RH recorded 6.3 and 5.7 log10 cycle reduction of spores, respectively.", "In summary, a strong influence of process parameters on spore inactivation was noted. Rapid in-package HVACP inactivation of bacterial spores within 30-60s demonstrates the promising potential application for reduction of spores on medical devices and heat-sensitive materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society.
