The antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and reperfusion effects of ozone gas have been previously assessed, and successful results have been reported. However, only one study has investigated the effect of ozone gas on flap viability. In the present study, it was hypothesised that the antioxidant and reperfusion effects of ozone gas would enhance flap viability.", "Forty female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups of 10 rats each. A cranial-based, 3\u2009\u00d7\u200911\u2009cm modified McFarlane flap including the panniculus carnosus was raised from the dorsum of a rat and re-sutured to its own bed using 3/0 sharp propylene. Group 1 (n\u2009=\u200910): no pharmacological agent was used after the operation. Group 2 (n\u2009=\u200910): vegetable (olive) oil group; vegetable-oil-impregnated gauze was used as a dressing for 7 days. Group 3 (n\u2009=\u200910): Vegetable (olive) oil with ozone peroxide group; vegetable oil with ozone peroxide-impregnated gauze was used as a dressing for 7 days. Group 4 (n\u2009=\u200910): Hemo-ozone therapy group; hemo-ozone therapy was applied rectally once every day for 7 days. All rats were sacrificed at the end of week 1 and assessed macroscopically and histopathologically.", "The proportion of substantive necrosis was less in group 4 than in the other three groups. Survival area ratios were better in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1; however, there was no significant difference between groups 2 and 3. No significant differences in the histopathological scores were observed among the groups.", "Ozone gas enhanced flap viability. No differences in flap viability were observed between the vegetable oil and vegetable oil with ozone peroxide groups. The greatest benefit ratios were found in the hemo-ozone therapy group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Bulent Ecevit University Medical Faculty, Department of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery , Zonguldak , Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcner", "ForeName": "Mehmet Ha\u015fim", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Bulent Ecevit University Medical Faculty, Department of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery , Zonguldak , Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc", "ForeName": "Tahsin", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Bulent Ecevit University Medical Faculty, Department of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery , Zonguldak , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Olgun", "ForeName": "Abdulkerim", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Bulent Ecevit University Medical Faculty, Department of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery , Zonguldak , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Torun", "ForeName": "Merve", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Bulent Ecevit University Medical Faculty, Department of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery , Zonguldak , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kargi", "ForeName": "Eksal", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Sweden", "MedlineTA": "J Plast Surg Hand Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101534130", "ISSNLinking": "2000-6764"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bandages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Graft Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Flaps"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27109505", "10.3109/2000656X.2016.1170024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
