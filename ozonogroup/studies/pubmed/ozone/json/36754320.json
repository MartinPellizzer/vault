Understanding the spatiotemporal varying effects of driving factors of NO<sub>2</sub> is vital for the implementation of differentiated air pollution control measures for different port areas. Based on the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data, we adopted a Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model to explore the influences of meteorological and socioeconomic factors on the NO<sub>2</sub> Vertical Column Concentrations (VCDs) in coastal ports of China from 2015 to 2021. The results indicate that NO<sub>2</sub> VCD in most ports has decreased since 2016 and the ports with serious NO<sub>2</sub> pollution are mainly distributed in northern China. The associations between NO<sub>2</sub> VCD levels and their drivers exhibit obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Higher wind speed and relative humidity are more helpful to alleviate NO<sub>2</sub> pollution in ports of the Bohai Rim and the Pearl River Delta. Cargo throughput has more closely associated with NO<sub>2</sub> pollution in Beibu Gulf in recent years, yet there is no significant association found for Shanghai ports. The positive relationship between transportation emissions and NO<sub>2</sub> VCD is more significant in southern ports. This work provides some implications for the formulation of targeted emission reduction policies for different ports along the Chinese coast."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
