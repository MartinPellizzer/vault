We evaluated the prophylactic effect of O3/O2-PP combined with tazobactam/piperacillin (TZP) in polymicrobial lethal peritonitis. Wistar rats were conditioned by daily repeated insufflation of ozone for 5 days, and hematologic parameters were determined. Sepsis was induced by i.p. injection of cecal material derived from donor rats. Simultaneously, TZP was applied at a single dosage of 65 mg/kg or at two dosage schedules of 65 mg/kg each at an interval of 1 h. The conditioning effect of O3/O2-PP on the number of blood cells was measured before inoculation of bacteria. The mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-lbeta and TNF-alpha were determined at 4 h post infection in spleen and liver by semiquantitative in situ hybridization analysis. Preconditioning of rats by O3/O2-PP enhanced the number of blood leukocytes and granulocytes and increased the survival rate of septic rats up to 33%. The combination of O3/O2-PP and TZP further enhanced the survival rate up to 93%. This effect was accompanied by a reduced amount of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA in spleen and liver. In contrast, in non-infected animals the combination of O3/O2-PP and TZP enhanced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA in the spleen and IL-1beta mRNA in liver when compared with TZP- and sham-treated controls. The preconditioning effect of O3/O2-PP seems to support the biological effectiveness of TZP by altering the immune status before and during the onset of sepsis. The combined therapy could be a simple, preoperative intervention for abdominal surgery to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Philipps-University of Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bette", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "N\u00fcsing", "ForeName": "Rolf M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mutters", "ForeName": "Reinier", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zamora", "ForeName": "Zullyt B", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Menendez", "ForeName": "Silvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "Siegfried", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Shock", "NlmUniqueID": "9421564", "ISSNLinking": "1073-2322"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "87-53-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Penicillanic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SE10G96M8W", "NameOfSubstance": "Tazobactam"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X00B0D5O0E", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperacillin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillanic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Peritonitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Piperacillin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumoperitoneum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tazobactam"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16369182", "10.1097/01.shk.0000187983.56030.dd", "00024382-200601000-00005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
