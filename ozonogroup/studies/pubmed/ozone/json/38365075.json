Here, a total of 98 VOCs species were monitored in an economy-active city in China from January 2021 to August 2022 to assess contributions to ozone formation during the pandemic. Total VOCs concentrations were 35.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.47\u00a0ppb during the entire period, among which alkanes account for the largest fraction (13.78\u00a0ppb, 38.0%), followed by aromatics (6.16\u00a0ppb, 16.8%) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs, 5.69\u00a0ppb, 15.7%). Most VOCs groups (e.g., alkenes, OVOCs) and individual species (e.g., isoprene, methyl vinyl ketone) display obvious seasonal and diurnal variations, which are related to their sources and reactivities. No weekend effects of VOCs suggest limited influences from traffic emissions during pandemic. Aromatics and alkenes are the major contributors (39% and 33%) to ozone formation potential, largely driven by o/m/p-xylene (21%), ethylene (15%), toluene (9%). Secondary organic aerosol formation potential is dominated by toluene (>50%) despite its low proportion (5%). Further inclusion of VOCs and meteorology in the Random Forest model shows good ozone prediction performance (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.77-0.86, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a011.95-19.91\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, MAE\u00a0=\u00a08.89-14.58\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). VOCs and NO<sub>2</sub> contribute >50% of total importance with the largest difference in importance ratio of VOCs/NO<sub>2</sub> in the summer and winter, implying ozone formation regime may vary. No seasonal variations in importance of meteorology are observed, while importance of other variables (e.g., PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is highest in the summer. This work identifies critical VOCs groups and species for ozone formation during the pandemic, and demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning algorithms in elucidation of ozone formation mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
