For this purpose, A. arguta fruit was ozonated with gas at a concentration of 10 and 100\u00a0ppm, which was carried out successively for 5, 15 and 30\u00a0min. Next, the selected quality attributes, antioxidants level as well as NADPH and mitochondrial energy metabolism in mini-kiwi fruit after ozonation were analysed. Our research has shown that ozonation reduced the level of yeast and mould without affecting the content of soluble solids or acidity. In turn, ozonation clearly influenced the antioxidant activity and the redox status of the fruit. The ozonated fruit was characterised by a lower level of ROS due to the higher level of low molecular weight antioxidants, as well as the higher activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase. In addition, improved quality and antioxidant activity of the fruit were indirectly due to improved energy metabolism and NADPH level. The ozonated fruit showed a higher level of ATP, due to both higher activity of succinate dehydrogenase and higher availability of NADH. Moreover, the increased level of NAD<sup>+</sup> and the activity of NAD<sup>+</sup>\u00a0kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase contributed to higher levels of NADPH in the fruit."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
