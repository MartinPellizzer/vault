Carboxylic acids found in the particulate phase were derivatized to 2,2,2-trifuoroethylamides by reaction with 3-ethyl-1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine hydrochloride (TFEA). Carbonyl compounds collected in both gas phase and particulate phase were derivatized to their respective oximes by reaction with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro-benzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA). The ozonolysis of \u03b1-pinene yielded the carboxylic acids: cis-pinonic acid and pinic acid and the proposed carboxylic acids methanetricarboxylic acid and terpenylic acid; the carbonyls: 4-oxopentanal, norpinonaldehyde, pinon aldehyde and the proposed carbonyl methylidenepropanedial. The ozonolysis of limonene yielded the carboxylic acids: limonic acid and pinic acid and the carbonyls: 1-(4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)ethanone (4AMCH), glyoxal, methyl glyoxal, 4-oxopentanal and 6-oxo-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)heptanal (IPOH). The ozonolysis of \u03b1-terpineol yielded the proposed carboxylic acids: terpenylic acid and homoterpenylic acid and the carbonyls: (5E)-6-hydroxyhept-5-en-2-one, methyl glyoxal and 4-oxopentanal."], "CopyrightInformation": "This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA. ozw0@cdc.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wells", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22334151", "10.1039/c2em10799f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
