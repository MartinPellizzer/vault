Effective removal of harmful cyanobacteria with little to no cell damage is very important to ensure the safety of drinking water. This review first introduced development history of cyanobacterial removal technologies in drinking water treatment. Then, impacts of oxidation, coagulation and pre-oxidation enhanced coagulation processes on cyanobacterial removal and integrity of the cells were comprehensively evaluated and discussed. Oxidation can remove cyanobacteria, but high doses of oxidants can result in significant cell lysis and release of intracellular metabolites, especially when using chlorine or ozone. Although there is practically no cell damage during coagulation, the removal efficiency is low in many cases. Pre-oxidation may improve cyanobacterial removal by the subsequent solid-liquid separation processes, and moderate pre-oxidation with little to no cell lysis is very important. Mechanisms of interface interaction between pre-oxidants and cyanobacteria should be defined in future to ensure moderate pre-oxidation of algal cells. Fate of cyanobacterial cells in sludge is also reviewed because more and more waterworks return sludge supernatant to the inlet of plant. Damage to cyanobacterial cells in sludge depends mainly upon coagulant type and dosage, algal species, and cyanobacteria-containing sludge should be treated before cell lysis. Efficient techniques for harmless disposal of cyanobacteria-containing sludge should be developed in future. This paper will help to better understand the cyanobacterial removal processes and provide improved perspectives for future research in this field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
