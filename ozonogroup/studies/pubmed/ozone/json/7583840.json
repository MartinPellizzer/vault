All residences were in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. The relation of the polar VOCs to the ozone concentration was examined. Indoor carbonyl concentrations were similar between the summer and winter, with the total mean winter concentration being 31.7 ppb and the total mean summer concentration being 36.6 ppb. However, the average air exchange rate was 0.9 hr-1 during the winter and 2.6 hr-1 during the summer. Therefore, the estimated carbonyl emission rates were significantly higher during the summer. Indoor organic acid concentrations were about twice as high during the summer as during the winter. For formic acid, the indoor winter mean was 9.8 ppb, and the summer indoor mean was 17.8 ppb. For acetic acid, the indoor winter mean was 15.5 ppb, and the summer indoor mean was 28.7 ppb. The concentrations of the polar VOCs were found to be significantly correlated with one another. Also, the emission rates of the polar VOCs were found to be correlated with both the environmental variables such as temperature and relative humidity and the ozone removal rate; however, it was difficult to apportion the relative effects of the environmental variables and the ozone removal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard University, School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reiss", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryan", "ForeName": "P B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tibbetts", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ESO7155", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7583840", "10.1080/10473289.1995.10467411"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
