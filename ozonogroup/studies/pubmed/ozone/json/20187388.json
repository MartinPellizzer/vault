The removal mechanisms of Cyclops in different treatment units were analyzed. The experiments results show that the inactivation rate of chlorine (25%) is the highest compared with the chloramines (21%), potassium permanganate composite (8%) and O3 (9%) in the pre-oxidation stage, while the removal rate is changed after the filtration and the sequence is chloramines (90%) > chlorine (88%) > O3 (83%) > potassium permanganate composite (80%). Only chloramines can remove Cyclops by 100% of removal rate with the treatment process with the conventional active carbon unit. The 100% of removal effect doesn't depend on the highest inactivation rate,but the reasonable cooperation between the pre-oxidation and the clarification treatment process. The size of Cyclops and its life activity are the important influencing factors. The individual removal rate of filtration unit is the highest with no lower than 50%. The removal effect of air-flotation unit is influenced by the size of Cyclops and its life activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zmin_2008@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Fu-yi", "Initials": "FY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dong-mei", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Wen-jie", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Hong-da", "Initials": "HD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KW8K411A1P", "NameOfSubstance": "chloramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Copepoda"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20187388"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
