Experiments were conducted at typical room temperatures and air exchange rates. Limonene ozonolysis produced the highest SOA mass concentrations and linalool the lowest with \u03b1-pinene being intermediate. Simplified empirical modeling simulations were conducted to provide insights into reaction chemistry. Assessment of variability of particle-bound reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be important in the understanding of health effects associated with particulate matter. The ROS intensities defined as ROS/SOA mass were found to be moderately correlated with the SOA densities. Greater ROS intensities were observed for the cases where ozone was in excess. ROS intensities approached a relatively constant value in the region where ozone was in deficit. The estimated initial ROS half-life time was approximately 6.5 h at room temperature suggesting the time sensitivity of ROS measurements. The ROS formed from terpenoid ozonolysis could be separated into three categories: short-lived/high reactive/volatile, semivolatile/relatively stable and nonvolatile/low reactive species based on ROS measurements under various conditions. Such physical characterization of the ROS in terms of reactivity and volatility provides some insights into the nature of ROS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Air Resources Engineering and Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York 13699-5708, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hopke", "ForeName": "Philip K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carter", "ForeName": "William P L", "Initials": "WP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D81QY6I88E", "NameOfSubstance": "linalool"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21121662", "10.1021/es102166c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
