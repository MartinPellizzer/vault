This study aimed to address this gap by developing random forest models for four key pollutants (fine and inhalable particulate matter [PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>], nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>] and O<sub>3</sub>) by integrating multiple-source predictors at a daily level and 1-km resolution. The out-of-bag R<sup>2</sup> (root mean squared error, RMSE) between predictions from models and measurements from monitoring stations in 2006-2013 was 0.85 (3.63\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 0.77 (6.00\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for PM<sub>10</sub>, 0.85 (9.71\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for NO<sub>2</sub>, and 0.85 (9.39\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> at daily level, and the predicting accuracy was higher at monthly and annual level. The high-resolution predictions captured characterized spatiotemporal patterns of the four pollutants. Higher concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> were distributed in densely populated southern regions of Great Britain while O<sub>3</sub> showed an inverse spatial pattern in general, which could not be fully depicted by monitoring stations. Therefore, predictions produced in this study could improve exposure assessment with less exposure misclassification and flexible exposure windows for future epidemiological studies to investigate the impact of air pollution across Great Britain."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
