However, as it is difficult to obtain graphene with high structural precision, it is currently unfeasible to comprehend the relationships between the intrinsic structure of the layered carbon catalysts with its catalytic activities. Here, an advanced plasma-assisted etch strategy was used to fine tune the ozonation activity of monolayered graphene films by tailoring the defect types. Raman mapping indicated that the defects of the as-prepared monolayered graphene films were predominantly sp<sup>3</sup>, vacancy, and boundary-type defects, respectively. The roles and contributions of these active defects in manipulating the oxidative potential of monolayered graphene films were revealed by quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance results, and density functional theory calculations. The catalytic results showed that the monolayered graphene films with boundary-like defects exhibited the best catalytic performance toward the degradation of sulfamethoxazole. This work contributes new insights into the design of high-efficiency carbonaceous catalysts by structuring additional defective sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wenjie", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1924-2598"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Institute of Advanced Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yenan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4687-622X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yuanting", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical Center for Multifunctional Magneto-Optical Spectroscopy (Shanghai), Department of Materials, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1471-8876"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Haitao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory for Urban Ecological Processes and Eco-Restoration, School of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Zhen", "ForeName": "Guangyin", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Display Material and Technology, School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4683-2112"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Qinghong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Nanophotonics and Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Institute of Advanced Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhuo", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34706192", "10.1021/acsami.1c16920"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
