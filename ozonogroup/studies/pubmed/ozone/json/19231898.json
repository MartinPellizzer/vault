The resulting surface morphology and surface hydrophilicity have been studied by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TP-AFM) and a combination of water contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Our AFM results revealed that zein films cast from acetic acid showed much smoother surfaces as compared to those cast from ethanol aqueous solutions. Furthermore, zein films of controlled hydrophilicity have been engineered through the use of UV/ozone treatment, which can efficiently decrease the water contact angles of zein films from approximately 80 degrees to less than 10 degrees within 130 s. XPS results suggest that the difference in surface hydrophilicity of zein films is due to the difference in surface elemental composition, and UV/ozone treatment converted some of the surface methyl groups mainly to carbonyl groups, therefore decreasing the water contact angles and increasing the surface hydrophilicity of zein films. This research opens up new opportunities of using zein as barrier materials and delivery vehicles for functional food ingredients, drugs, and dietary supplements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kokini", "ForeName": "Jozef L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qingrong", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9010-66-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Zein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Atomic Force"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19231898", "10.1021/jf803559v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
