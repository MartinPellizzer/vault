A high-density polymer brush of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) was precisely prepared on the surface of a flexible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrate oxidized in ultraviolet/ozone (UVO). Exposure times less than 10min resulted in laterally homogeneous oxidized surfaces, characterized by a SiO<sub>x</sub> thickness \u223c35nm and an increased modulus up to 9MPa, as shown by AFM nanoindentation measurements. We have demonstrated that a high surface density of up to \u223c0.63chains/nm<sup>2</sup> of the well-defined PHEMA brushes can be grown from the surface of oxidized PDMS by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) from trimethoxysilane derivatives mixed-SAM. The reversible nanomechanical changes of PHEMA layer between extended (hydrated state) and collapsed (dehydrated state) chain upon immersing in selective and non-selective solvents were investigated by in situ AFM nanoindentation analysis in liquid environments. The elastic modulus derived from force-indentation curves obtained for swollen PHEMA grafted chains in water was estimated to be equal 2.7\u00b10.2MPa, which is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the modulus of dry PHEMA brush. Additionally, under cyclohexane immersion, the modulus of the PHEMA layer decreased by one order of magnitude, indicating a more compact chain packing at the PDMS surface."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
