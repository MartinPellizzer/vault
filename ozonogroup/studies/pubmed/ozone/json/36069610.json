Observations were conducted during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (associated with reduced anthropogenic emissions). The spatial distribution of missing OH reactivity highlights that the origin of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may be from natural-emission areas. For the first time, the real-time loss rates of HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> onto ambient aerosols were measured continuously and alternately. Ozone production sensitivity was investigated considering unknown trace species and heterogeneous loss effects of XO<sub>2</sub> (\u2261HO<sub>2</sub> + RO<sub>2</sub>) radicals. Missing OH reactivity enhanced the ozone production potential by a factor of 2.5 on average. Heterogeneous loss of radicals could markedly suppress ozone production under low NO/NO<sub>x</sub> conditions with slow gas-phase reactions of radicals and change the ozone regime from VOC- to NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive conditions. This study quantifies the relationship of missing OH reactivity and aerosol uptake of radicals with ozone production in Kyoto, a low-emission suburban area. The result has implications for future NO<sub>x</sub>-reduction policies. Further studies may benefit from the combination of chemical transport models and inverse modeling over a wide spatiotemporal range."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3576-9859"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Environment Conservation Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiaru", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kohno", "ForeName": "Nanase", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9863-4241"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Environment Conservation Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8316, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Yosuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan."}], "LastName": "Pham", "ForeName": "Huy Gia", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan."}], "LastName": "Murano", "ForeName": "Kentaro", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3716-3730"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Environment Conservation Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Science and Graduate School of Fisheries and Environmental Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakayama", "ForeName": "Tomoki", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Environment Conservation Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8316, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kajii", "ForeName": "Yoshizumi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Aerosols and Droplets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36069610", "10.1021/acs.est.2c03628"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
