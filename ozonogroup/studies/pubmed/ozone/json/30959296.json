The hypothesis is based on the fact that complex microclimate conditions under cloudy sky usually stimulate stomatal conductance. O<sub>3</sub> fluxes were inferred from a concentration gradient in a mountainous Norway spruce forest in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) for years 2012-2016 and measured directly by eddy-covariance during the summer of 2017. Daily and seasonal O<sub>3</sub> depositions were calculated separately for days with cloudy, partly cloudy, and clear sky conditions. The data show unequivocally that more O<sub>3</sub> is taken up under cloudy and partially cloudy skies. Moreover, we found significant interactive effects of sky conditions and season on O<sub>3</sub> flux. Though there are other mechanisms and pathways involved in the transport of O<sub>3</sub> to the plant-soil system, the highest O<sub>3</sub> deposition was associated to the highest stomatal conductance during partly cloudy and cloudy sky conditions in all seasons, while lower O<sub>3</sub> ecosystem fluxes were observed under clear sky conditions despite the highest O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at this time. These findings suggest that forests growing at sites where conditions are predominantly cloudy are expected to deposit higher extent of O<sub>3</sub> than less-cloudy forests being thus more threatened by phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
