In the present study, we investigated the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on the metabolites and transcripts of tartary buckwheat. A total of 36 metabolites were identified by gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and principal component analysis was performed to verify the metabolic differences between nontreated and O<sub>3</sub>-treated tartary buckwheat. The content of threonic acid increased after 2 days of the O<sub>3</sub> treatment, whereas it decreased after 4 days of exposure, after which it gradually increased until the eighth day of exposure. In addition, the levels of most metabolites decreased significantly after the O<sub>3</sub> treatment. On the contrary, the levels of two anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside and cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-rutinoside, increased more than 11.36- and 11.43-fold, respectively, after the O<sub>3</sub> treatment. To assess the effect of O<sub>3</sub> on the genomic level, we analyzed the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes in O<sub>3</sub>-treated and nontreated buckwheat using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found that the expression of all anthocyanin pathway genes increased significantly in the O<sub>3</sub>-treated buckwheat compared to that in the nontreated buckwheat. Altogether, our results suggested that O<sub>3</sub> affected the transcripts and metabolites of tartary buckwheat, which would eventually cause phenotypic changes in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop Science, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences and Bio-Resource and Environmental Center, College of Life Sciences and Bioengineering, Incheon National University, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon 22012, Korea."}], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Seung-A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Smart Agriculture Systems, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Nam Su", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3516-9274"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop Science, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Korea."}], "LastName": "Sathasivam", "ForeName": "Ramaraj", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong Seok", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2692-5370"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences and Bio-Resource and Environmental Center, College of Life Sciences and Bioengineering, Incheon National University, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon 22012, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jae Kwang", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2157-2246"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop Science, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Smart Agriculture Systems, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sang Un", "Initials": "SU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanidin-3-O-beta-glucopyranoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OR49FC491X", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanidin 3-rutinoside"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["agonists", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fagopyrum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33264023", "10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04716"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
