In recent years, the presence of PPCPs has been detected in multiple drinking water sources in China. PPCPs are usually stable and resistant to degradation in aquatic environments. During chlorination, chloramination, and ozonation disinfection processes, PPCPs can act as precursor substances to generate N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) which is the most widely detected nitrosamine byproduct in drinking water. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of PPCPs in China's water environment on the generation of NDMA during disinfection processes to better understand the correlation between PPCPs and NDMA generation. Chloramine is the most likely to form NDMA with different disinfection methods, so chloramine disinfection may be the main pathway for NDMA generation. Activated carbon adsorption and UV photolysis are widely used in the removal of NDMA and its precursor PPCPs, and biological treatment is found to be a low-cost and high removal rate method for controlling the generation of NDMA. However, there are still certain regional limitations in the investigation and research on PPCPs, and other nitrosamine by-products such as NMEA, NDEA and NDBA should also be studied to investigate the formation mechanism and removal methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
