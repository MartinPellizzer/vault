The average volume fraction of VOCs was 32.7\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> during the high ozone season in Shanghai. Carbonyl compounds were the main components of VOCs, accounting for 35.0%. Among the carbonyl compounds, the volume fraction of formaldehyde was the highest, followed by acetone, accounting for 82.8% of the total carbonyl compounds. The chemical reaction activity of ambient air was the strongest in May, and the total ozone formation potential (OFP) was 337.2 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Formaldehyde had the highest contribution. The examination of the diurnal variations in alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics revealed higher average concentrations at nighttime than at daytime, with a small peak in the morning, which was related to the impact of traffic emissions. Aldehydes and ketones varied diurnally by having higher average concentrations during the daytime than those at nighttime, which was related to the secondary formation process of photochemical reactions. The observation-based model (OBM) showed that O<sub>3</sub> formation was in a VOC-limited regime from May to June and in a transition regime from July to August."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34989497", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202104012"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
