Phase separation of poly(2-vinylpyridine)-<i>b</i>-polystyrene (P2VP-<i>b</i>-PS) was induced by solvent vapor annealing in a nonselective solvent environment to fabricate cylindrical arrays. In this work, we thoroughly analyzed the effects of the film thickness, solvent annealing time, and temperature on the ordering of a P2VP-majority system for the first time, resulting in \"inverse\" structures. Reflectometry, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the formation of the highly ordered BCP morphology and the subsequently produced metal oxide film. At 40 min solvent annealing time, hexagonally close packed structures were produced with cylinder diameters \u223c40 nm. Subsequently, the BCP films were infiltrated with different metal cations. Metal ions (Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ga) selectively infiltrated the P2VP domain, while the PS did not retain any detectable amount of metal precursor. This gave rise to a metal oxide porous structure after a UV/ozone (UVO) treatment. The results showed that the metal oxide structures demonstrated high fidelity compared to the BCP template and cylindrical domains presented a similar size to the previous PS structure. Moreover, XPS analyses revealed the complete elimination of the BCP template and confirmed the presence of the metal oxides. These metal oxides were used as hard masks for pattern transfer <i>via</i> dry etching as a further application. Silicon nanopores were fabricated mimicking the BCP template and demonstrated a pore depth of \u223c50 nm. Ultimately, this strategy can be applied to create different inorganic nanostructures for a diverse range of applications, for example, solar cells, diodes, and integrated circuits. Furthermore, by optimizing the etching parameters, deeper structures can be obtained <i>via</i> ICP/RIE processes, leading to many potential applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2231-0360"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMBER Research Centre/School of Chemistry, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin D02W085, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Esmeraldo Paiva", "ForeName": "Aislan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMBER Research Centre/School of Chemistry, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin D02W085, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Baez Vasquez", "ForeName": "Jhonattan Frank", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1845-7100"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMBER Research Centre/School of Chemistry, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin D02W085, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Selkirk", "ForeName": "Andrew", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2535-7132"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMBER Research Centre/School of Chemistry, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin D02W085, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Prochukhan", "ForeName": "Nadezda", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology, Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri/UFVJM, Av. 01, 4050, Jana\u00faba, MG 39440-039, Brazil."}], "LastName": "G L Medeiros Borsagli", "ForeName": "Fernanda", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8756-4068"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMBER Research Centre/School of Chemistry, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin D02W085, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Morris", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35876355", "10.1021/acsami.2c10338"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
