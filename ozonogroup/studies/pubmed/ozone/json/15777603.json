In view of this, two multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind studies were conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of salmeterol xinafoate delivered by an MDI using the hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 134a propellant with the licensed CFC formulation (Serevent) in asthmatic populations of children (4-11 years) and adults (12 years). Patients on a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids with a scope for improvement based on mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) and symptoms were randomised to receive salmeterol HFA MDI 50 microg twice daily or salmeterol CFC MDI 50 microg twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was mean morning PEF and secondary variables included other lung function parameters, symptom scores, use of relief medication and safety assessments. The difference between the treatments in adjusted mean morning PEF (salmeterol HFA-salmeterol CFC) were 2.5 and -3.2 L/min for per-protocol populations of children and adults, respectively. The lower limit of 95% confidence intervals for both populations was within the pre-defined limit (-15 L/min) set for non-inferiority. Similar results were observed in intent-to-treat (ITT) populations. In children, the two formulations resulted in a lack of any statistically significant difference in secondary efficacy parameters. A significant difference at endpoint in clinic forced expiratory volume in 1s was reported in favour of the HFA formulation in the adult population, although the magnitude of this effect was not considered clinically significant. The incidences of adverse events (AEs) were similar for both formulations and populations, and no safety concerns were generated. Together these data demonstrate salmeterol HFA MDI to be as effective as salmeterol CFC MDI in adults and children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Global Commerical Strategy, Respiratory Building 38, 1 floor, Greenford Road, Greenford, Middlesex UB6 0HE, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chopra", "ForeName": "Narinder", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rimmer", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kahl", "ForeName": "Lesley", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jenkins", "ForeName": "Mair", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "CollectiveName": "SMO30006 and SMO30007 International Study Teams"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Respir Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8908438", "ISSNLinking": "0954-6111"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosol Propellants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6EW8Q962A5", "NameOfSubstance": "Salmeterol Xinafoate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QF8SVZ843E", "NameOfSubstance": "Albuterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R40P36GDK6", "NameOfSubstance": "apaflurane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosol Propellants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Albuterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metered Dose Inhalers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salmeterol Xinafoate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15777603", "10.1016/j.rmed.2004.11.002", "S0954-6111(04)00428-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
