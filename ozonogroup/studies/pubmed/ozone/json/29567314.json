In this work, we evaluated the importance of DNA repair performed by photolyases to maintain the performance of treefrog tadpoles after acute and chronic treatments with environmental-simulated doses of solar UVB and UVA radiation. Immediately after UV treatments, tadpoles were exposed to a visible light source to activate photolyases or kept in dark containers. The biological effects of UV treatments were evaluated through morphological, histological, locomotor and survival analyzes of Boana pulchella tadpoles (Anura: Hylidae). The results indicate that tadpole body weight suffered influence after both UVB and UVA treatments, although the body length was bit affected. The locomotor performance of UVB-exposed tadpoles was significantly reduced. In addition, UVB radiation induced a severe impact on tadpole skin, as well as on keratinized structures of mouth (tooth rows and jaw), indicating that these should be important effects of solar UV radiation in the reduction of tadpole performance. Furthermore, photolyases activation was fundamental for the maintenance of tadpole performance after chronic UVB exposures, but it was relatively inefficient after acute exposures to UVB, but not to UVA radiation. Therefore, this work demonstrates how the UV-induced genotoxicity and structural alterations in the skin and oral apparatus affect tadpole performance and survival."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
