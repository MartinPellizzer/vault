This poses some concerns as to whether defensive strategy to cope episodic O<sub>3</sub> peaks in healthy plants may fail under stress. In this study, a set of saplings of two Mediterranean deciduous species, Quercus cerris and Q. pubescens, was subjected to water withholding (20% of daily evapotranspiration for 15\u202fdays) while another set was kept well-watered. Saplings were then subjected to a pulse of O<sub>3</sub> (200\u202fnl\u202fl<sup>-1</sup> for 5\u202fh) or maintained in filtered air. Q. pubescens had a more severe decline of photosynthesis and leaf PD\u03a8<sub>w</sub> (about -65% and 5-fold lower than in well-watered ones) and events of cell death were observed under drought when compared to Q. cerris, which is supportive for a higher sensitivity to drought exhibited by this species. When O<sub>3</sub> was applied after drought, patterns of signalling compounds were altered in both species. Only in Q. pubescens, the typical O<sub>3</sub>-induced accumulation of apoplastic reactive oxygen species, which is the first necessary step for the activation of signalling cascade, was completely lost. In Q. cerris the most frequent changes encompassed the weakening of peaks of key signalling molecules (ethylene and salicylic acid), whereas in Q. pubescens both delayed (salicylic and jasmonic acid) or weakened (ethylene and salicylic acid) peaks were observed. This is translated to a higher ability of Q. cerris to maintain a prompt activation of defensive reaction to counteract oxidative damage due to the pollutant. Our results reveal the complexity of the signalling network in plants facing multiple stresses and highlight the need to further investigate possible alteration of defensive mechanism of tree species to predict their behavior."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
