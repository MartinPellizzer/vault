This study searched the databases of PubMed and Web of Science for eligible English articles and CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang, CBM, CSTP and other Chinese databases for eligible Chinese articles from inception until June 30, 2023. The language was limited to Chinese and English. <b>Results:</b> Among the 14 included articles, five studies investigated the impact of air pollution on DNA methylation age using different algorithms, while six studies explored the relationship between air pollutants and telomere length. Six studies focused on frailty as an outcome, and an additional study revealed the relationship between fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and its components with composite indicator age (KDM age). The results indicated that, although different forms of biological ages were susceptible to different ambient air pollutants at different degrees, previous studies had consistently found that the increased levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and one of its major components, black carbon (BC), could significantly accelerate the biological aging of middle-aged and older adults. Similar trends were observed with nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) but with relatively limited evidence. <b>Conclusion:</b> Major air pollutants could accelerate the biological aging of middle-aged and older adults."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "S Z", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "82304098", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2022-CKL-03", "Agency": "China Center for Disease Control Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review", "English Abstract"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7904962", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epigenesis, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "19"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38715498", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20231009-00247"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
