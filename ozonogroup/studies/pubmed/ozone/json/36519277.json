These molecules promote blood coagulation, wound healing, disinfection, and selective cancer cell death. Based on these evidences, clinical trials of NTP have been conducted for treating chronic wounds and head and neck cancers. Although clinical applications have progressed, the stoichiometric quantification of NTP-induced ROS remains unclear in the liquid phase in the presence of FeCl<sub>2</sub> or FeCl<sub>3</sub> in combination with biocompatible reducing agents, which may modulate the final biological effects of NTP. In this study, we employed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify ROS using spin-trapping probe, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-<i>N</i>-oxide (DMPO) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, using luminescent probe in the presence of FeCl<sub>2</sub> or FeCl<sub>3</sub>. NTP-induced DMPO-OH levels were elevated 10-100\u2009\u00b5M FeCl<sub>2</sub> or 500 and 1000\u2009\u00b5M FeCl<sub>3</sub>. NTP-induced DMPO-OH with 10\u2009\u00b5M FeCl<sub>2</sub> or FeCl<sub>3</sub> was significantly scavenged by ascorbate, \u03b1-tocopherol, dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, or oxidized glutathione, whereas dehydroascorbate was ineffective in 2\u2009mM DMPO. NTP-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was significantly degraded by 100\u2009\u00b5M FeCl<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub> in an iron-dependent manner. Meanwhile, decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by catalase decayed DMPO-OH efficiently in the presence of iron, indicating iron causes DMPO-OH production and degradation simultaneously. These results suggest that NTP-induced DMPO-OH is generated by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-consuming, iron-dependent Fenton reaction and ferryl intermediates. The potential iron-mediated ROS production by NTP is also discussed to clarify the interaction between NTP-induced ROS and biomolecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Biological Responses, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Okazaki", "ForeName": "Yasumasa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Biological Responses, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Nanami", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Low-temperature Plasma Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Hiromasa", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1442-0749"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Low-temperature Plasma Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hori", "ForeName": "Masaru", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5757-1109"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Biological Responses, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Low-temperature Plasma Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Toyokuni", "ForeName": "Shinya", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U38V3ZVV3V", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spin Labels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S3Y25PHP1W", "NameOfSubstance": "ferrous chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "55482-03-6", "NameOfSubstance": "2,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxy-1-pyrrolidinyloxy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic N-Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spin Labels"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic N-Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36519277", "10.1080/10715762.2022.2157272"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
