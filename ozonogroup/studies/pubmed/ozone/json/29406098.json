A better understanding of the molecular composition of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in the treated effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is crucial for ensuring the safety of water reuse. In this study, the molecular composition of EfOM in the secondary effluent of a WWTP in Beijing and the reclaimed water further treated with a coagulation-sedimentation-ozonation process were characterized using a non-target Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) method and compared to that of natural organic matter (NOM) in the local source water from a reservoir. It was found that the molecular composition of EfOM in the secondary effluent and reclaimed water was dominated by CHOS formulas, while NOM in the source water was dominated by CHO formulas. The CHO formulas of the three samples had similar origins. Anthropogenic surfactants were responsible for the CHOS formulas in EfOM of the secondary effluent and were not well removed by the coagulation-sedimentation-ozonation treatment process adopted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
