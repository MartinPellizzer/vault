We aimed to evaluate whether prenatal nutrient intake influences the association between air pollutants and autism-related trait scores.", "We included 126 participants from the EARLI (Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation, 2009-2012) cohort, which followed US pregnant mothers who previously had a child with autism. Bayesian kernel machine regression and traditional regression models were used to examine joint associations of prenatal nutrient intake (vitamins D, B12, and B6; folate, choline, and betaine; and total omega 3 and 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, reported via food frequency questionnaire), air pollutant exposure (particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcm [PM<sub>2.5</sub>], nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>], and ozone [O<sub>3</sub>], estimated at the address level), and children's autism-related traits (measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale [SRS] at 36 months).", "Most participants had nutrient intakes and air pollutant exposures that met US standards. Bayesian kernel machine regression mixture models and traditional regression models provided little evidence of individual or joint associations of nutrients and air pollutants with SRS scores or of an association between the overall mixture and SRS scores.", "In this cohort with a high familial likelihood of autism, we did not observe evidence of joint associations between air pollution exposures and nutrient intake with autism-related traits. Future work should examine the use of these methods in larger, more diverse samples, as our results may have been influenced by familial liability and/or relatively high nutrient intakes and low air pollutant exposures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
