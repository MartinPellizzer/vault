The specimens were randomly assigned to one of five groups based on the final irrigant used, with the control group receiving NaOCl+EDTA and the experimental groups receiving MG, FTC, OW, and GTE. The GFP was cemented with a self-etching, dual-cure paste; the bond strength was estimated with a universal testing machine; and failure analysis was conducted with a stereomicroscope.", "The highest PBS was observed in the coronal third of Group 4 (using ozonated water as the final irrigant), whereas the lowest bond integrity was observed in the apical section of Group 2 (1.02-0.54\u00a0MPa) using Malachite green as the final irrigant. Group 1, Group 4, and Group 5 exhibited no significant difference in the bond integrity of GFP to dentin when compared to Group 2 (p>0.05). In addition, comparable bond score values were obtained for Groups 2 and 3 (p>0.05).", "The results of this study suggest that OW and GTE may be effective final disinfectants for root canals, as they increase the bond strength of resin-luting cement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
