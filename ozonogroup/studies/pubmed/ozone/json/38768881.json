To comprehensively quantify the deviations in O<sub>3</sub> formation mechanism by consumed VOCs (C-VOCs), a 5-month field campaign was conducted in a typical industrial city in Northern China over incorporating a 0-D box model (implemented with MCMv3.3.1). The averaged C-VOCs concentration was 6.8\u00a0ppbv during entire period, and Alkenes accounted for 62% dominantly. Without considering C-VOCs, the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) of anthropogenic VOCs (AVOC, overestimated by 68%-75%) and NO<sub>x</sub> (underestimated by 137%-527%) demonstrated deviations at multiple scenarios, and the RIR deviations for precursors in High-O<sub>3</sub>-periods (HOP) were lower than Low-O<sub>3</sub>-periods (LOP). The RIR deviations from individual species involved C-VOCs calculation did not impact the identification for the high-ranking-RIR AVOC species but non-negligible. Monthly comparisons showed that higher C-VOCs concentrations would lead to higher RIR deviations. The daily maximum of net O<sub>x</sub> production rate (P(O<sub>x</sub>)) and the regional transport O<sub>x</sub> (Trans(O<sub>x</sub>)) without C-VOCs were underestimated by 56%-194% and 81%-243%, respectively. After considering C-VOCs, the contribution of HO<sub>2</sub>+NO for O<sub>x</sub> gross production (G(O<sub>x</sub>)) decreased by 7% (LOP) and 7% (HOP), but OH\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub> for O<sub>x</sub> destruction (D(O<sub>x</sub>)) decreased by 16% (LOP) and 23% (HOP), and alkenes\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> increased for D(O<sub>x</sub>) by 12% (LOP) and 22% (HOP). This implies that VOCs-NO<sub>x</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity was deviated between with/without C-VOCs, and severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution rendered deviations in O<sub>3</sub> formation, especially via NO<sub>x</sub>-driving chemistry. Based on RIR(NO<sub>x</sub>)/RIR(AVOC) with/without C-VOCs, the sensitivity regime shifted from VOCs-limited (-0.93) to transition (1.38) at LOP, and from VOCs-limited (0.19) to NO<sub>x</sub>-limited (3.79) at HOP. Our results reflected that the NO<sub>x</sub> limitation degree was underestimated without constraint C-VOCs, especially HOP, and provided implication to more precise O<sub>3</sub> pollution control strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
