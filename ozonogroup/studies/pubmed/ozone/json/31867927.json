The cows were divided into five groups with 10 cows in each. Group 1 was administered an ozone-containing foam preparation via the teat canal into four udder quarters for 5 seconds at the beginning of the dry period; Group 2 was administered ozone at the beginning of the dry period and at the time of delivery; Group 3 was administered ozone at the time of delivery; Group 4 was administered a dry period udder preparation at the beginning of the dry period; and Group 5 was administered only teat seal at the beginning of the dry period. No statistically significant difference was found between the cows with regard to the SCC values at the beginning of the dry period and at the time of delivery (in cows without clinical mastitis, n=25). The SCC values were reported to decrease when the values at the beginning of the dry period and at the time of delivery were compared. All cows except two in Group 1 were detected to have clinical mastitis according to the frequency of microbial isolation in milk at the time of delivery. In conclusion, intra-mammary ozone administration did not prevent mastitis in the dry period or at the time of delivery in herds with contagious mastitis; moreover, it was determined to increase the rate of clinical mastitis in the postpartum period."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Polish Academy of Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop and Animal Production, Akcadag Vocational School, University of Malatya Turgut Ozal, Do\u011fu Quarter, Milli Egemenlik Street, No:42/1, 44600, Ak\u00e7ada\u011f/Malatya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koseman", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zootechny, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Firat, University Quarter, 23200, Elazig, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seker", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Firat, Elazig, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Risvanli", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pol J Vet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101125473", "ISSNLinking": "1505-1773"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Glands, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mastitis, Bovine"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31867927", "10.24425/pjvs.2019.129983"]}}]}
