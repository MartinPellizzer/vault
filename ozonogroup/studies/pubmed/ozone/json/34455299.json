Correspondingly, it is essential to update the emissions and chemical speciation of total organic gases (TOGs), including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), CH<sub>4</sub>, and unidentified non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) for assessing the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In this study, TOG and speciation emissions from 12 in-use light-duty gasoline vehicle (LDGV) exhausts, covering the ESs from China II to China V, were investigated on a chassis dynamometer under the Worldwide Harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC) in China. The results showed that the most effectively controlled subgroup in TOG emissions from LDGVs was VOCs, followed by the unidentified NMHCs and IVOCs. The mass fraction of VOCs in TOGs also reduced from 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09% to 46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018% while the IVOCs gently increased from 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4% to 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% along with the more stringent ESs. For the VOC subsets, the removal efficiency of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) was lower than those of other VOC subsets in the ESs from China IV to V, suggesting the importance of OVOC emission controls for relatively new LDGVs. The IVOC emissions were mainly subject to the ESs, then driving cycles and fuel use. The formation potentials of ozone and SOA from LDGVs decreased separately 96% and 90% along with the restricted ESs from China II-III to China IV. The major contributor of SOA formation transformed from aromatics in the VOC subsets for China II-III vehicles to IVOCs for China IV/V vehicles, highlighting that IVOC emissions from LDGVs are also needed more attentions to control in future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
