Tests were conducted in a 40-L/min pilot plant over a 3-year period. Nonsteady-state mass-transfer analyses for both oxygen and ozone were performed for superficial gas flow rates ranging from 0.13m/min to 0.40m/min. The psi factor, which is the ratio of volumetric mass-transfer coefficients of ozone to oxygen, was determined. The decrease in oxygen transfer rate caused by contaminants in reclaimed water was only 10 to 15% compared to tap water. A simple mathematical model was developed to describe transfer rate and steady state ozone concentration. Ozone decay was modeled accurately as a pseudo first-order reaction between ozone and ozone-demanding materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1593, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Pan", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hsiao-Ting", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Babcock", "ForeName": "Roger W", "Initials": "RW", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stenstrom", "ForeName": "Michael K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19280900", "10.2175/106143008x325782"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
