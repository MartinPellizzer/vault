However, the unclear relationship between BVOCs and air pollutants in the under-canopy space limits the accuracy of air pollution control and the exploitation of forest healthcare functions. To clarify the variation of BVOCs in forest therapy bases, and their impacts on ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) at nose height, total VOCs (TVOCs) in the forest were collected during typical sunny days, while air pollutants and meteorological factors were observed simultaneously. The results showed that the branch-level emissions of P. tabuliformis were dominated by healthcare-effective monoterpenoids, with only \u03b1-pinene having relative air concentrations of over 5\u00a0% in forest air samples. The correlation between concentrations of under-canopy TVOCs and emission rates of BVOCs from P. tabuliformis was weak (p\u00a0>\u00a00.09) in all seasons. However, the correlation between concentrations of TVOCs and the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> showed clear seasonal differences. In spring, TVOCs only showed a significant negative correlation with PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the forest (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In summer and autumn, TVOCs were significantly negatively correlated with both O<sub>3</sub> (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Specifically, the negative linear relationships were more pronounced for O<sub>3</sub> and oxygenated VOCs in autumn (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.40, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than for other relationships. The relationship between air pollutant concentrations inside and outside the forest also showed significant seasonal differences, generally characterized by a weaker correlation between them during seasons of strong emissions. Therefore, BVOCs in coniferous forests are health functions as they can provide healthcare effects and mitigate the concentration of air pollutants in the forest, and the establishment of forest therapy bases in rural areas with low NO<sub>x</sub> can be a sensible approach to promote good health, well-being, and sustainable development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
