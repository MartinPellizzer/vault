Yet few studies dig into the relationship between air pollution and airborne infectious diseases.", "Daily data on influenza incidence were obtained from Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC). Data on air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and PM with aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) were retrieved from ten national air sampling stations located at Wuhan. We applied generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the associations between air pollution and the risk of influenza in Wuhan, China during 2015-2017.", "In the single-day lag model, the largest effect estimates were observed at lag 0. An increased relative risk (RR) of influenza was significantly associated with a 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in SO<sub>2</sub> (RR: 1.099; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011-1.195), NO<sub>2</sub> (RR: 1.039; 95% CI: 1.013-1.065), and O<sub>3</sub> (RR: 1.005; 95% CI: 0.994-1.016), respectively. In the multi-day lag model, concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> were statistically significantly associated with the risk of influenza at lag 0-1. The seasonal analysis suggests that the influence of air pollution on influenza is greater in the cold season as compared in the warm season in the early lag days. The multi-pollutant model indicates that NO<sub>2</sub> may be a potential confounder for co-pollutants.", "Our study shows that air pollution may be associated with the risk of influenza in a broad sense. Therefore, when formulating policies to deal with influenza outbreaks in the future, factors regarding air pollution should be taken into consideration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
