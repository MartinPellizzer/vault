It is a recently discovered plant master regulator which has a crucial role under abiotic stress conditions (salinity, drought, heat, cold, alkalinity, acid rain, ozone, and metals stress). In the solanaceous family, the tomato is highly sensitive to abiotic stresses that affect its growth and development, ultimately hampering production and productivity. Melatonin acts as a strong antioxidant, bio-stimulator, and growth regulator, facilitating photosynthesis, delaying leaf senescence, and increasing the antioxidant enzymes system through direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under abiotic stresses. In addition, melatonin also boosts morphological traits such as vegetative growth, leaf photosynthesis, root architecture system, mineral nutrient elements, and antioxidant activities in tomato plants, confirming their tolerances against salinity, drought, heat, cold, alkalinity, acid rain, chemical, pathogen, and metals stress. In this review, an attempt has been made to summarize the potential role of melatonin for tomato plant endurance towards abiotic stresses, along with the known relationship between the two."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
