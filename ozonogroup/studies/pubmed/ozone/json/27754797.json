The aim of this study was to determine whether an association between short-term air pollution exposure and outpatient visits for enteritis in Xi'an, China, occurred using a time-series investigation. Daily baseline data from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, were obtained. The overdispersed Poisson generalized additive model was used to analyze the association between air pollutant levels and frequency of enteritis. A total of 12,815 outpatient hospital visits for enteritis were identified. A 10-\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in average concentrations of particulate matter (PM)<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and a 0.1-mg/m<sup>3</sup> rise of carbon monoxide (CO) were associated with a significantly elevated number of outpatient visits for enteritis on concurrent days, while ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) did not markedly affect the frequency of enteritis clinical visits. There were no significant positive effects between two-pollutant and single-pollutant models. Lag models showed that the most prominent responses occurred on concurrent days. Confounding factors of gender and age played a significant role in the observations. Taken together, data indicate that air pollution may result in enhanced occurrence of enteritis attack."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Epidemiology, College of Preventive Medicine , Third Military Medical University , Chongqing , China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Kan", "ForeName": "Hai-Dong", "Initials": "HD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Information Department Medical Record Room, Second Affiliated Hospital , Fourth Military Medical University , Xi'an , China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Yan-Ni", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ren-Jie", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , USA."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiang-Hong", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Epidemiology, College of Preventive Medicine , Third Military Medical University , Chongqing , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ya-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Epidemiology, College of Preventive Medicine , Third Military Medical University , Chongqing , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e School of Public Health, Fourth Military Medical University , Xi'an , China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Ai-Ling", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Epidemiology, College of Preventive Medicine , Third Military Medical University , Chongqing , China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Tong-Jian", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Enteritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27754797", "10.1080/15287394.2016.1227006"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
