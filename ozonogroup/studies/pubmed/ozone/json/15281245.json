Guinea pigs were placed outdoors on the roof of our facility, 8 hours daily, from February to May 1995. At the same time, control guinea pigs were kept indoors breathing filtered air. Air pollutants, temperature, and humidity data were obtained from the nearest station of the Environmental Monitoring Net. The airways and lung parenchyma were analyzed after 120 days using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). During the 4-month exposure period, ozone (O3) exceeded the norm during 511 hours, and suspended particles less than 10 microm in diameter (PM10) during 52 hours. Both pollutants reached peak levels of more than twice the norm. TEM revealed no important abnormalities in the control group. In the exposed group, there was loss of cilia, detachment of epithelial cells, and eosinophil and macrophage migration toward alveolar spaces through type I pneumocytes with destruction of their basal membranes. In six guinea pigs in the exposed group, we noted bacteria along the airways, with associated inflammatory response. We explain the colonization of the respiratory epithelium by bacteria as the result of the impairment on the defense mechanism caused by the exposure to environmental O3 and PM10."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Perinatology, Mexico City, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Villegas-Castrejon", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Villalba-Caloca", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meneses-Flores", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haselbarth-Lopez", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flores-Rivera", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perez-Neria", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cilia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15281245"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
