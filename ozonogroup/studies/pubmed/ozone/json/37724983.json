Nonchemical treatments such as cold plasma offer potential solutions to antibiotic resistance. We investigated the use of laser-induced graphene as an inexpensive, lightweight, and portable electrode for generating cold plasma. At the same time, the mechanism or molecular mediators of cold plasma-induced antibacterial activity remain poorly understood. This study validates graphene as an efficient structure for producing therapeutic cold plasma, and this study also indicates that ozone is the primary mediator of antibacterial activity in graphene-mediated cold plasmas for bacterial growth under the conditions studied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Larkin", "ForeName": "James O", "Initials": "JO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Mozden", "ForeName": "Sarah C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Chyan", "ForeName": "Yieu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Qingxin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rice Nexus, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Cherukuri", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8479-9328"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Smalley-Curl Institute and the NanoCarbon Center, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Tour", "ForeName": "James M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8681-0789"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Ball", "ForeName": "Zachary T", "Initials": "ZT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37724983", "10.1021/acsami.3c09216"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
