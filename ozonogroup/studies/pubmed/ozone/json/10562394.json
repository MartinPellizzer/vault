Concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA) were determined in needles of healthy and declining trees in a massif with a declining forest and in a massif with a healthier forest. In addition, ABA was quantified in needles of trees exposed to either charcoal-filtered air or unfiltered air supplemented with ozone in open-top chambers located at the Col du Donon. The concentration of ABA in needles of injured trees increased when the trees were exposed to ozone either under field conditions or in open-top chambers; however, the difference in ABA concentration between control and ozone-exposed needles was less in the open-top chambers, where ozone was the sole variable, than in the field. The results are discussed in the context of the effects of ozone on plant water relations and hormone-mediated cell defense."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physiologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, 06108 Nice Cedex 2, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bianco", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalstein", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10562394", "10.1093/treephys/19.12.787"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
