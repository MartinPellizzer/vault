However, the impacts of decreasing fine particulates (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) on summer ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation still remain disputable. We perform simulations in the 2018 summer over the YRD using the WRF-Chem model that considers the aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and HO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous loss on aerosol surface. The model reasonably reproduces the measured spatiotemporal surface O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and aerosol compositions. Model sensitivity experiments show that the NOx mitigation during recent years changes daytime O<sub>3</sub> formation in summer from the transition regime to the NOx-sensitive regime in the YRD. The decreasing NOx emission generally weakens O<sub>3</sub> formation and lowers ambient O<sub>3</sub> levels in summer during recent years, except for some urban centers of megacities. While, the haze alleviation characterized by a decline in ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in the past years largely counteracts the daytime O<sub>3</sub> decrease caused by NOx mitigation, largely contributing to the persistently high levels of summertime O<sub>3</sub>. The counteracting effect is dominantly attributed to the attenuated ARF and minorly contributed by the suppressed HO<sub>2</sub> uptake and heterogeneous loss on aerosol surface. These results highlight that the repeated O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the YRD is closely associated with NOx and haze alleviation and more efforts must be taken to achieve lower O<sub>3</sub> levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
