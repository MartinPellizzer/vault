Still H(2)O(2) alone is not effective for high concentrations of certain refractory contaminants because of low rates of reaction at reasonable H(2)O(2) concentrations. Improvements can be achieved by using transition metal salts (e.g. iron salts) or ozone and UV-light can activate H(2)O(2) to form hydroxyl radicals, which are strong oxidants. Oxidation processes utilising activation of H(2)O(2) by iron salts, classically referred to as Fenton's reagent is known to be very effective in the destruction of many hazardous organic pollutants in water. The first part of our paper presents a literature review of the various Fenton reagent reactions which constitute the overall kinetic scheme with all possible side reactions. It also summarises previous publications on the relationships between the dominant parameters (e.g. [H(2)O(2)], [Fe(2+)], . . .). The second part of our review discusses the possibility of improving sludge dewaterability using Fenton's reagent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, de Croylaan 46, 3001 Heverlee, Belgium. elisabeth.neyens@cit.kuleuven.ac.be"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neyens", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baeyens", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}], "NumberOfReferences": "34"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12628776", "10.1016/s0304-3894(02)00282-0", "S0304389402002820"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
