In this study, we first characterized the temporal trends of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> for Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan respectively during 2018-2020. The annual mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> has decreased by 7.82%-33.92%, while O<sub>3</sub> concentration showed insignificant variations by -6.77%-4.65% during 2018-2020. The generalized additive models (GAMs) were implemented to quantify the contribution of individual meteorological factors and their gas precursors on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. On a short-term perspective, GAMs modeling shows that the daily variability of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration is largely related to the variation of precursor gases (R\u00a0=\u00a00.67-0.90), while meteorological conditions mainly affect the daily variability of O<sub>3</sub> concentration (R\u00a0=\u00a00.65-0.80) during 2018-2020. The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were also quantified by using GAMs. During the 2020 lockdown, PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased significantly for these megacities, yet the ozone concentration showed an increasing trend compared to 2019. The GAMs analysis indicated that the contribution of precursor gases to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> changes is 3-8 times higher than that of meteorological factors. In general, GAMs modeling on air quality is helpful to the understanding and control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
