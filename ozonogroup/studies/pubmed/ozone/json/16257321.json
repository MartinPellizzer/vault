EDTA extraction (40 mmol kg(-1)) removed from 27.4+/-1.5% to 64.8+/-1.5% of Pb, and from 1.9+/-0.2% to 22.4+/-2.0% of Zn from tested soils, and significantly reduced soil Pb bioavailability (PBET) and mobility (TCLP). Pretreatment of tested soils with ozone before EDTA extraction enhanced EDTA extractability of Pb for 11.0 to 28.9%, but had no effect on the extractability of Zn. In most of the soils, ozonation had no statistically significant effect on bioavailability and mobility of Pb, residual after EDTA extraction. Using linear regression analysis we found a significant increase (p<0.01) in EDTA extractability of Pb after soil ozonation in soils with a higher initial Pb content. EDTA extractability of Pb after soil ozonation was also significantly higher for soils with a lower Pb extractability when treated with EDTA alone. We found no correlation between soil organic matter content and the percentage of the Pb fraction bound to soil organic matter (where from 25.6+/-1.3% to 73.2+/-0.6% of Pb reside in tested soils) and Pb extractability with EDTA after soil ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Jamnikarjeva 101, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia. domen.lestan@bf.uni-lj.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lestan", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hanc", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finzgar", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G34HU7RV0", "NameOfSubstance": "Edetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Slovenia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16257321", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.03.005", "S0045-6535(05)00395-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
