Merr.]. To ensure soybean productivity in areas of rising O<sub>3</sub>, it is important to identify tolerant genotypes. This work describes the response of the high-yielding soybean cultivar 'Jake' to elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. 'Jake' was treated with either low O<sub>3</sub> [charcoal-filtered (CF) air, 12\u202fh mean: 20\u202fppb] or with O<sub>3</sub>-enriched air (12\u202fh mean: 87\u202fppb) over the course of the entire growing season. In contrast to the absence of O<sub>3</sub>-induced leaf injury under low O<sub>3</sub>, elevated O<sub>3</sub> caused severe leaf injury and decreased stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. Although elevated O<sub>3</sub> reduced total leaf area, leaf number, and plant height at different developmental stages, above-ground and root biomass remained unchanged. Analyzing carbon and nitrogen content, we found that elevated O<sub>3</sub> altered allocation of both elements, which ultimately led to a 15 % yield loss by decreasing seed size but not seed number. We concluded that cultivar 'Jake' possesses developmental strength to tolerate chronic O<sub>3</sub> conditions, attributes that make it suitable breeding material for the generation of new O<sub>3</sub> tolerant lines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Plant Science Research Unit, Raleigh, 27607 NC, USA; Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, 27695 NC, USA.
