While \"conventional surfactants\" are degraded to a great extent in the biological wastewater treatment process, partly or perfluorinated surfactants are not only stable against biodegradation but also against oxidizing agents, they even resist OH-radical attacks. Our objectives were to eliminate the fluorinated surfactants perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) by adsorption, separation or degradation with a balance of precursor compounds and follow-up of degradation products. Therefore, municipal wastewater was spiked with these fluorinated surfactants before membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment-applying microfiltration membranes--was performed and before permeates were treated using ozone (O3) or different advanced oxidation treatment (AOP) techniques. O3 or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), both in combination with UV radiation or in combination with catalysts, was applied. Removal by adsorption or membrane separation as well as degradation were monitored by substance specific determination and identification. High resolution mass spectrometry after high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/HRMS and -MS(n)) was used for analysis. Contact to Teflon and/or glass during all analytical procedures was avoided."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany. schroeder@isa.rwth-aachen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schr\u00f6der", "ForeName": "H F R", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jos\u00e9", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gebhardt", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "R F P M", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinnekamp", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanesulfonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9H2MAI21CL", "NameOfSubstance": "perfluorooctane sulfonic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanesulfonic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20555218", "10.2166/wst.2010.917"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
