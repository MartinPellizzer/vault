We examined the association between air pollutants and recurrent cardiovascular events in STEMI survivors.", "A retrospective cohort of 1641 discharged patients after STEMI was established in 2013 and followed until the end of 2019. Concentrations of air pollutants including fine particles <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), inhalable particles <10\u00a0\u03bcm aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) measured by fixed ambient air monitoring stations were collected for exposure assessment. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the increased risks of recurrent cardiovascular events.", "Compared with the first exposure quartile, for short-term exposure, hazard ratios (HRs) of recurrent cardiovascular events associated with the fourth exposure quartiles of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub> were 4.06 (95% CI: 2.62-6.30), 3.79 (95% CI: 2.57-5.58), 2.22 (95% CI: 1.67-2.94), 4.47 (95% CI: 3.08-6.48), 3.73 (95% CI: 2.54-5.48), and 5.35 (95% CI: 3.12-9.20), respectively. For long-term exposure, HRs associated with the fourth exposure quartiles of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub> were 6.43 (95% CI: 3.60-11.47), 4.77 (95% CI: 2.85-7.99), 3.22 (95% CI: 2.00-5.19), 3.20 (95% CI: 2.05-5.01), 4.44 (95% CI: 2.65-7.45), and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.80-1.42), respectively. The risks of recurrent cardiovascular events brought by air pollutants mostly increased nonlinearly.", "Short- and long-term exposure to air pollutants except ozone increases the risks of recurrent cardiovascular events in STEMI survivors.
