However, the efficiency of various wastewater treatment processes to remove estrogenic activity in effluents and the association with organic micropollutants was not well known. We evaluated the estrogenic activity using a well-characterized in vivo bioassay featuring the Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) and analyzed 886 semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in effluents from four secondary wastewater treatment plants (SWTP A-D) and a tertiary wastewater treatment plant (TTP E) that utilized various common treatment processes in northern China. The final effluents from SWTPs and TTP E all exhibited estrogenic effects, increasing male fish plasma vitellogenin (VTG) contents and estradiol/testosterone (E<sub>2</sub>/T) ratios. Key regulating genes in the male fish liver including vtg1, vtg3, era, er\u03b2, and cyp19a were upregulated. TTP E demonstrated high performance in reducing estrogenic activity in the effluents, with a reduction of 64% in integrative biomarkers of estrogenic response (IBR). UV disinfection at SWTPs removed IBR by 14%-\u00a033%, while ozone disinfection at TTP E did not reduce IBR. Several SVOCs including alkanes, chlorobenzenes, and phthalates, detected at ng/L to \u00b5g/L level, significantly correlated with effluent estrogenic activity. Our findings suggest the necessity and the potential means to improve the efficiency of current wastewater treatment approaches to achieve better protection for aquatic organisms against the joint effects of mixtures of various categories of micropollutants in effluents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
