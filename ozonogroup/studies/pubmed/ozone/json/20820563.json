In particular, we successfully developed a simple QLS process for fabricating ordered multilayers with a good thickness control. The films prepared from three different methods were characterized by a wide range of methods including electronic absorption spectra, IR, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and current-voltage (I-V) measurements. J-type aggregates have been formed with the increasing degree of order of molecular stacking Cast < QLS < SA films. Moreover, the gas sensing behavior of the three types of films was investigated towards ozone in the 8-300 ppb range. Unexpectedly good sensitive, stable and reproducible responses to O(3) gas are obtained for these kinds of ultra-thin solution processed films in a fast response/recovery cycle of only 1/4 min. The response of Eu(2)[Pc(15C5)(4)](2)[Pc(OC(10)H(21))(8)] films is linearly correlated to the ozone concentration. The interaction between the Eu(2)[Pc(15C5)(4)](2)[Pc(OC(10)H(21))(8)] films and different ozone concentrations was found to follow first-order kinetics. Strikingly, QLS films showed the most stable response and the largest average sensor response rate constant among the three types of films."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Chimie Mol\u00e9culaire de l'Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, CNRS UMR 5260, University of Bourgogne, 21078 Dijon, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yanli", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bouvet", "ForeName": "Marcel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sizun", "ForeName": "Thibaut", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yingning", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plassard", "ForeName": "Cedric", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lesniewska", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jianzhuang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20820563", "10.1039/c0cp00381f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
