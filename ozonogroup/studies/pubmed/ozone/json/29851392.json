The batch experiments were run with variations in specific ozone dose (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide-to-ozone (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>) ratio. Based on the removal by ozonation and peroxone, micropollutants were categorized into three groups: non-reactive compounds (i.e. amidotrizoate), moderately reactive compounds (i.e. metoprolol, acesulfame potassium, bezafibrate, and benzotriazole), and highly reactive compounds (i.e. carbamazepine and diclofenac). For ozonation and peroxone process, the removals for highly reactive compounds and moderately reactive compounds were 82-99% and 29-99%, respectively. The removal of amidotrizoate was not observed in this study. The effect of ozonation on micropollutant removals was similar to the peroxone process. However, differences in bromate formation were observed. Bromate formation depended on the SOD, while addition of hydrogen peroxide suppressed the bromate formation. The peroxone process at the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> ratio of 0.3 was recommended to bromide-containing water below 100 \u00b5g\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> for simultaneous control of micropollutants and bromate. Enhancement in micropollutant removals, except for the non-reactive groups, was achieved with either higher SOD or the addition of hydrogen peroxide to ozonation. The micropollutant removal predicted from the second-order kinetic reaction with ozone and \u2022OH exposures was higher than the observed data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailandand Research Program in Control of Hazardous Contaminants in Raw Water Resources for Water Scarcity Resilience, Center of Excellence on Hazardous Substance Management (HSM), Thailand E-mail: songkeart.pha@kmutt.ac.th."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phattarapattamawong", "ForeName": "Songkeart", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaiser", "ForeName": "Andreas Marius", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saracevic", "ForeName": "Ernis", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schaar", "ForeName": "Heidemarie Paula", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krampe", "ForeName": "J\u00f6rg", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HL6A2XXU5D", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium peroxymonosulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29851392", "10.2166/wst.2018.170"]}}]}
