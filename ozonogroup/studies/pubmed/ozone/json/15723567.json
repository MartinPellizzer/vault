In this work, we have studied the UV photolysis of O3 in the presence of Cl2 at room temperature, which presents two catalytic cycles of O3 depletion with efficiencies dependent on the partial pressures in the photoreactor. The ozone dissociation was initiated with fourth harmonic pulses of a Nd:YAG laser. The detection of the reactants and the final and intermediate reaction products was performed with real-time mass spectrometry. The variations of the O3, Cl2 and ClO concentration were measured. The equations system associated to a proposed kinetic scheme was solved numerically and excellent agreement with the experimental results was obtained. The results from this work allowed the determination of the wall loss rates of the O(1D), Cl and ClO radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaciones en L\u00e1seres y Aplicaciones, Juan Bautista de la Salle 4397 (B1603ALO) Villa Martelli, Buenos Aires, Argentina. jcodnia@citefa.gov.ar"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Codnia", "ForeName": "Jorge", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manzano", "ForeName": "Francisco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azc\u00e1rate", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda Laura", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15723567", "10.1562/2004-12-06-RA-395", "2004-12-06-RA-395"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
