Kinetics was followed with a continuous-flow reactor previously validated by studying the fast reaction between chlorine and ammonia. The overall reaction rate between bromine and phenols is controlled by the reaction of HOBr with the phenoxide ion between pH 6 and pH 10. The reaction of HOBr with the undissociated phenols and the reaction of BrO(-) with the phenoxide ions become only significant for pH<6 and pH>10, respectively. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of HOBr with phenoxide ions vary between 1.4(+/-0.1)x10(3) and 2.1(+/-0.5)x10(8)M(-1)s(-1) for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and 4-methylphenol, respectively. Hammett-type correlation was obtained for the reaction of HOBr with the phenoxide ions (log(k)=8.0-3.33 x Sigmasigma) and was compared with Hammett-type correlations of HOCl and HOI. The reaction rate of bromine with phenol-like organic compounds was estimated to be about 10(3)-fold higher than with chlorine and 10(3)-fold lower than with ozone in drinking water treatment conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Chimie de l'Eau et de l'Environnement, UMR CNRS 6008, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Poitiers 40, Avenue du Recteur Pineau, Poitiers Cedex 86 022, France. herve.gallard@esip.univ-poitiers.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallard", "ForeName": "Herv\u00e9", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pellizzari", "ForeName": "Fabien", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crou\u00e9", "ForeName": "Jean Philippe", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Legube", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Movements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12767291", "10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00132-5", "S0043-1354(03)00132-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
