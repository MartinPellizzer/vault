Here we report on the design, construction, testing, operation and maintenance of a newly developed <i>in vivo</i> rodent ozone inhalation exposure system. <b>Materials and methods:</b> Key design requirements for the system included large-capacity exposure chambers to facilitate studies with large sample sizes, automatic and precise control of chamber ozone concentrations, as well as automated data collection on airflow and environmental conditions. The exposure system contains two Hazelton H-1000 stainless steel and glass exposure chambers, each providing capacity for up to 180 mice or 96 rats. We developed an empirically tuned proportional-integral-derivative control loop that provides stable ozone concentrations throughout the exposure period (typically 3h), after a short ramp time (\u223c8\u2009min), and across a tested concentration range of 0.2-2\u2009ppm. Specific details on the combination of analog and digital input/output system for environmental data acquisition, control and safety systems are provided, and we outline the steps involved in maintenance and calibration of the system. <b>Results:</b> We show that the exposure system produces consistent ozone exposures both within and across experiments, as evidenced by low coefficients of variation in chamber ozone concentration and consistent biological responses (airway inflammation) in mice, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> Thus, we have created a large and robust ozone exposure system, facilitating future studies on the health effects of ozone in rodents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Genetics , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Curriculum in Toxicology & Environmental Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5305-0445"], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Gregory J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c United States Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walsh", "ForeName": "Leon", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c United States Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higuchi", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Genetics , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Curriculum in Toxicology & Environmental Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelada", "ForeName": "Samir N P", "Initials": "SNP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES010126", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 ES024965", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T32 ES007126", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}], "CoiStatement": "Disclosure statement.
