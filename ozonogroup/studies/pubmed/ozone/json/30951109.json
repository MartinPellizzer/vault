The use of these residues as amendments at large-scale mine tailings storage facilities for in situ plant-based reclamation may be a useful alternative. We performed a greenhouse assay to evaluate effectiveness of pig slurries and the solid organic fraction of aerobic-aerated pig slurries, both treated and not treated for odor emission, as amendments for copper tailings. Different doses of slurries or the solid organic fraction of the slurries, untreated and treated with either ozone or a commercial product used to manage strong odors (Just a Drop), were incorporated into tailings and stabilized (15 d) under greenhouse conditions. L. (ryegrass) was used as bioindicator for Cu and Zn toxicity. Plant performance (shoot and root dry biomass, Cu and Zn content in leaves) and general physicochemical characteristics of substrates were evaluated. Our results showed that odor management of pig residues was possible with commercial products, and their incorporation into tailings rapidly and effectively reduced odor emission. The solid organic fraction of the slurries neutralized acidic tailings, and both pig residues increased organic matter and nutrient content in tailings while reducing extractable Cu. As a result, ryegrass productivity was significantly improved by incorporation of either slurries or their solid organic fraction into tailings in a dose-dependent form. Foliar Cu content in ryegrass was not affected but foliar Zn content increased; however, Zn remained within acceptable ranges. Both the pig slurries and their soil organic fractions proved to be valuable residues for tailings reclamation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gandarillas", "ForeName": "M\u00f3nica", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Espa\u00f1a", "ForeName": "Helena", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gardeweg", "ForeName": "Rosario", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bas", "ForeName": "Fernando", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arellano", "ForeName": "Eduardo C", "Initials": "EC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Sally", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ginocchio", "ForeName": "Rosanna", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Qual", "NlmUniqueID": "0330666", "ISSNLinking": "0047-2425"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mining"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30951109", "10.2134/jeq2017.11.0431"]}}]}
