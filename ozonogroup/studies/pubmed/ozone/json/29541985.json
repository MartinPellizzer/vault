It is based on the in situ measurements carried out during 1973-1975, 1983-1985, 1997-1998 and 2004-2014 at the tropical coastal station, Thiruvananthapuram. From 1973 to 1997, surface O<sub>3</sub> shows a slow increase of ~\u20090.1\u00a0ppb\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> and a faster increase of 0.4\u00a0ppb\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> afterwards till 2009 after which it showed a levelling off till 2012 followed by a minor decrease. The highest rate of increase is observed during 2005 to 2009 (2\u00a0ppb\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup>), and the overall increase from 1973 to 2012 is ~\u200910\u00a0ppb. The increase in day time O<sub>3</sub> (peak O<sub>3</sub>) is estimated as 0.42\u00a0ppb\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> during 1997-2012 and 2.93\u00a0ppb\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> during 2006-2012. Interestingly, the long-term trend in O<sub>3</sub> showed seasonal dependence which is more pronounced during O<sub>3</sub> peaking seasons (winter/summer). The observed trends were analysed in the light of the changes in NO<sub>2</sub>, a major outcome of anthropogenic activities and methane which has both natural and anthropogenic sources and also meteorological parameters. Surface O<sub>3</sub> and NO <sub>x</sub> exhibited positive association, but with varying rate of increase of O<sub>3</sub> for NO <sub>x</sub> <\u20094 and >\u20094\u00a0ppb. Methane, a precursor of O<sub>3</sub> also showed increase in tune with O<sub>3</sub>. Unlike many other high-latitude locations, meteorology plays a significant role in the long-term trends in O<sub>3</sub> at this tropical site with water vapour abundance and strong solar irradiance which favour photochemistry. A comparison with the corresponding changes in the satellite-retrieved tropospheric column O<sub>3</sub> (TCO) also showed an increase of 0.03\u00a0DU\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> during 1996-2005 which enhanced to 0.12\u00a0DU\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> after 2005. Both surface O<sub>3</sub> and satellite-retrieved TCO were positively correlated with daily maximum temperature, increasing at the rate of 1.54\u00a0ppb\u00a0\u00b0C<sup>-1</sup> and 1.9\u00a0DU\u00a0\u00b0C<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, on yearly basis. Surface O<sub>3</sub> is found to be negatively correlated with water vapour content (\u03c1<sub>v</sub>) at this tropical site, but at higher levels of \u03c1<sub>v</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> shows a positive trend."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Space Physics Laboratory, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695 022, India. prabha_nair@vssc.gov.in."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Prabha R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Space Physics Laboratory, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695 022, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ajayakumar", "ForeName": "Revathy S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Colorado State University, Boulder, CO, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "David", "ForeName": "Liji Mary", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Space Physics Laboratory, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695 022, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Girach", "ForeName": "Imran A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Space Physics Laboratory, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, 695 022, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mottungan", "ForeName": "Kavitha", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Nov 23;96(24):13626-33", "ArticleIdList": ["10570123"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2002 Nov 1;299(1-3):97-113", "ArticleIdList": ["12462577"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Monit. 2012 Apr;14(4):1159-66", "ArticleIdList": ["22354409"]}, {"Citation": "Glob Chang Biol. 2015 Feb 3;:null", "ArticleIdList": ["25652911"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2016 Jul;214:589-599", "ArticleIdList": ["27131819"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29541985", "10.1007/s11356-018-1695-x", "10.1007/s11356-018-1695-x"]}}]}
