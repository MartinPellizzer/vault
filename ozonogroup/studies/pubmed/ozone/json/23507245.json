Characterization and assessment of the annular falling film reactor for handling different advanced oxidation methods was performed. Degussa P-25 TiO2 particles were immobilized on borosilicate glass (BSG) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) tubes and used as a photocatalyst in this study. The characteristics of the falling film reactor, such as the thickness and distribution of falling films and the level of gas absorption into the liquid falling films, as well as the effect of UVA irradiation on the decomposition of ozone inside the falling film reactor, were studied. The adsorption of a model compound on the surface of the immobilized catalyst was measured and the photoactivity of the immobilized photocatalyst was evaluated for the degradation of the model compound. Oxalic acid was chosen as the model compound in this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
