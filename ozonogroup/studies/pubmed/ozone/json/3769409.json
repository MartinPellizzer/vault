On 1 day, airway responsiveness was assessed with dose-response curves of acetylcholine aerosol versus pulmonary resistance. On a second day, five dogs were exposed to ozone (3.0 p.p.m. for 2 h) and five were exposed to filtered air. Then airway responsiveness to acetylcholine was reassessed. All dogs were then killed, the trachea was rapidly removed and strips of smooth muscle were prepared from the central one-third of the trachea. The responsiveness of each strip to electrical field stimulation (contractions inhibitable by atropine and tetrodotoxin) and exogenous acetylcholine was assessed after 2 and 6 h of incubation and washing. Ozone caused a marked increase in responsiveness in vivo to acetylcholine with a fall in mean provocation concentration from 0.15 g % to 0.026 g % (P less than 0.001) while sham exposure had no effect. The responsiveness of muscle strips to electrical field stimulation in ozone-exposed dogs after 2 h of incubation and washing was increased when compared with 6 h of incubation and washing and with the control dogs (P less than 0.05 for EF50, the frequency of stimulation giving 50% maximum contraction). However, responsiveness to exogenous acetylcholine was similar in all strips from both ozone-exposed and control dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walters", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Byrne", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graf", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabbri", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nadel", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-24136", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Sci (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "7905731", "ISSNLinking": "0143-5221"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3769409", "10.1042/cs0710605"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
