It has a strong absorption in the microwave, terahertz and far-infrared spectral ranges where a large part of the Earth's outgoing longwave radiation to space is located. In this work, the observations, and analyses of the ozone high-resolution spectra in the THz range recorded using the Synchrotron light source of the SOLEIL CNRS equipment are reported for the first time. Thanks to the exceptional brightness of the Synchrotron radiation and to the signal/noise ratio, it was possible to observe many more ozone transitions of the cold rotational band and the hot \u03bd<sub>2</sub>-\u03bd<sub>2</sub> band in the range 0.9-6 THz compared to the previous works. In addition, we have carried out new measurements and assignments for the \u03bd<sub>2</sub> band. The simultaneous fit of the rotational band GS-GS, the hot band \u03bd<sub>2</sub>-\u03bd<sub>2</sub> and the FIR \u03bd<sub>2</sub> band yielded an overall weighted standard deviation of 0.68 for 13,466 line positions within the experimental accuracy. This includes all previously available MW (with the best uncertainty 0.1 - 10\u00a0kHz), FIR data and the original SOLEIL measurements that provided experimental accuracy of 0.00005 - 0.0001\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> for the best lines. Significant deviations in new experimental spectra compared to available spectroscopic databases were evidenced, particularly for the line positions and energy levels at high J, K<sub>a</sub> rotational quantum numbers that are the most pronounced in the 4.5 - 6 THz range. Accurate ab initio calculations of line intensities combined with empirically fitted line positions were used to create new linelists that permit theoretical modelling of the transmittance in a good agreement with the Synchrotron spectra in the entire range of observations for various pressures and optical paths. The region near 100\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> and above appears to be more sensitive to the temperature conditions that should be considered in atmospheric observation for the currently operational and future ground based and space missions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
