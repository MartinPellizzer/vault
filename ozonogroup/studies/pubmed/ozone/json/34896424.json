Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by photocatalyst have garnered great attention as a new frontier promising eco-friendly and sustainable wastewater treatment technology. Utilization of the photocatalytic technology efficiently is significant for cleaner environment. Bismuth based photocatalyst have aroused widespread attention as a visible light responsive photocatalyst for waste water treatment due to their non-toxicity, low cost, modifiable morphology, and outstanding optical and chemical properties. In this review, we have dealt with the research progress on bismuth-based photocatalysts for waste water treatment. However, it seems to give limitation over pristine photocatalysts such as slow migration of charge carriers, charge carrier recombination, low visible light absorption, etc., Various bismuth based photocatalyst and its modifications via doping, heterojunction, Z-scheme etc., are discussed in detail. Further, the strategies adopted to improve the photocatalytic activity of bismuth based photocatalyst to improve the waste water treatment (mostly drugs and dyes) are critically reviewed. Also, we have discussed the bacterial inactivation by bismuth based photocatalyst. Finally, the challenges and future aspects against bismuth based photocatalyst are explored for further research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
