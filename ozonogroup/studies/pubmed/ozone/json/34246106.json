Ozone is a highly reactive gas that enters in plants through stomata and initiates the overproduction of ROS which causes oxidative stress in plants that lead to the destruction of membranal lipids, proteins, impaired the production of sugars and other metabolites and ultimately damage the cell. Presented study was conducted to assess the ozone toxicity on the biomass accumulation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars and the role of antioxidative activity in intraspecific sensitivity among the tested cultivars. Results showed that the ozone exposed plants have higher accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA correspond to the EDU supplementation which increase the membrane permeability and adversely influence the protein, starch, and biomass accumulation and allocation of the experimental cotton cultivars. On the basis of biomass reduction, cotton cultivar ADC1 is the most sensitive cultivar, while cultivars G. Cot.21\u00a0>\u00a0GADC-2 and G. Cot.13 is moderately sensitive and cultivar V-797 is the least sensitive to ozone stress. Activated defense mechanism such as enhanced activity of antioxidative compounds and enzymes detoxify the ROS by scavenging H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and protects plants against damage. However, activation of defence is variable among the cultivars and corresponded to the biomass loss. Study concluded that the ozone sensitivity among the cotton cultivars depends on the scavenging of ROS. Further, study recommended cultivar ADC-1 as an assessment tool for ozone and cultivar V-797 for cultivation at ozone prone areas to minimize the agricultural loss."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
