Inhibition was more pronounced for the first 5 min of ozone exposure in the directly ozone exposed membranes than in the membranes prepared from ozone exposed erythrocytes. However, Na(+)-K+ ATPase activities of both preparations were inhibited to the same extent (about 70%) at the end of 10 min ozone exposure. It was also determined that there was a close relationship between the decrease of enzyme activity and the increase in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in both types of preparations. Na(+)-K+ ATPase was inhibited by ozone even at the presence of vitamin E or vitamin C. However, the degree of the inhibitions and the amounts of thiobarbituric acid reactive products formed were smaller than the corresponding values found in the absence of these vitamins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Cukurova, Art & Science Faculty, Department of Chemistry, Adana-Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "T\u00fckel", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bilgin", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcl", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Mol Biol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9306673", "ISSNLinking": "1039-9712"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7804127"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
