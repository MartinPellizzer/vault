More than 60 VOCs were determined from 850 samples collected from four sites in and around the complexes through a 2-year monitoring campaign from 2005 to 2007. The VOCs of particular concern found in the area were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, trichloroethylene, and formaldehyde, given their toxicity, concentration, and detection frequency. Toluene was the most abundant one. The VOC concentration rankings were consistent with their emission rankings. Most VOCs had higher concentrations at the industrial sites than at residential sites, indicating a significant impact of industrial emissions. The ambient levels of benzene and formaldehyde were additionally affected by vehicular emissions and secondary formation, respectively. Overall, the VOC levels increased in winter and at night, because of the local weather conditions. In contrast, the formaldehyde concentration increased in summer, owing to its secondary formation in the atmosphere. The ambient VOC levels in Sihwa-Banwol were higher than those in other parts of Korea. Additionally, the cumulative cancer risks posed by the toxic VOCs exceeded a tolerable risk level of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-4</sup> in not only the industrial areas but also the residential areas. The sum of the non-cancer risks in both areas significantly exceeded the threshold criterion of 1. The large amounts of aromatic compounds emitted from the industrial complexes are believed to play a crucial role in the elevated levels of surface ozone in the Seoul metropolitan area during the summer season. Therefore, comprehensive measures for controlling the VOC emissions in the Sihwa-Banwol area need to be prioritized to reduce the health risks for residents of not only this area but also the capital Seoul and its surrounding areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, 38541, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Min-Ji", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, 22689, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "Young-Kyo", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infra System, Hanseo University, Seosan, 31962, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jong-Ho", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3646-8409"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, 38541, Republic of Korea. sobaek@yu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Sung-Ok", "Initials": "SO"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2005-98", "Agency": "Korea National Institute of Environmental Researches", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seoul"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32418108", "10.1007/s11356-020-09217-x", "10.1007/s11356-020-09217-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
