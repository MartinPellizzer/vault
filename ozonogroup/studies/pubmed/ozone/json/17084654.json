The rate constant of ozone self-decomposition with ultrasonic radiation, which was one of the parameters in the model, was determined with separate experiments. The results showed that self-decomposition rate constants of ozone were enhanced by ultrasound. The self-decomposition rate constant of ozone is linearly dependent on ultrasonic power, but the increase of the decomposition rate could not enhance ozone mass transfer coefficient. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of ozone were also enhanced by ultrasonic radiation, while ultrasonic power had little effect on volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone. The degassing effect of ozone due to ultrasonic radiation was insignificant in the sparged system when ozone was bubbled during sonolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University, P.O.
