The electron beam irradiation processes applied represent so-called Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs); the combined ozone/electron beam irradiation is, moreover, the most powerful AOP which can be applied in aqueous systems. It was found that both ozonation and the two AOPs applied were able to decompose not only the NPEOs but also the polyethyleneglycoles (PEGs) formed as by-products from NPEO degradation to residual concentrations below the limit of detection. Moreover, the treatment processes were also used to study the oxidative degradation of nonylphenoxy acetic acid (NPEC) and of nonylphenol (NP) which are formed as by-products from biodegradation of NPEOs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Chemistry, IIQAB-CSIC, c/ Jordi Girona 18-26, 08034 Barcelona, Spain. mpeqam@cid.csic.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrovic", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gehringer", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eschweiler", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barcel\u00f3", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27986-36-3", "NameOfSubstance": "terics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15497852"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
