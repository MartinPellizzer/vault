There was evidence for a reduction in serum albumin concentration, which led to diminished detoxication capacities of the body. Concurrently, the effective albumin concentration and the binding capacity of both albumin and plasma became lower, which suggested higher blood toxicity. There was imbalance between the formation, accumulation and binding, utilization and elimination of toxic products, as confirmed by a rise in calculated intoxication criteria. Traditional therapy did not cause a significant reduction, which requires special detoxication therapy. Ozone therapy, an oxidative detoxication method substantially diminishes the severity of endogenous intoxication, as supported by an increase in the total concentration of albumin and its functional properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gazin", "ForeName": "I K", "Initials": "IK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Klin Lab Diagn", "NlmUniqueID": "9432021", "ISSNLinking": "0869-2084"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Foot"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suppuration"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18724429"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
