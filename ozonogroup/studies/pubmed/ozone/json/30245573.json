A 21-year Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulation for the continental United States provided the basis for the RFM developed in this study. Predictors included the principal component scores (PCS) of emissions and meteorological variables, while the predictand was the monthly mean of daily maximum 8-hour CMAQ ozone for the ozone season at each model grid. The PCS form an orthogonal basis for RFM inputs. A few PCS incorporate most of the variability of emissions and meteorology, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the source-receptor problem. Stochastic kriging was used to estimate the model. The RFM was used to separate the effects of emissions and meteorology on ozone concentrations. by running the RFM with emissions constant (ozone dependent on meteorology), or constant meteorology (ozone dependent on emissions). Years with ozone-conducive meteorology were identified, and meteorological variables best explaining meteorology-dependent ozone were identified. Meteorology accounted for 19% to 55% of ozone variability in the eastern US, and 39% to 92% in the western US. Temporal trends estimated for original CMAQ ozone data and emission-dependent ozone were mostly negative, but the confidence intervals for emission-dependent ozone are much narrower. Emission-driven changes in monthly mean ozone levels for the period 2000-2010 ranged from 6.4 to 10.9 ppb for the eastern US and from 1.4 to 2.5 ppb for the western US."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Porter-Gego, Idaho Falls, ID."}], "LastName": "Porter", "ForeName": "P Steven", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "S T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMAD/NERL, U.S.E.P.A., Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Hogrefe", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AMAD/NERL, U.S.E.P.A., Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "Rohit", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Atmos Pollut Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101554506"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ankenman B, Nelson BL and Staum J. 2010.
