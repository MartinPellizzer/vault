This study was designed to evaluate the association between child mortality and air pollution in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, from 1994 to 1997. Daily records of mortality due to respiratory diseases for children under 5 years of age were obtained from the municipal mortality information improvement program. Daily concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), inhalable particulate matter less than 10 microm in diameter (PM(10)), and ozone were obtained from the state air pollution controlling agency. Information on minimum daily temperature and on relative humidity were obtained from the Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Statistical analysis was performed through generalized additive models considering a Poisson response distribution and a log link. Explanatory variables were time, temperature, humidity, and pollutant concentrations. The loess smoother was applied to time (in order to model seasonality) and temperature. Significant associations between mortality and concentrations of CO, SO(2), and PM(10) were detected. The coefficients (and standard errors) of these three pollutants were 0.0306 (0.0076), 0.0055 (0.0016), and 0.0014 (0.0006), respectively. The observed associations were dose dependent and quite evident after a short period of exposure (2 days). According to the proposed model and considering the mean of the pollutant concentration during the period of the study, the estimated proportions of respiratory deaths attributed to CO, SO(2), and PM(10), when considered individually, are around 15, 13, and 7%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Polui\u00e7\u00e3o Atmosf\u00e9rica Experimental, Departamento de Patologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miraglia", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kishi", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saldiva", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singer", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Res. 1994 Jan;64(1):36-52", "ArticleIdList": ["8287841"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Nov;101(6):518-26", "ArticleIdList": ["8137781"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1994 May;65(2):218-25", "ArticleIdList": ["8187738"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1995 Mar-Apr;50(2):159-63", "ArticleIdList": ["7786052"]}, {"Citation": "Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 1999 Oct;13(4):475-88", "ArticleIdList": ["10563367"]}, {"Citation": "Bull Pan Am Health Organ. 1991;25(1):47-54", "ArticleIdList": ["2054552"]}, {"Citation": "Epidemiology. 1999 Mar;10(2):118-23", "ArticleIdList": ["10069245"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 1992 Oct 24;340(8826):1010-4", "ArticleIdList": ["1357409"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1992 Dec;59(2):362-73", "ArticleIdList": ["1464289"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1996 Mar 16;312(7032):665-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8597732"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 1996 Oct;46(10):927-39", "ArticleIdList": ["8875828"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Jun;105(6):608-12", "ArticleIdList": ["9288495"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1998 Jun;106(6):325-9", "ArticleIdList": ["9618348"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1992 May-Jun;47(3):211-7", "ArticleIdList": ["1596104"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11427383", "PMC1240551", "10.1289/ehp.109-1240551", "sc271_5_1835"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
