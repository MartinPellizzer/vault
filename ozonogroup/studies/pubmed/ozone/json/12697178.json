The combined gamma-rays/O(3) process showed a synergistic effect and enhanced the removal of TCE and PCE compared with gamma-rays alone, but, the gamma-rays/H(2)O(2) process did not increase the removal. This interesting result was successfully identified by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy/spin-trapping method that can quantify hydroxyl radicals, which is directly related to the efficiency of TCE and PCE decomposition. For gamma-rays/H(2)O(2) system, there was no difference of hydroxyl radical production between gamma-rays alone and gamma-rays/H(2)O(2). This indicates gamma-rays cannot activate H(2)O(2) to produce hydroxyl radicals and this causes no increase of TCE and PCE removals. To the contrary, the production of hydroxyl radicals was obviously increased in the case of gamma-rays/O(3) process. This suggests additional hydroxyl radicals are produced from the reaction of O(3) with the irradiation products of water such as hydrated electrons, hydrogen atoms, etc. and this accelerates the removal of TCE and PCE."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Science and Ecological Engineering, Korea University, 5-1 Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 136-701, South Korea. jjung@korea.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jinho", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Jeong-Hyo", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Hung-Ho", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Myun-Joo", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "290YE8AR51", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichloroethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TJ904HH8SN", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrachloroethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrachloroethylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trichloroethylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12697178", "10.1016/S0045-6535(03)00039-0", "S0045-6535(03)00039-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
