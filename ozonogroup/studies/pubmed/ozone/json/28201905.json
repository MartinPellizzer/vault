The analytical DMS representation used for the fit of ab initio points provides better behavior for large nuclear displacements than that of previous studies. Various DMS models were derived and tested. Vibration-rotation line intensities of <sup>16</sup>O<sub>3</sub> were calculated from these ab initio surfaces by the variational method using two different potential functions determined in our previous works. For the first time, a very good agreement of first principle calculations with the experiment was obtained for the line-by-line intensities in rotationally resolved ozone spectra in a large far- and mid-infrared range. This includes high overtone and combination bands up to \u0394V = 6. A particular challenge was a correct description of the B-type bands (even \u0394V<sub>3</sub> values) that represented major difficulties for the previous ab initio investigations and for the empirical spectroscopic models. The major patterns of various B-type bands were correctly described without empirically adjusted dipole moment parameters. For the 10 \u03bcm range, which is of key importance for the atmospheric ozone retrievals, our ab initio intensity results are within the experimental error margins. The theoretical values for the strongest lines of the \u03bd<sub>3</sub> band lie in general between two successive versions of HITRAN (HIgh-resolution molecular TRANsmission) empirical database that corresponded to most extended available sets of observations. The overall qualitative agreement in a large wavenumber range for rotationally resolved cold and hot ozone bands up to about 6000 cm<sup>-1</sup> is achieved here for the first time. These calculations reveal that several weak bands are yet missing from available spectroscopic databases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Groupe de Spectrom\u00e9trie Mol\u00e9culaire et Atmosph\u00e9rique UMR CNRS 7331, UFR Sciences BP 1039, 51687 Reims Cedex 2, France."}], "LastName": "Tyuterev", "ForeName": "Vladimir G", "Initials": "VG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Groupe de Spectrom\u00e9trie Mol\u00e9culaire et Atmosph\u00e9rique UMR CNRS 7331, UFR Sciences BP 1039, 51687 Reims Cedex 2, France."}], "LastName": "Kochanov", "ForeName": "Roman V", "Initials": "RV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "QUAMER Laboratory, Tomsk State University, Tomsk 634050, Russia."}], "LastName": "Tashkun", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28201905", "10.1063/1.4973977"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
