This study collected data from mares diagnosed with intrauterine bacterial growth and compared the outcome of different therapies for bacterial endometritis in German stud farm practice. Data on mares with positive uterine culture results were collected retrospectively in veterinary practices (n\u00a0=\u00a05; 2018-2022). Information relating to 30 factors (mare, diagnostics, therapy, pregnancy rate) of bacterial endometritis cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0772) were recorded and analyzed. Possible effects on treatment success (positive pregnancy result in the first cycle after treatment) were tested by binomial logistic regression. In most cases \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci were detected (n\u00a0=\u00a0707). Treatments for the endometritis included trimethoprim-sulfonamides (n\u00a0=\u00a0409), procaine-penicillin (n\u00a0=\u00a0227), marbofloxacin (n\u00a0=\u00a053) or no antibiotics (n\u00a0=\u00a059) and most antibiotics were administered systemically (n\u00a0=\u00a0711) rather than locally (n\u00a0=\u00a023). Uterine lavage was reported in 49\u00a0% of mares. Uterotonic drugs were administered in 42.2\u00a0% of mares. Breeding programs included artificial insemination (AI) with chilled semen (n\u00a0=\u00a0667), AI with frozen semen (n\u00a0=\u00a0169), transfer of fresh (n\u00a0=\u00a0112) or cryopreserved (n\u00a0=\u00a027) embryos and natural cover (n\u00a0=\u00a027). In the first cycle after treatment, the pregnancy rate was 47\u00a0% and it rose to 69\u00a0% by end of the season. Treatment success was affected by duration of antibiotic treatment, veterinary practice, and presence of clinical signs. In conclusion, reported treatment practices in German stud farm practice resulted in acceptable pregnancy results and the multiple binomial logistic regression approach identified factors affecting the pregnancy outcome in this dataset."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
