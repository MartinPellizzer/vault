Recently, it was reported that some unsaturated lipids of the pulmonary surfactants are oxidized by low-level ozone in ambient air. However, the molecular-level understanding of the reaction mechanism is still limited due to technical difficulties. We applied heterodyne-detected sum frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy to probe the reaction process of an unsaturated phospholipid monolayer (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC), which is one of the major lipids in the pulmonary surfactant, under low-level ozone (30 \u00b1 5 ppb). The HD-SFG spectroscopy realized the accurate peak assignments of the spectra and the identification of molecular species with high sensitivity, which were impossible with previous measurements. The time-resolved spectra indicated that the C\u2550C moiety in the unsaturated alkyl chain is selectively oxidized by ozone with a time constant of 22 \u00b1 3 min by first-order reaction kinetics. Furthermore, it was revealed for the first time that the reaction product of the POPC monolayer under low-level ozone is not the carboxylic form but the aldehyde form based on the vibrational spectroscopy results. The present study has deepened our molecular-level understanding of the oxidation mechanism of unsaturated lipids that are widely found in many biological systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6237-6618"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "Ken-Ichi", "Initials": "KI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}], "LastName": "Takada", "ForeName": "Chunji", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1047-2215"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Elements Strategy Initiative for Catalysts and Batteries (ESICB), Kyoto University, Kyoto 615-8520, Japan."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2104-0605"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Elements Strategy Initiative for Catalysts and Batteries (ESICB), Kyoto University, Kyoto 615-8520, Japan."}], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0090-7855"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Elements Strategy Initiative for Catalysts and Batteries (ESICB), Kyoto University, Kyoto 615-8520, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Shen", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem B", "NlmUniqueID": "101157530", "ISSNLinking": "1520-5207"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32478516", "10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c03408"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
