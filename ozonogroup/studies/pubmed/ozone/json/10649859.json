Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions occurred at a constant rate dependent on copy speed. However, VOC emission rates per copy were increased by increases in chamber temperature (e.g., a 20% increase resulted from increasing temperature from 23 degrees C to 32 degrees C) or changing from single- to double-sided operation (40% increase). Respirable particle emissions occurred under copier-idle mode (probably from residues in the machine) as well as with copying. No significant chamber sink effects were observed for VOCs or respirable particles. Small emissions of nitrogen dioxide, ozone and formaldehyde were observed but were difficult to interpret. A procedure for assessing pollutant emissions from photocopiers is recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Building, Construction and Engineering, Victoria, Australia.
