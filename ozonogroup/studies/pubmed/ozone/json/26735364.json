We report for the first time detailed pathways for the degradation of CYN by treatment with ozone. This was accomplished by use of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF MS), which revealed that CYN is readily degraded by ozone with at least 36 transformation products. Structural similarities among the major products indicated that the carbon-carbon double bond in the uracil ring of CYN was most susceptible to attack by ozone. Furthermore, the nitrogen functionality associated with the tricyclic guanidine moiety is also involved via a degradation pathway that has not been previously observed. To assess the potential toxicity of ozonation products of CYN, the cytotoxicity of CYN and the mixture of its ozonation products was measured in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). The IC50 for CYN at 24 and 48 h incubations was approximately 64.1 and 12.5 \u03bcM, respectively; however, the ozonation products of CYN did not exhibit measurable cytotoxicity to human cells. The results indicate ozone is an effective and practical method for CYN attenuation in water treatment without formation of overtly toxic transformation products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University , Shanghai, 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Shuwen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical & Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona , Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Ai", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical & Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona , Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States."}], "LastName": "Merel", "ForeName": "Sylvain", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical & Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona , Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States."}], "LastName": "Snyder", "ForeName": "Shane A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Florida International University , Miami, Florida 33199, United States."}], "LastName": "O'Shea", "ForeName": "Kevin E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering & Science Program, University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati, Ohio 45221, United States."}], "LastName": "Dionysiou", "ForeName": "Dionysios D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University , Shanghai, 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Weihua", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2JIZ556BA3", "NameOfSubstance": "cylindrospermopsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56HH86ZVCT", "NameOfSubstance": "Uracil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lakes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Uracil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26735364", "10.1021/acs.est.5b04540"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
