Their presence has been detected in rivers and wastewater treatment plants. Photocatalytic ozonation process using a low amount of 0.1\u202fwt% Ag-TiO<sub>2</sub> proved to be efficient on the degradation of a mixture of five parabens using a low transferred ozone dose (TOD). The pH effect was analyzed under acidic and neutral conditions. Also, the effect of hydroxyl radical scavenger on parabens degradation and on by-products formation was discussed. Hydroxyl radical present a significant role over parabens degradation and also on by-products formation. The reaction mechanism was analyzed using municipal wastewater as a matrix to infer about the behavior of the process at actual conditions. Municipal wastewater as a matrix clearly enhanced the parabens degradation when compared with the case where ultrapure water was used. In fact, the TOD required for total parabens degradation is lowered 10-20\u202fmg/L of TOD. Therefore, to understand the main responsible species for this improvement, the effects of several ions naturally present in wastewater (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) were tested. According to the results it seems that sulfate radical improves the process, while chloride and bicarbonate radicals decrease the process efficiency. In terms of toxicity the luminescence inhibition for Vibrio fischeri was analyzed. The inhibition significantly decreased for treated spiked municipal wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
