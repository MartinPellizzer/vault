However, in the face of the specific problem of quality deterioration caused by the increase of storage environment temperature due to unexpected circumstances or the prolongation of temporary storage time, it is still a technical challenge to realize intelligent decision-making and higher sterilization efficiency. In this paper, we propose an intelligent UV-Ozone sterilization system suitable for cold chain transportation of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). Using hierarchical analysis, equipartition method and the prediction method of generalized linear model, combined with the technology of intelligent control and remote control, we realized the automatic control of the system's UV irradiance from 324\u00a0\u223c\u00a01620\u00a0J/m<sup>2</sup>, and ozone concentration from21.4 \u223c\u00a0107\u00a0mg/cm<sup>3</sup> in a graded manner. The accuracy of the predicted structure was verified using a combination of direct measurement and simulation. In addition, the key model of the system, the intensity level decision model, was tested, and the test results showed that the decision model was able to accurately make decisions during the sterilization of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), and the system was able to achieve a sterilization effect of 1-3 orders of magnitude. This reduces quality loss due to unexpected conditions, facilitates real-time monitoring of transported samples by staff, extends the shelf life of the samples, and improves the accuracy of sterilization, increasing the economic value of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
