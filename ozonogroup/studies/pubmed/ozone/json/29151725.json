One of these techniques is the employment of large-area integrating sphere sources as radiance or irradiance secondary standards. To assist the National Aeronautical and Space Administration's space based ozone measurement program, a commercially available large-area internally illuminated integrating sphere source's spectral radiance was characterized in the wavelength region from 230 nm to 400 nm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Spectral radiance determinations and spatial mappings of the source indicate that carefully designed large-area integrating sphere sources can be measured with a 1 % to 2 % expanded uncertainty (two standard deviation estimate) in the near ultraviolet with spatial nonuniformities of 0.6 % or smaller across a 20 cm diameter exit aperture. A method is proposed for the calculation of the final radiance uncertainties of the source which includes the field of view of the instrument being calibrated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "James H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Ambler", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Res Natl Inst Stand Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "8912688", "ISSNLinking": "1044-677X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Heath DF Wei Zhongying, Fowler WK, Nelson VW.
