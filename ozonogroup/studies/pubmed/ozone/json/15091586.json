Destructive harvests were performed at anthesis and at maturity. Parts of the flag leaf or the second leaf were exposed to (14)CO(2) in small cuvettes for 5 min before, during and after anthesis. The translocation velocity was followed by autoradiography and scintillation counting of the plants frozen and lyophilized at different times after labelling. The label was transported at the same velocity in all the treatments. Ozone induced changes in carbon allocation or partitioning should probably be explained as amounts of carbon transported (mg s(-1)), rather than as transportation velocity (mm s(-1)). The amount translocated may be governed by source conditions under O(3) stress: reduced healthy green biomass and photosynthesis, but perhaps also by impairment of phloem loading because of membrane damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Environmental Research Institute, Department of Emissions and Air Pollution, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortensen", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Engvild", "ForeName": "K C", "Initials": "KC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091586", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)p2599-5", "0269-7491(94)P2599-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
