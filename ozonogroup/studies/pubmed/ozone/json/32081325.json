The result showed that the 8 h-max-O<sub>3</sub> concentrations displayed a distinct seasonality, where the maximum and minimum values, averaging 140.41, 54.19\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, occurred in summer and winter, respectively. There is a significant correlation between meteorological factors and O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The Voronoi neighborhood averaging analysis indicated that O<sub>3</sub>, temperature, and ultraviolet radiation in Henan province were decreased from northwest to southeast, while relative humidity and precipitation displayed the opposite trend. Besides meteorological factors, the chemical processes play an essential role in ozone formation. Reactions of NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> form a closed system, and the partitioning point of the OX-component (O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub>) was at 40 and 80\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>X</sub>) in winter and summer, respectively, with NO<sub>2</sub> dominating at higher NOx pollution and O<sub>3</sub> being the major component at lower levels. The relationship between oxidant (OX = O<sub>3</sub>+NO<sub>2</sub>) and NOx concentrations were evaluated to understand the regional and local contribution of OX. It showed that high regional contribution occurred in the spring, whereas the highest local contribution lead to the summer peak of O<sub>3</sub> observed in Zhengzhou. This present study reveals important environment impacts from the photochemical process and the meteorological conditions in the region with better understanding on the O<sub>3</sub> characterization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
