Increasing evidence suggested that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are ubiquitous pharmaceutical pollutants in natural waters. However, their TPs, reaction pathways, and secondary risks have been limitedly known during oxidative water treatment. This study systematically assessed the TP formation and transformation mechanisms of two typical CCBs (i.e., amlodipine, AML; verapamil, VER) oxidized by ferrate(VI), permanganate, and ozone, as well as the in silico prediction on the TPs' properties. The high-resolution mass spectrometer analysis suggested a total of 16 TPs of AML and 8 TPs of VER identified for these reaction systems. Transformation of AML mainly proceeded through hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, ether bond cleavage, NH<sub>2</sub> substitution by a hydroxyl group, and H-abstraction, while VER was oxidized via hydroxylation/opening of the aromatic ring and cleavage of the CN bond. Notably, certain TPs of both CCBs were estimated with low biodegradation, multi-endpoint toxicity, and high persistence and bioaccumulation, suggesting their severe risks to aquatic ecosystems. This study has implications for understanding the environmental behaviors, fate, and secondary risks of the globally prevalent and concerned CCBs under oxidative water treatment scenarios."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
