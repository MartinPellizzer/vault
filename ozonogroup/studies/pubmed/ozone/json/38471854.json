The reaction process presents complex non-linear relationships. In this work, datasets of atmospheric ozone and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) observed during the summer of 2018 in Nanjing were used. Combining with the framework for 0-D atmospheric model-master chemical mechanism (F0AM-MCM), the characteristics of photochemical reactions for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation in Nanjing during the O<sub>3</sub> episode days and non-episode days were investigated. The results showed that <i>\u03c6</i>(O<sub>3</sub>) and <i>\u03c6</i>(TVOCs) in the O<sub>3</sub> episode days were 47.8\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> and 49.0\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, respectively, exceeding those in the non-episode days by factors of 1.8 and 1.6. Furthermore, F0AM, the empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA), and relative incremental reactivity (RIR) were utilized for the calculation of ozone chemical sensitivity. It was found that O<sub>3</sub> formation in Nanjing was attributed to both VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> limitation. In addition, the modeled \u00b7OH and HO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the O<sub>3</sub> episode days were 1.3 and 1.8 times higher than those in the non-episode days. The higher formation and loss rates of \u00b7OH and HO<sub>2</sub> were also found during O<sub>3</sub> episode days. These findings reflected that the enhancements of atmospheric oxidation capacity resulted in increased production rates of O<sub>3</sub>, providing an explanation for the enhancements of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Nanjing during the O<sub>3</sub> episode days. The findings also improved the understanding of the O<sub>3</sub> photochemical characteristics over Nanjing in the summer during the O<sub>3</sub> episode days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Environment Center, Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation on Climate and Environmental Change Ministry of Education (ILCEC), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Li-Tong", "Initials": "LT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Environment Center, Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation on Climate and Environmental Change Ministry of Education (ILCEC), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Environment Center, Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation on Climate and Environmental Change Ministry of Education (ILCEC), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yu-Qi", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Environment Center, Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation on Climate and Environmental Change Ministry of Education (ILCEC), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Ahsan", "ForeName": "Mozaffar", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Environment Center, Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation on Climate and Environmental Change Ministry of Education (ILCEC), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Meng-Yao", "Initials": "MY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471854", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202303211"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
