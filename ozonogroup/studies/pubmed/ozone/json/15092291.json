Karst. plants, grown either on a sandy (No. 1) or on a calcareous (No. 2) soil, were treated with ozone (100 microg m(-3) and peaks of up to 360 microg m(-3)) and acid mist (pH 3.0) over two vegetation periods. Needles of the current (1987) and previous (1986) year were analysed at the end of the experiment for biosynthetic enzymes and in vivo activity of the phenylpropanoid pathway, for products of polyphenol metabolism (clones 11 and 14), and for mono- and sesquiterpenes (clones 14 and 16). 1. Polyphenol metabolism. The activity of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the lignin pathway, was increased by the treatment by up to 83% in the needles of both age classes. Chalcone synthase was measured in mature tree material for the first time. This enzyme, as well as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activities and the content of catechin, astringin, isorhapontin, picein and p-hydroxyacetophenone, exhibited no significant treatment-dependent differences. However, soil and age-class dependent differences occurred. Pulse-labelling experiments with l[U-(14)C]phenylalanine and [2-(14)C]acetate were carried out at four different stages of shoot development and showed label incorporation into (+)-catechin and proanthocyanidins. There was no effect of the ozone and acid mist treatment. 2. Monoterpenes. The content of needle terpenes was generally diminished by the ozone and acid mist treatment. Other factors tested, such as clone, needle age and soil, exerted a highly significant influence on the content of most of the needle monoterpenes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Biochemische Pflanzenpathologie, GSF Munichn, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstrabetae 1, D-8042 Neuherberg, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heller", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosemann", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osswald", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benz", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00f6nwitz", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lohwasser", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kloos", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandermann", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092291", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90057-j", "0269-7491(90)90057-J"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
