In this study two bryophyte species, Sphagnum recurvum P. Beauv. and Polytrichum commune Hedw., were exposed to long-term chronic ozone concentrations, i.e. 70-80 ppb (nl 1<sup>-1</sup> ), for 6-9 wk in summer conditions (mean 15\u00b0C) and in winter conditions (mean 6.4\u00b0C) in open-top chambers (OTC), in the field, and at 15\u00b0C and 5\u00b0C in controlled-environment chambers, under laboratory conditions. Fumigation with ozone caused a significant reduction in the growth of treated plants in comparison with that of control plants. However, there were differences between species. S. recurvum was more affected than P. commune. In the controlled-environment chambers growth of S. recurvum was reduced under both winter and summer conditions by 21 and 15%, respectively. In the OTCs, S. recurvum growth was reduced (by 17%) only under summer conditions. P. commune growth was only significantly reduced following ozone exposure in the OTCs under winter conditions. Here the growth reduction was by 22%. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation of the two species was also significantly reduced by ozone exposure but only in the OTCs under winter conditions. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation of S. recurvum and P. commune was reduced by 60 and 80%, respectively. The ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>m</sub> ratio) was the least affected of the parameters measured. Only for P. commune fumigated in the OTCs under winter conditions was the F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>m</sub> ratio significantly reduced (by 4.4%). Bryophytes, by the very nature of their morphology and physiology are, perhaps, more likely to be susceptible to ozone pollution than higher plants; these results are discussed in relation to their possible ecological significance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, The University, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Potter", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, The University, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Foot", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Manchester Metropolitan University, Crewe and Alsager Faculty, Crewe, Cheshire CW1 1DU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caporn", "ForeName": "S J M", "Initials": "SJM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, The University, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ashenden TW, Baxter R, Raferel CR. 1992 An inexpensive system for exposing plants in the field to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations.
