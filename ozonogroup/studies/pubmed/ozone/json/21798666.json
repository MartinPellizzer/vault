The total particle count (with D(p) of 6-225 nm) was up to 1.2 \u00d7 10(3)#cm(-3) with ACH of 1.08 h(-1), and it became much more significant with ACH of 0.36 h(-1) (1.1 \u00d7 10(4)#cm(-3)). This suggests that a higher ventilation rate can effectively dilute indoor BVOCs, resulting in a less ultrafine particle formation. The total particle count increased when temperature changed from 15 to 23 \u00b0C but it decreased when the temperature further increased to 30 \u00b0C. It could be explained that high temperature restrained the condensation of formed semi-volatile compounds resulting in low yields of SOAs. When the RH was at 50% and 80%, SOA formation (1.1-1.2 \u00d7 10(4)#cm(-3)) was the more efficient compared with that at RH of 30% (5.9 \u00d7 10(3)#cm(-3)), suggesting higher RH facilitating the initial nucleation processes. Oxidation generated secondary carbonyl compounds were also quantified. Acetone was the most abundant carbonyl compound. The formation mechanisms of formaldehyde and acetone were proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
