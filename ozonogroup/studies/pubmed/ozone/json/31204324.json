Irrigation was done after 2 weeks of scaling and root planning on the same day with ozonated water and 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate for two and half minutes. The clinical parameters like gingival index, probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded for both the groups at the baseline visit.They were subsequently recalled after 4 weeks and 3 months interval from the baseline visit. Data thus collected was compiled and put to statistical analysis.", "The present study showed significant results in both the groups with regards to the improvement in the clinical parameters. When comparison was made between the two groups, ozonated water showed slightly better improvement than the chlorhexidine group. However, a statistically significant difference was seen only with Plaque score.", "Subgingival irrigation with ozonized water is beneficial than present conventional therapeutic modalities. Ozonated water restricts the formation of dental plaque and reduces the number of subgingival pathogens thereby treating periodontal diseases.", "Ozone therapy is proving to be a new useful treatment modality which offers great benefits to the patients. The strong antimicrobial power of ozone, along with its ability to stimulate the circulatory system and modulate the immune response, makes it a remedial agent of choice in the treatment of various infectious oral diseases. The study was conducted to justify the routine use of ozone as a treatment modality in effective management of periodontal diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Surendera Dental College, Hospital and Research Institute, Sriganganagar, Rajasthan, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Amritpal", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Periodontics and Community Dental Sciences, College of Dentistry, King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Phone: +966550654934, e-mail: sbhavhkatti@kku.edu.sa."}], "LastName": "Bhavikatti", "ForeName": "Shaeesta K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Institute of Dental Sciences, Siksha O Anusandhan Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Sitansu S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Mansarovar Dental College, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Khanna", "ForeName": "Sagar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Dentistry, Manav Rachna Dental College, Faridabad, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Jain", "ForeName": "Meena", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontolgy and Oral Implantology, Maharishi Markandeshwar College of Dental Sciences and Research, Mullana, Haryana India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Avineet", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Contemp Dent Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101090552", "ISSNLinking": "1526-3711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MOR84MUD8E", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorhexidine gluconate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Scaling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31204324", "1526-3711-2279"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
