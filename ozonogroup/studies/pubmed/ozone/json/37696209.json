We performed an individual-level, time-stratified case-crossover study among over 0.9 million diabetes deaths from all administrative regions of Chinese mainland during 2013-2019. Daily concentrations of fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), coarse particles (PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were obtained for each decedent using high-resolution prediction models. Conditional logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the data. Each interquartile range increment in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on lag 0-2 d increased the risks of overall diabetes mortality by 2.81 %, 1.92 %, 3.96 % and 2.15 %, respectively. Type 2 diabetes had stronger associations with air pollution than type 1 diabetes. Air pollutants were associated with diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic nephropathy, but not other complications. The exposure-response curves were approximately linear with a plateau at higher concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>, while the associations for O<sub>3</sub> appear to be statistically significant beyond 60\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. This nationwide study reinforces the evidence of higher risks of acute diabetic events following short-term air pollution exposure. We identified differential effects of air pollutants on various subtypes and complications of diabetes, which require further mechanistic investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
