Most of the dye wastewater treating methods focused on the treatment of wastewater after the rinsing process of dyed textile. In this paper, tetraacetylethylenediamine/hydrogen peroxide (TAED/H\u2082O\u2082) active oxidation (AO) system was developed to rinse dyed textile and decolorize the rinsing wastewater simultaneously. The results indicated that the decolorization ratio of the rinse effluent obtained by AO method were in the range of 51.72%-84.15% according to different dyes and the COD value decreased more than 30% compared with that of traditional rinsing process. The decolorization kinetics investigation showed that the decolorization of dyes during AO rinsing process followed the law of pseudo-first order kinetics. The result of UV-Vis and UPLC-MS analysis demonstrated that the dye was degraded into colorless organic molecular fragments and partly mineralized during the AO rinsing process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Light Industry, Textile and Food Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China. luoshifly@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Deng-Hong", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Qing-Kang", "Initials": "QK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qing-Shu", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Xing", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Zong-Yao", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soaps"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cotton Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soaps"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20729577", "10.2166/wst.2010.307"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
