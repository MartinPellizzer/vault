These measurement include stratospheric ozone (approximately 90% of total ozone) and tropospheric ozone. The total ozone measurements from Arosa, the world longest series started at 1926, indicate, that total ozone has declined since about 1970 by approximately 5%. The ozone balloon soundings, operationally performed at Payerne since 1969 (2-3 ascents per week) show, that stratospheric ozone has decreased strongly in the last 20 years, whereas tropospheric ozone, remarkably has increased during this period. The relative change was strongest in the troposphere (more than 10% per decade, 3-4% increase per year during 1982-1988). However, on an absolute scale, changes in the stratosphere were strongest (relative decrease: 6 to 7% per decade at 20-22 km). The present scientific theories of the two ozone problems are reviewed: stratospheric ozone decrease was caused by the anthropogenic emissions of fluorochlorocarbons and other compounds mainly released from the earth surface. Tropospheric ozone has increased due to photochemical production of mainly anthropogenically emitted nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and CO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Atmosph\u00e4renphysik, ETH Z\u00fcrich."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Staehelin", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Die beiden Ozonprobleme: zuviel in der Troposph\u00e4re, zuwenig in der Stratosph\u00e4re."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Schweiz Rundsch Med Prax", "NlmUniqueID": "8403202", "ISSNLinking": "1013-2058"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1546226"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
