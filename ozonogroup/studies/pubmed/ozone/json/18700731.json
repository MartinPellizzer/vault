SOA was generated via the dark reaction of ozone and d-limonene, collected onto quartz-fiber filters, and exposed to wavelength-tunable radiation. Photochemical production of CO was monitored in situ by infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopy. A number of additional gas-phase products of SOA photodegradation were observed by gas chromatography, including methane, ethene, acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol, and 1-butene. The absorption spectrum of SOA material collected onto CaF2 windows was measured and compared with the photolysis action spectrum for the release of CO, a marker for Norrish type-I photocleavage of carbonyls. Both spectra had a band at approximately 300 nm corresponding to the overlapping n --> pi* transitions in nonconjugated carbonyls. The effective extinction coefficient of freshly prepared SOA was estimated to be on the order of 15 L mol(-1) cm(-1) at 300 nm, implying one carbonyl group in every SOA constituent. The absorption by the SOA material slowly increased in the visible and near-UV during storage of SOA in open air in the dark, presumably as a result of condensation reactions that increased the degree of conjugation in the SOA constituents. These observations suggest that photolysis of carbonyl functional groups represents a significant sink for monoterpene SOA compounds in the troposphere, with an estimated lifetime of several hours over the continental United States."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mang", "ForeName": "Stephen A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henricksen", "ForeName": "Dana K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bateman", "ForeName": "Adam P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "Mads P Sulbaek", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blake", "ForeName": "Donald R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14808-60-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Quartz"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GO1N1ZPR3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quartz"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18700731", "10.1021/jp804376c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
