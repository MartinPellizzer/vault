To assess if this process is a relevant source for CCN in the atmosphere, the reaction rate at atmospheric conditions must be known. Here we investigate the increase in CCN activity of soot particles rich in organic carbon at O<sub>3</sub> concentrations ranging from 0-200 ppb and between 5 and 35 \u00b0C. We operated an \u223c3 m<sup>3</sup> aerosol chamber as a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor which allows for aging times of up to 12 h and beyond and of particle size selection prior to the aging step. We applied the activation time (<i>t</i><sub>act</sub>) concept to retrieve kinetic data. It was found that 100 nm soot particles can be CCN-active down to supersaturations of 0.3% after 12 h of exposure to 200 ppb O<sub>3</sub> at 35 \u00b0C. The reaction rate was found to be not directly proportional to the O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Instead, a Langmuir-type reaction kinetic was found to be the best fit to parametrize the reaction rates. The initial reaction step is therefore the adsorption of O<sub>3</sub> molecules, which could be detected by an increase in the particle diameter of up to 3.7 nm within several minutes after exposure. The increase in particle diameter agrees well with the calculated change in the O<sub>3</sub> surface coverage, which was obtained from CCN activation data under the assumption of a Langmuir-sorption isotherm. Further, we found that a temperature increase from 5 to 35 \u00b0C increases the reaction rate by a factor of 5 which corresponds to an activation energy of 38.5 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>. Extrapolation to atmospheric conditions allows for the conclusion that the temperature is as important as the O<sub>3</sub> concentration for the CCN activation of soot particles within the atmospheric range."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science , ETH Zurich , Zurich 8092 , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Friebel", "ForeName": "Franz", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science , ETH Zurich , Zurich 8092 , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7188-171X"], "LastName": "Mensah", "ForeName": "Amewu A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31545616", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b02372"]}}]}
