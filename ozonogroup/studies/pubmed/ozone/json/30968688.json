Here, we present a multiyear observational analysis using data collected before, during, and after the record-breaking California drought (2011-2015) at the O<sub>3</sub>-polluted locations of Fresno and Bakersfield near the Sierra Nevada foothills. We separately assess drought influences on O<sub>3</sub> chemical production ( PO<sub>3</sub>) from O<sub>3</sub> concentration. We show that isoprene concentrations, which are a source of O<sub>3</sub>-forming organic reactivity, were relatively insensitive to early drought conditions but decreased by more than 50% during the most severe drought years (2014-2015), with recovery a function of location. We find drought-isoprene effects are temperature-dependent, even after accounting for changes in leaf area, consistent with laboratory studies but not previously observed at landscape scales with atmospheric observations. Drought-driven decreases in organic reactivity are contemporaneous with a change in dominant oxidation mechanism, with PO<sub>3</sub> becoming more NO <sub>x</sub>-suppressed, leading to a decrease in PO<sub>3</sub> of \u223c20%. We infer reductions in atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> loss of \u223c15% during the most severe drought period, consistent with past observations of decreases in O<sub>3</sub> uptake by plants. We consider drought-related trends in O<sub>3</sub> variability on synoptic time scales by analyzing statistics of multiday high-O<sub>3</sub> events. We discuss implications for regulating O<sub>3</sub> air pollution in California and other locations under more prevalent drought conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22904 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0618-9022"], "LastName": "Demetillo", "ForeName": "Mary Angelique G", "Initials": "MAG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22904 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Jaime F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environment , Boston University , Boston , Massachusetts 02215 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geddes", "ForeName": "Jeffrey A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22904 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Saint Mary's College , Notre Dame , Indiana 46556 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Najacht", "ForeName": "Emily Y", "Initials": "EY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22904 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herrera", "ForeName": "Solianna A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics , University of California Irvine , Irvine , California 92697 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kabasares", "ForeName": "Kyle M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , University of Houston , Houston , Texas 77204 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotsakis", "ForeName": "Alexander E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22904 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22904 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lerdau", "ForeName": "Manuel T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22904 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pusede", "ForeName": "Sally E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nevada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30968688", "10.1021/acs.est.8b04852"]}}]}
