However, the short-term association between air pollution and lung cancer mortality (LCM) remains largely unknown.", "We collected daily data on particulate matter with diameter <2.5\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter with diameter\u202f<\u202f10\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and LCM in three of the biggest cities in China, i.e. Beijing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, from 2013 to 2015. We first estimated city-specific relationships between air pollutants and LCM using time-series generalized linear models, adjusting for potential confounders. A classification and regression tree (CART) model was used to stratify LCM risk based on combinations of air pollutants and meteorological factors in each city. Then we pooled the city-specific associations using random-effects meta-analysis. Meta regression was used to explore if city-specific characteristics modified the air pollution-LCM association. Finally, we stratified the analyses by season, age, and sex.", "Over the entire period, the current-day concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> in Chongqing and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> in Guangzhou were positively associated with LCM (Excess risk ranged from 0.72% (95% CI 0.27%-1.17%) to 6.06% (95% CI 0.76%-11.64%) with each 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in different pollutants), but the association between current-day air pollution and LCM in Beijing was not significant (P\u202f>\u202f0.05). When considering the environmental and weather factors simultaneously, current-day PM<sub>2.5</sub>, relative humidity, and PM<sub>10</sub> were the most important factors associated with LCM in Beijing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, respectively. LCM risk related with daily PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> significantly increased with the increasing annual mean temperature and humidity of the city, while LCM risk related with daily O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased with the increases of latitude, annual mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration, and socioeconomic level. After stratification, the current-day PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> during the warm season in Beijing and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> during the cool season in Chongqing and Guangzhou were positively associated with LCM (Excess risk ranged from 0.93% (95% CI 0.42%-1.45%) to 7.16% (95% CI 0.64%-14.09%) with each 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in different pollutants). Male and the elderly lung cancer patients were more sensitive to the short-term effect of air pollution.", "Lung cancer patients should enhance protection measures against air pollution. More attentions should be paid for the high PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> during the warm season in Beijing, and high PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> during the cool season in Chongqing and Guangzhou."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
