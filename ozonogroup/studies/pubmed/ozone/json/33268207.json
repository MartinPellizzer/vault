It is highly desired to explore the effect of supports on VOCs oxidation processes during plasma catalysis. In this work, four supports of SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZSM-5-300, ZSM-5-38 and \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> loading with transition metal oxides were used to decompose toluene at room temperature. It was found that toluene decomposition with 1\u00a0wt%Mn/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was highest, which was strongly proportional to the ozone decomposition ability of the catalyst. The plasma catalytic decomposition of toluene over 1\u00a0wt% MnO<sub>2</sub> on different supports were characterized using in situ plasma diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrometer. The results showed that 1\u00a0wt%Mn/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> could further catalyze toluene to carbonate and bicarbonate via the breakage of C-C bonds from benzoic acid, while that was difficult for 1\u00a0wt% Mn/SiO<sub>2</sub>, 1\u00a0wt%Mn/ZSM-5-300 and 1\u00a0wt%Mn/ZSM-5-38. The reaction mechanism of toluene decomposition on different catalysts were proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
