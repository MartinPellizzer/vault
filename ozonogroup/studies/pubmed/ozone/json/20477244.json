Albuterol is most commonly administered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI). MDIs had used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants, but CFCs accumulate in the stratosphere and contribute to ozone catabolism. Loss of the 'ozone layer', which filters UVB rays, has public health concerns. Albuterol has been reformulated in MDIs using hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants, which do not affect the ozone layer. Albuterol HFA MDIs deliver the same amount of drug per puff with similar particle size distributions as albuterol CFC MDIs, resulting in comparable bronchodilator efficacy of the two products. The highly favorable safety profile of albuterol has not been altered with reformulation. The propellant HFA-134a appears to be devoid of safety concerns."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The George Washington University School of Medicine, and Pulmonary, Critical Care and Respiratory Services, Washington Hospital Center, 110 Irving Street, NW Washington, DC 20010, USA. gene.colice@medstar.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colice", "ForeName": "Gene L", "Initials": "GL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Rev Respir Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101278196", "ISSNLinking": "1747-6348"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20477244", "10.1586/17476348.2.2.149"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
