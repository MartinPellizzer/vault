Oxidant doses within and beyond immediate ozone demand completion were tested. Through experiments involving the continuous addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a semi-continuous contactor, it was demonstrated that this new approach could lead to a 36 % reduction of the overall O<sub>3</sub> needs for a constant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> molar ratio of 0.25 compared to single ozonation, representing a 28 % reduction in energy consumption. This improvement was mainly attributed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition during the secondary ozonation stage, where the direct ozone demand becomes less important. The OH-exposure per consumed ozone (i.e., R<sub>OHO3</sub> concept) calculation demonstrated that higher (0.5-1) and lower (0.25) oxidant relationships work better in improving the process performance during initial and secondary stages, respectively. Moreover, continuous versus total initial addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were compared and the first one showed better performance, representing differences in energy costs up to 21 %. Finally, two strategies for the real-time control of the O<sub>3</sub>-recalcitrant MPs fate were tested, one based on the R<sub>OHO3</sub> concept and the other on UVA<sub>254</sub> monitoring. Both resulted in accurate predictions (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.96) for different compounds, effluents and processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
