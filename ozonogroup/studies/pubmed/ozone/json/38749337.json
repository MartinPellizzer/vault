Online flow cytometry (online FCM) allows for automated quantification of total and intact microbial cells. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of online FCM for full-scale drinking water ozone disinfection system performance monitoring. A water treatment plant with high lime solids turbidity in the ozone contactor influent was selected to evaluate the online FCM in challenging conditions. Total and intact cell counts were monitored for 40 days and compared to surrogate parameters (ozone residual, ozone dose, and CT) and grab sample assay results for cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), impedance flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Online FCM provided insight into the dynamics of the full-scale ozone system, including offering early warning of increased contactor effluent cell concentrations, which was not observed using surrogate measures. Positive correlations were observed between online FCM intact cell counts and cATP levels (Kendall's tau=0.40), HPC (Kendall's tau=0.20), and impedance flow cytometry results (Kendall's tau=0.30). Though a strong correlation between log intact cell removal and CT was not observed, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that passage through the ozone contactor significantly changed the microbial community (p < 0.05). Potential causes of the low overall cell inactivation in the contactor and the significant changes in the microbial community after ozonation include regrowth in the later chambers of the contactor and varied ozone resistance of drinking water microorganisms. This study demonstrates the suitability of direct, online microbial analysis for monitoring full-scale disinfection systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
