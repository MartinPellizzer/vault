Most of the current studies have focused on the toxic effects caused by plastics and have not actively investigated the mechanisms causing cell death, especially at the subcellular level. The main content of this paper focuses on two aspects, one is a review of the current status of MNPLs contamination and recent advances in toxicological studies, which highlights the possible concentration levels of MNPLs in the environment and the internal exposure of humans. It is also proposed to pay attention to the compound toxicity of MNPLs as carriers of other environmental pollutants and pathogenic factors. Secondly, subcellular toxicity is discussed and the modes of entry and intracellular distribution of smaller-size MNPLs are analyzed, with particular emphasis on the importance of organelle damage to elucidate the mechanism of toxicity. Importantly, MNPLs are a new type of environmental pollutant and researchers need to focus not only on their toxicity, but also work with governments to develop measures to reduce plastic emissions, optimize degradation and control plastic aggression against organisms, especially humans, from multiple perspectives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
