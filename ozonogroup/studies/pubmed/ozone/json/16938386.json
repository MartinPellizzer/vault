Its formation and influence on the reaction mechanism were examined. Semi-batch experiments showed that hydrogen peroxide was formed during the direct reaction between molecular ozone and 4-CP. The detected hydrogen peroxide could reach 12.3% of the initial mole concentration of 4-CP. Hydrogen peroxide reacts with ozone in neutral pH and leads to the appearance of the powerful oxidant, OH* radicals. An O(3)/OH* probe compound, succinate was then developed, and also included in the 4-CP solution matrix. The disappearance of succinate with time shows the amount of OH radicals. With enough tert-butanol inhibiting the OH* radical oxidation, results showed that 4-CP was transformed to para-quinone by ozone, and subsequently destroyed to formic acid and oxalic acid. Without scavengers of inactivation the OH* radicals, 4-CP was destroyed to low molecular weight acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pi", "ForeName": "Yunzheng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lisheng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianlong", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3DLC36A01X", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorophenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AB6MNQ6J6L", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Succinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16938386", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.07.032", "S0304-3894(06)00826-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
