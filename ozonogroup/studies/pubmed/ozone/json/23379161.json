The results showed that acetic acid had a high ozone stability and solubility. OTC had a high removal rate and degradation rate in acetic acid solution. With the increase of OTC dosage, the removal rate of OTC decreased in acetic acid. Removal rate of OTC was increased distinctly when ozone flow increased properly. It was also observed that free radical scavenger had a significantly negative effect on OTC ozonation degradation in acetic acid. Furthermore the main reactions of OTC ozone oxidation were direct oxidation and indirect oxidation in acetic acid. When Fe3+ and Co2+ were existent in acetic acid, the degradation of OTC was inhibited significantly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographical Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210046, China. lishiyin7@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shi-Yin", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yi-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jiang-Peng", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guo-Xiang", "Initials": "GX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X20I9EN955", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytetracycline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oxytetracycline"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23379161"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
