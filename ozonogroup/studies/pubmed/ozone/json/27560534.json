Ozone (O3) is a gas that contains three atoms of oxygen with a cyclic structure. It has been suggested that application of low-dose ozone has an antioxidant effect and provides resistance to oxidative stress. We investigated the effect of oxygen-ozone therapy on rat femoral artery vasospasm.", "Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly separated into vasospasm, vasospasm + ozone and control groups. The femoral artery vasospasm model was used. Rats in the vasospasm + ozone group were given 4 mL of ozone (20 \u03bc/mL) daily for 7 days. Femoral arteries were examined by light microscopy for histological changes and morphometric analysis. Kruskal Wallis test and Mann Whitney U tests were used for the statistical analysis. The values of p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 were recognized as statistically significant.", "Ozone treatment reduced the morphometric changes as irregularity of the elastic lamina, disruption of the endothelial cells, vacuolization and hemorrhages that caused by vasospasm. The measurements of the wall thickness (p=0.003; p < 0.01) and lumen diameter (p=0.001; p < 0.01) showed statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) between the vasospasm and vasospasm+ozone groups.", "Ozone therapy may be useful in the treatment of post-hemorrhagic vasospasm."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haydarpasa Numune Teaching and Research Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Orakdogen", "ForeName": "Metin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uslu", "ForeName": "Serap", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Emon", "ForeName": "Selin Tural", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Somay", "ForeName": "Hakan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meric", "ForeName": "Zeynep Cingu", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hakan", "ForeName": "Tayfun", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Turk Neurosurg", "NlmUniqueID": "9423821", "ISSNLinking": "1019-5149"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Femoral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Vasospasm, Intracranial"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27560534", "10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.14162-15.2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
