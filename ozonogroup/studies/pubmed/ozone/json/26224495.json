Chemical substances which are formed during this process escape into the operating room through trocars in the form of surgical smoke. The aim of this study was to identify and quantitatively measure a number of selected chemical substances found in surgical smoke and to assess the risk they carry to medical personnel.", "The study was performed at the Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Memorial Provincial Specialist Hospital in Zgierz between 2011 and 2013. Air samples were collected in the operating room during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.", "A complete qualitative and quantitative analysis of the air samples showed a number of chemical substances present, such as aldehydes, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, ozone, dioxins and others.", "The concentrations of these substances were much lower than the hygienic standards allowed by the European Union Maximum Acceptable Concentration (MAC). The calculated risk of developing cancer as a result of exposure to surgical smoke during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is negligible. Yet it should be kept in mind that repeated exposure to a cocktail of these substances increases the possibility of developing adverse effects. Many of these compounds are toxic, and may possibly be carcinogenic, mutagenic or genotoxic. Therefore, it is necessary to remove surgical smoke from the operating room in order to protect medical personnel."], "CopyrightInformation": "This work is available in Open Access model and licensed under a CC BY-NC 3.0 PL license."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical University of Lodz, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Department of General and Oncological Surgery). miloszd@onet.pl."}], "LastName": "Dobrogowski", "ForeName": "Mi\u0142osz", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Department of Chemical Hazard). wwesolow@imp.lodz.pl."}], "LastName": "Wesolowski", "ForeName": "Wiktor", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Department of Chemical Hazard). mkuch@imp.lodz.pl."}], "LastName": "Kucharska", "ForeName": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical University of Lodz, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Department of General and Oncological Surgery)."}], "LastName": "Paduszy\u0144ska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical University of Lodz, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Department of General and Oncological Surgery). agacelnik@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Dworzy\u0144ska", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Lodz, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Institute of Psychology). wiesiek_szym@yahoo.co.uk."}], "LastName": "Szymczak", "ForeName": "Wies\u0142aw", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical University of Lodz, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Department of Toxicology and Bromatology). andrzej.sapota@umed.lodz.pl."}], "LastName": "Sapota", "ForeName": "Andrzej", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical University of Lodz, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland (Department of General and Oncological Surgery). pomorskil@op.pl."}], "LastName": "Pomorski", "ForeName": "Lech", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Occup Med Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9437093", "ISSNLinking": "1232-1087"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electrocoagulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Laparoscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Operating Rooms"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26224495", "10.13075/ijomeh.1896.00374", "58519"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
