However, little information is available on the response of crops (especially maize) to the interactive effects of O<sub>3</sub> and nitrogen (N) fertilizer. To this end, a maize cultivar (Zheng dan 958, ZD958) that is common in China was exposed to two O<sub>3</sub> treatments and four N levels. We found that (1) the interactions between O<sub>3</sub> and N were non-significant for grain yield, plant biomass, C and N, although N addition significantly increased all parameters except C concentrations in grain and plant; (2) compared to NF (non-filtered ambient air O<sub>3</sub> concentration), NF60 (NF plus an extra 60\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub>) increased the optimum N application rates (N<sub>opt</sub>) in grain yield and plant biomass, but not grain yield and plant biomass potentials, thus resulting in lower N use efficiencies (NUE) and a larger risk of N-related environmental pollution (e.g., increased N<sub>2</sub>O emission) under N<sub>opt</sub> in NF60; (3) because of higher optimum plant N uptake (PN<sub>opt</sub>) in NF60, relative to NF, plant N-saturated conditions for grain yield potential can be gradually turned into N-limited conditions as O<sub>3</sub> pollution increases. These findings manifest that O<sub>3</sub> is a vital global change factor impacting the management of N fertilization. If current O<sub>3</sub> pollution is substantially reduced, maize yield and biomass potentials can be increased under reductions in N input and N-related environmental pollution. In addition, these results can also contribute in developing and verifying N<sub>opt</sub> model considering O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
