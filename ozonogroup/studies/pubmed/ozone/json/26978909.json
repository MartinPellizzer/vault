The article studied the impact of fertilization and water on the emission of N2 0 from the cabbage farmland using FTIR spectrometry. To enhance the sensitivity of the measuring system, we used multi-reflecting mirrors to increase the optical pathlength. By comparing the infrared spectra between the before and after fertilizer application and the NIST spectral library, finally, the band at 2160-2225 cm\u207b\u00b9 was chosen as the spectral characteristics band of quantitative calculation of N\u2082O through analyzing. The research found that fertilization and water could promote the emission of N2 0 from the cabbage farmland soil, which could supply theory bases for emission reduction of N\u2082O and slowing down the greenhouse effect. Finally, we also studied the diurnal emission rules of N\u2082O from the fertilized soil; the results showed that the emission of N\u2082O was lower at night and the results were compared with that of previous' studies, which verifies the feasibility of this method. The results proved that FTIR with long optical path was a rapid and effective method to measure the emission rules of N\u2082O from the cabbage farmland soil, which can measure the gas emissions of N\u2082O from the fertilized cabbage farmland soil and compared with other traditional measuring methods, it had the advantages such as rapidness and convenience."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Guang-dong", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Da-ming", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dong-yan", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bao-hua", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Tong-qing", "Initials": "TQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26978909"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
