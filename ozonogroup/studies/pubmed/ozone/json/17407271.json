The discharge generators differ from conventional chemical singlet oxygen generators in that they produce significant amounts of atomic oxygen. Post-discharge chemistry includes channels that lead to the formation of ozone. Consequently, removal of I(2P1/2) by O atoms and O3 may impact the efficiency of discharge driven iodine lasers. In the present study, we have measured the rate constants for quenching of I(2P1/2) by O(3P) atoms and O3 using pulsed laser photolysis techniques. The rate constant for quenching by O3, (1.8 +/- 0.4) x 10(-12) cm3 s-1, was found to be a factor of 5 smaller than the literature value. The rate constant for quenching by O(3P) was (1.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(-11) cm3 s-1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azyazov", "ForeName": "Valeriy N", "Initials": "VN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Antonov", "ForeName": "Ivan O", "Initials": "IO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heaven", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17407271", "10.1021/jp068546g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
