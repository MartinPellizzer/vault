However, CBAT can also favor a shift in DBP formation to more toxic brominated DBP species. To protect public health, treatment-specific DBP formation and speciation trends need to be identified and understood. First, this study systematically evaluated the treatment of six wastewater effluents with four CBAT process trains (experimental n was 55) and measured DBP formation and speciation trends. Overall, CBAT decreased DBP formation by >90% and GAC preferentially removed highly-reactive effluent organic matter as indicated by lower yields of both highly-forming and highly-toxic classes of carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBPs. Since GAC treatment also induced systematic speciation changes by increasing the ratio of bromide to dissolved organic matter, the second part of this study focused on understanding the health impacts of DBP speciation changes on calculated additive toxicity (CAT). Based on the evaluation of 20 DBPs, measured using established methods, the CAT values from cyto- and genotoxicity metrics decreased by as much as 85% due to high levels of precursor removal by GAC. Expanding the evaluation to include 52 DBPs, measured using more extensive analytical methods, resulted in the same conclusions. This study also developed a \"speciation potency\" metric, that re-scales class-by-class speciation trends using toxic potency factors (e.g., cytotoxicity [LC<sub>50</sub>]). The observed shifts in DBP speciation after treatment increased the class-level toxic potency factors by up to a factor of 4; a greater amount of precursor removal is required for treatment to reduce toxicity, which was achieved with CBAT trains. This proposed approach of combining speciation potency with DBP yields enables evaluation of DBP-associated risk with easily measured surrogates (i.e., bromide and dissolved organic carbon [DOC]). By identifying and quantitatively comparing DBP formation and speciation trends over multiple wastewater effluents and treatment trains, this study demonstrates that CBAT can be a robust approach to DBP precursor removal for potable reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
