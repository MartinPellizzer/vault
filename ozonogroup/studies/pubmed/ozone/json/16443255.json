To investigate the behaviours of the large molecular refractory organic compounds when they were subjected to oxidation with ozone only (O3 only) and ozone combined with hydrogen peroxide (O3/H2O2), the aged raw landfill leachate first was filtered with 0.8 and 0.45 microm pore size filters in series, then was sequentially fractionated with 10,000 MWCO; 5000 MWCO; and 1000 MWCO membranes, and four samples were formed: 0.45 microm-10,000 Da; 10,000-5000 Da; 5000-1000 Da; and < 1000 Da. Mass distribution profiles of COD, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), colour and metals in the aged raw leachate were developed through mass balance. After membrane fractionation of the aged raw leachate, the metals were fractionated with the humic substances. Each fractionated sample as well as the aged raw leachate was oxidised with O3 only and O3/H2O2. The H2O2 enhanced the reduction of COD and colour; while, the BOD5 after O3 only was always higher than that of O3/H2O2. The addition of H2O2 improved the peak reduction of large molecules, but the effects of H2O2 on the fractions of 10,000-5000 Da and 5000-1000 Da were likely insignificant, which is in accordance with the COD results. No correlation was found between the BOD5 increase and the area of new peak formed after oxidation. However, the BOD5 of each sample after oxidation with O3 only was the logarithmic function of its total peak area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northern Region, Alberta Environment, 111 Twin Atria Building, 4999-98 Avenue, Edmonton, Alta., Canada T6B 2X3.
