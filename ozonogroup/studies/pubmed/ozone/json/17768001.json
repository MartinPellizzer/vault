The review is limited to details of the destruction of three classes of endocrine disruptors, namely bisphenols, alkylphenols and phthalates, which are among the most highly suspected endocrine disrupting compounds that interfere with the hormonal system of wildlife. It was found that photocatalysis with titanium dioxide was the most frequently tested advanced oxidation method most likely due its potential to render complete mineralization. There is sufficient research also with direct and indirect photolysis and ozonation, which were less effective for the overall mineralization but more representative of the conditions existing in real water treatment plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bogazici University, Institute of Environmental Sciences, 34342 Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcltekin", "ForeName": "Isil", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ince", "ForeName": "Nilsun H", "Initials": "NH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Manage", "NlmUniqueID": "0401664", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}], "NumberOfReferences": "109"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17768001", "10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.07.020", "S0301-4797(07)00287-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
