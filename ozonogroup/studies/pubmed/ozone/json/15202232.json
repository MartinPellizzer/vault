HPLC, GC, IC and UV were used to follow the intermediate and ultimate oxidation products produced in the ozonation of alachlor. The results showed that 94% alachlor was degraded after being directly ozonated for 30 min at acidic condition. But alachlor could not be completely degraded to CO2 and H2O, which was 35 percentage of TOC removal after being ozonated for 180 min. Several intermediate oxidation products were observed by UV and HPLC. Organic acids of small molecular were produced in the ozonation, resulting in the decreasing of pH from 5.96 to 3.94. The broken of alachlor structure was verified by the creation of inorganic ions in the ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hai-yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Jiu-hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24S2S61PXL", "NameOfSubstance": "alachlor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetamides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15202232"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
