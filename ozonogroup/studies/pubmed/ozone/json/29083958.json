However, state-of-the-art monitors are costly and may not be compatible with wireless data logging systems. In this study, low-cost electro-chemical sensors manufactured by Alphasense Ltd. for detection of CO and oxidative gases (predominantly O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>) were evaluated. The voltages from three oxidative gas sensors and three CO sensors were recorded every 2.5\u00a0sec when exposed to controlled gas concentrations in a 0.125-m<sup>3</sup> acrylic glass chamber. Electro-chemical sensors for detection of oxidative gases demonstrated sensitivity to both NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> with similar voltages recorded when exposed to equivalent environmental concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> gases, when evaluated separately. There was a strong linear relationship between the recorded voltages and target concentrations of oxidative gases (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.98) over a wide range of concentrations. Although a strong linear relationship was also observed for CO concentrations below 12\u00a0ppm, a saturation effect was observed wherein the voltage only changes minimally for higher CO concentrations (12-50\u00a0ppm). The nonlinear behavior of the CO sensors implied their unsuitability for environments where high CO concentrations are expected. Using a manufacturer-supplied shroud, sensors were tested at 2 different flow rates (0.25 and 0.5 Lpm) to mimic field calibration of the sensors with zero air and a span gas concentration (2\u00a0ppm NO2\u00a0or 15\u00a0ppm CO). As with all electrochemical sensors, the tested devices were subject to drift with a bias up to 20% after 9 months of continuous operation. Alphasense CO sensors were found to be a proper choice for occupational and environmental CO monitoring with maximum concentration of 12\u00a0ppm, especially due to the field-ready calibration capability. Alphasense oxidative gas sensors are usable only if it is valuable to know the sum of the NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health and Engineering , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6337-1824"], "LastName": "Afshar-Mohajer", "ForeName": "Nima", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health and Engineering , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuidema", "ForeName": "Christopher", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Occupational and Environmental Health , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sousan", "ForeName": "Sinan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Occupational and Environmental Health , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hallett", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tatum", "ForeName": "Marcus", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health and Engineering , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rule", "ForeName": "Ana M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Geb", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Occupational and Environmental Health , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1698-8856"], "LastName": "Peters", "ForeName": "Thomas M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health and Engineering , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koehler", "ForeName": "Kirsten", "Initials": "K"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES005605", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 OH010533", "Acronym": "OH", "Agency": "NIOSH CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01OH010533", "Agency": "ACL HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Occup Environ Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "101189458", "ISSNLinking": "1545-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interest.
