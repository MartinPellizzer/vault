It was reduced to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which was treated with several mercaptans to yield compounds of the type 4-(S-R)-mercapto-cyclophosphamide. In the solid state these compounds are stable at room temperature; in aqueous solution they are hydrolyzed to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide or its tautomer, aldophosphamide. One of the 4-(S-R)-mercapto-cyclophosphamide compounds was tested biologically in vitro against Yoshida ascites tumor cells and showed the same cytotoxic activity as 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peter", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hohorst", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Treat Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "7607107", "ISSNLinking": "0361-5960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Mustard Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U880A4FUDA", "NameOfSubstance": "perfosfamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Mustard Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoma, Yoshida"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1277218"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
