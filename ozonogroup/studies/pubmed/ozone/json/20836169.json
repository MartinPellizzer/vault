Treatment of lettuce with citric (5 g L(-1)) and lactic (5 mL L(-1)) acid solutions and ozonated water (4 mg L(-1)) reduced the populations of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria by 1.7 and 1.5 log(10) CFU g(-1) respectively. Organic acid dippings resulted in lower mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts than ozonated water and chlorine dippings during 12 days of storage. Lactic acid dipping effectively reduced (by 2.2 log(10) CFU g(-1)) and maintained low populations of Enterobacteriaceae on lettuce for the first 6 days of storage. No significant (P > 0.05) changes were observed in the texture and moisture content of lettuce samples dipped in chlorine, organic acids and ozonated water during storage.
