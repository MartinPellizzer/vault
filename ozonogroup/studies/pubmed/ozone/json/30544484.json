This can be potentially harmful to the health of not only the healthcare personnel but also patients who undergo endoscopic examinations. However, there has been scarce data on air quality in the endoscopy unit. This study aimed to measure the air quality in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit.", "This is a prospective study using conventional portable passive air quality monitoring sensors in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit. We will check the 6 main indoor air quality indices, as well as the atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity in the endoscopy unit of a single hospital in Korea. These indices are as follows: carbon dioxide (CO2), total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter that has a diameter of <2.5\u200a\u03bcm, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone. The indices will be checked in the endoscopy unit, including the procedural area, recovery area, and area for disinfection and cleansing of equipment, at 1-minute intervals for at least 1 week, and the type and number of endoscopic procedures will also be recorded. The primary outcome of this study is to determine whether the air quality indices exceed safety thresholds and whether there is any association between ambient air pollution and the type and number of endoscopic procedures.", "The results of this study will provide evidence for health-related protective strategies for medical practitioners and patients in the endoscopy unit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of New Frontier Research."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bang", "ForeName": "Chang Seok", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Science, Hallym University College of Medicine, Chuncheon, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Keunwook", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of New Frontier Research."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Jae Ho", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soh", "ForeName": "Jae Seung", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of New Frontier Research."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Ji Young", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baik", "ForeName": "Gwang Ho", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong Joon", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Medicine (Baltimore)", "NlmUniqueID": "2985248R", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7974"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnosis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors disclose no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Han C, Kim S, Lim YH, et al.
