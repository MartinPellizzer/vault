Bintje) induced by season-long elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and/or ozone concentrations are reported. \u2022\u2002 Open-top chambers and unchambered field plots were used to examine crop responses to three CO<sub>2</sub> (ambient, 550 and 680\u00a0\u00b5mol mol<sup>-1</sup> ) and two ozone (ambient and 65\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> , 8\u00a0h\u00a0d<sup>-1</sup> seasonal mean) treatments applied throughout the 105 d growing season. \u2022\u2002 Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increased both above- and below-ground biomass at intermediate and final harvests. Tuber yield at final harvest was increased by c.\u00a040% due to an increase in mean tuber weight rather than tuber number; tuber yield did not differ significantly between the 550 and 680\u00a0\u00b5mol mol<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> treatments. Elevated ozone had no significant effect on growth or yield except for the largest size category of tubers, despite extensive visible foliar injury. Significant CO<sub>2</sub> \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0ozone interactions were detected only for senescent leaf number and green leaf ratio. \u2022\u2002 Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increases biomass and tuber yield in S. tuberosum cv.
