Aging is a ubiquitous phenomenon in MoS<sub>2</sub> and plays a key role in its tribological application for shortening its service life. The effect of the surface and microstructure on the lubricative properties of MoS<sub>2</sub> aging under different environments, including deionized water (DI water), ultraviolet/ozone (UV/Ozone), and high-temperature, was investigated. First, the lubrication of MoS<sub>2</sub> transiently degrades because of physical adsorption and recovers after mechanical removal. The lubrication of MoS<sub>2</sub> also degrades slightly when its surface becomes hydrophilic, thereby enhancing the adhesion energy due to atomic oxygen interaction under UV/Ozone exposure. Second, the lubrication of MoS<sub>2</sub> degrades irreversibly because of the formation of stripes with the destroyed structures under accelerated aging. The lubrication of MoS<sub>2</sub> further degrades with the formation of small triangular pits under high-temperature annealing. Finally, the lubrication of MoS<sub>2</sub> deteriorates due to the destroyed structure and complete oxidation. The severe aging of MoS<sub>2</sub> is accompanied with large triangular pits due to anisotropic oxidation etching of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The lubrication failure of MoS<sub>2</sub> was determined on the basis of structural defect formation and surface property degradation induced by the extent of oxygen diffusion. The enhanced out-of-plane deformation due to the reduced out-of-plane stiffness and the increased energy barriers of defects are fundamentally responsible for the lubrication degradation of MoS<sub>2</sub> at the atomic scale. These findings can provide new insights into the atomic-scale mechanism underlying the lubrication failure of MoS<sub>2</sub> and pave the way for the realization of MoS<sub>2</sub>-based lubrication application under various environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0653-9352"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Xing'an", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center for High Performance Fiber Composites, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Xuehui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "LastName": "Lang", "ForeName": "Haojie", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4951-4657"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center for High Performance Fiber Composites, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yitian", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33645224", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c03512"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
