However, process-based VOC emission and speciation from the printing industry have not been well identified, mainly owing to the poor emission factors (EFs) and diversity of source profiles. In this study, we systematically characterized process-based VOC emissions from the printing industry for the period of 2010-2019, through the establishment of improved emission factors and composite source profiles. VOC emissions from the printing industry were found to continuously increase from 2010 to 2018, reaching their maximum in 2018 at 939.8 Gg, but started to decrease afterwards. The substantial growth is driven by the large demand for ink and adhesive and the absence of effective control measures in the printing industry. The total VOC emissions and ozone formation potential (OFP) in China in 2019 were 916.1 Gg and 1834.5 Gg, respectively. Gravure printing and the compound process were the processes that contributed the most to both emissions and OFP. Rapidly developing provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang were the largest contributors to emissions. Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) accounted for most of the VOC emissions, followed by alkanes and aromatics, while aromatics were the dominant groups for total OFP, followed by alkenes/alkynes and OVOCs. Ethyl acetate, toluene, isopropanol, isopentane, and n-pentane were the top five VOC species in terms of emissions, while toluene, ethyl acetate, 1,3-butadiene, isopentane, and 1-butene were the top five species in terms of OFP. Scientific and precise control policy were proposed, involving four aspects: environmental access, emission standards, classification and management, and research on source substitution. We believe our study will provide an important reference for the systematic characterization and control policy of VOC emissions from other industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
