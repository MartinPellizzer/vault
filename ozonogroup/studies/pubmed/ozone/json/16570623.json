Each substrate is oxidized by ozone with an apparent second-order rate constant, k''(O3,app) > 1 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1), at pH 7, with the exception of N(4)-acetylsulfamethoxazole (K''(O3,app) is 2.5 x 102 M(-1) s(-1)). k''(O3,app) values (pH 7) for macrolides, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline, vancomycin, and amikacin appear to correspond directly to oxidation of biochemically essential moieties. Initial reactions of ozone with N(4)-acetylsulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, lincomycin, and beta-lactams do not lead to appreciable oxidation of biochemically essential moieties. However, ozone oxidizes these moieties within fluoroquinolones and lincomycin via slower reactions. Measured k''(O3,app) values and second-order *OH rate constants, k''(*OH,app) were utilized to characterize pollutant losses during ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluent. These losses were dependent on k''(O3,app), but independent of k''(*OH,app). Ozone doses > or =3 mg/L yielded > or =99% depletion of fast-reacting substrates (K''(O3,app) > 5 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) at pH 7.7. Ten substrates reacted predominantly with ozone; only four were oxidized predominantly by .OH. These results indicate that many antibacterial compounds will be oxidized in wastewater via moiety-specific reactions with ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG), Duebendorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dodd", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buffle", "ForeName": "Marc-Olivier", "Initials": "MO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16570623", "10.1021/es051369x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
