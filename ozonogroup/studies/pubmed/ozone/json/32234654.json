A large quantity of VOCs can be produced in the initial decomposition stage of municipal solid waste (MSW). In this study, the atmosphere in an MSW transfer station was monitored for one year. The emission characteristics of VOCs in different seasons and working hours were analyzed, and the ozone-formation potential of VOCs was calculated through the maximum incremental reaction method, and health risks posed by the VOCs in the MSW transfer station were assessed. The results showed that the highest concentration of VOCs appeared in spring and summer, accounting for 70.6% and 26.6% of total VOCs (TVOCs) in peak working periods, respectively. Oxygenated compounds and terpenes contributed most to ozone formation, accounting for 41.0% and 50.6% of total ozone formation, respectively. The carcinogenic risks were above the safe threshold, labeled \"probable risks\". Tetrachloroethylene and 1,2-dichloroethane were the main contributors to carcinogenic risks. The mean non-carcinogenic risks were within the safe threshold in the MSW transfer station. From the perspective of protecting human health and ecological environmental safety, VOC control needs to be further strengthened in the transfer station."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
