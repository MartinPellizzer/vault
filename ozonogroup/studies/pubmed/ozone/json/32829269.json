Air pollution exposure has been associated with increased inflammatory responses. We hypothesize that endogenous melatonin plays a role in inflammatory responses to air pollution exposure.", "We tested this hypothesis in a cohort of 53 healthy adults (22-52\u00a0years old, 16 women), none of whom were on melatonin supplementation. Early morning urine and fasting blood were collected from each participant longitudinally up to three times. We analyzed urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), as a surrogate of circulating melatonin, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma samples. Indoor and outdoor air pollutants were measured and combined with participants' time-activity patterns to calculate personal exposure to O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> averaged over 12-hour, 24-hour, 1-week, and 2-week periods prior to biospecimen collection, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationships among urinary aMT6s, personal pollutant exposure, and plasma cytokines. A mediation analysis was conducted to examine the role of aMT6s in the relationships between pollutant exposures and inflammatory cytokines.", "One interquartile range (4.2\u00a0ppb) increase in 2-week O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated with a -26.2% (95% CI: -43.9% to -2.8%) decrease in aMT6s. Within the range of endogenous aMT6s concentrations (0.5-53.0\u00a0ng/ng creatinine) across the participants, increased aMT6s was associated with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-17A, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. These cytokines were significantly and positively associated with 2-week average O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Furthermore, 7.4% to 17.4% of the O<sub>3</sub>-cytokine associations were mediated by aMT6s. We did not find similar effects for the other pollutants.", "Pro-inflammatory responses to O<sub>3</sub> exposure in the preceding 2\u00a0weeks partly resulted from the depletion of endogenous melatonin by O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
