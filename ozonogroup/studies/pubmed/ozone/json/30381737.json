However, its high oxidizing potential can induce alterations in foods by acting on the unsaturated fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ozonation on the oxidative stability of chicken breast meat obtained from animals subjected to different feeding strategies.", "Samples were obtained from commercial hybrid chickens (ROSS 508), some of which were nourished with a feed enriched with fats of animal origin, while the lipid source was vegetal for the remaining birds. Samples of meat belonging to both groups were treated with ozone and then analysis was performed to evaluate alterations in physical properties, lipid content, fatty acid profile, and oxidation stability.", "Ozone induced a significant reduction in drip loss in meat samples obtained from animals nourished with vegetable fats; this nutritional strategy also produced meats leaner and richer in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, useful for the assessment of lipid oxidation, were higher in samples obtained from animals fed with vegetable fats with respect to diet based on the addition of animal fats.", "The ozone treatment improved the physical parameters of meat samples obtained from animals fed with vegetable fats, however the same samples showed a higher lipid oxidation compared to what observed in the case of the dietary intake of animal fats, probably as a consequence of the marked increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids which are more susceptible to peroxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Bioscience and Technology for Food, Agriculture and Environment, University of Teramo, Teramo 64100, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ianni", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Bioscience and Technology for Food, Agriculture and Environment, University of Teramo, Teramo 64100, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grotta", "ForeName": "Lisa", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Bioscience and Technology for Food, Agriculture and Environment, University of Teramo, Teramo 64100, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martino", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Rural Development Administration", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Asian-Australas J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9884245", "ISSNLinking": "1011-2367"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</b>.
