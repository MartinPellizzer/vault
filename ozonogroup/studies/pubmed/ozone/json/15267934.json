We report recent results on dissociation and negative ion formation in electron-stimulated desorption (ESD) of CF2Cl2 on Ru(0001), when CF2Cl2 is coadsorbed with a polar molecule (NH3), for electron energies ranging from 50 to 300 eV. Two different time-of-flight methods are used in this investigation: (a) an ESD ion angular distribution detector with wide collection angle and (b) a quadrupole mass spectrometer with narrow collection angle and high mass resolution. Many negative ESD fragments are seen (F-, Cl-, FCl-, CF-, F2-, and Cl2-), whose intensities depend on the surface preparation. Using both detectors we observe a giant enhancement of Cl- and F- yields for ESD of CF2Cl2 coadsorbed with approximately 1 ML of NH3; this enhancement (>10(3) for Cl-) is specific to certain ions, and is attributed to an increased probability of dissociative electron attachment due to \"trapped\" low-energy secondary electrons, i.e., precursor states of the solvated electron in NH3. In further studies, the influence of polar NH3 spacer layers (1-10 ML) on ESD of top-layer CF2Cl2 is determined, and compared with thick films of condensed CF2Cl2. The magnitudes and energy dependences of the Cl- yields are different in these cases, due to several contributing factors."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2004 American Institute of Physics"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and Laboratory for Surface Modification, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854-8019, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solovev", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kusmierek", "ForeName": "D O", "Initials": "DO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madey", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15267934", "10.1063/1.1630296"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
