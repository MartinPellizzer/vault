In order to evaluate the oxidative degradation, PAH measures carried out through collecting airborne particulate with and without ozone denuders were examined. Simultaneously, the influence of volatilization was investigated by comparing concentrations of PAHs in particulate samples collected over 24-h and 12-h using conventional instruments. Summer and winter/spring campaigns were carried out in order to assess the influence of environmental contour on the artifact processes. Oxidative degradation led to a general decrease of PAH concentrations in both periods; in particular, the highest losses were observed for benzo[a]pyrene and perylene reaching, in average, ca. 20%. In the summer, the effect of volatilization exceeded that of oxidative degradation for light PAHs up to benzo[e]pyrene. In the winter/spring time, the influence of both artifact typologies could be mitigated by splitting the normal 24-h collection interval starting at midnight into two 12-h intervals. A mitigation of the losses could even be obtained by fixing the start time sampling fixed at noon or in the first hours of the day. Finally, the feasibility of collecting PAHs through prolonged sampling (>1 month) at the flow rate of 1.1\u00a0L\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> was preliminarily investigated. Results indicated that this approach is unsuitable for minimizing the oxidative artifacts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
