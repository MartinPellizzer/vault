An examination was made on their primary admission. The control group included 470 patients with chronic benign diseases of the studied sites and 205 clinically healthy persons. The study established that the development of a tumor in cancer patients was associated with the structural changes in lipids, which are responsible for a significant reduction in their total unsaturation. The degree of lipid metabolic disturbances depends on the site of a tumor. The most significant disturbances were noted in patients with cancer of the stomach and urinary bladder. The calculated diagnostic criteria of double bonds (DB) corroborate the advisability of determining lipid unsaturation to improve the quality of diagnosis and monitoring of cancer diseases. The loose correlation between DB, lipid peroxidation products, the antioxidant system, and the electron paramagnetic resonance parameter a of spin-labeled serum is a prerequisite for their combined use in order to enhance the efficiency of laboratory diagnosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsyrus'", "ForeName": "T P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prokhorova", "ForeName": "V I", "Initials": "VI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derzhavets", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mashevski\u012d", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lisitsyn", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mashevskaia", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Klin Lab Diagn", "NlmUniqueID": "9432021", "ISSNLinking": "0869-2084"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16875129"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
