The degradation rate was strongly influenced by the ozone dosage, pH, initial concentration of carbofuran and contact time of ozonation. Carbofuran solution of 200ppm concentration was degraded by 79% within 10 minutes consuming 87 mg of ozone at pH 4. The associated TOC reduction was observed to be 53%. Ammonium (20 mg/L) and nitrate (30 mg/L) ions were detected in the effluent as degradation products of ozonation. The results support the effectiveness of ozonation for degradation of organic pesticides such as carbofuran."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Environmental Studies, Anna University, Chennai - 600 025. sundar.suneethi@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suneethi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joseph", "ForeName": "Kurian", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101273917"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SKF77S6Y67", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbofuran"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbofuran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21114166"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
