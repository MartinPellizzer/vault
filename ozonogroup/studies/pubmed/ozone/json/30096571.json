However, little is known about how this related to O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> (weighted value).", "We investigated the effects of redox-weighted oxidant capacity (O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup>) on fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a biomarker of airway inflammation, in a set of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. We also compare combined oxidant capacity (O<sub>x</sub>) and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> in their associations with increasing levels of FeNO.", "We measured FeNO values in 600 participants who have COPD at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. O<sub>x</sub> was calculated directly by the sum of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. The redox-weighted oxidant capacity was calculated by denoting O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> as the weighted average of redox potentials. We applied generalized additive models (GAM) to investigate the impacts of O<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> on FeNO levels, respectively. We fitted the same models for the influence of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> individually and jointly on FeNO levels to compare the result of O<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup>.", "O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> were significantly linked with FeNO levels. The impact was robustest in current day after exposure, and were closely linked with the adjustment of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. A 10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> increase in average O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> concentrations was linked to 0.88 (95% CI:\u00a0-1.46, 3.28) increase, whereas a 10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> increase in average O<sub>x</sub> concentration was linked to 0.62 (95% CI:\u00a0-0.79, 2.07) increase in FeNO. In two-pollutant models, an increase of 10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> in average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations with adjustment of NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with 0.57 (95% CI:\u00a0-1.26, 2.01) increase in FeNO. The impact estimates of O<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> were statistically significant among males, non-smoking and elders who age above 65 years old.", "This analysis demonstrated that O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> is used as a better indicator of atmospheric oxidative capacity as a proxy of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in further epidemiological studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
