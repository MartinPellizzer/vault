In this work, the removal of MC by means of ozonation was studied for the first time, employing a multi-reactor methodology and neutral pH conditions. The second-order rate constants of MC reaction with molecular ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and formed hydroxyl radicals (OH\u00b7) were determined to be 1.7\u00b710<sup>6</sup> and 8.2\u00b710<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. During degradation experiments, direct ozone reaction was observed to effectively remove MC, but not its formed intermediates, whereas OH\u00b7 could oxidize all species. The major identified TPs were methiocarb sulfoxide (MCX), methiocarb sulfoxide phenol (MCXP) and methiocarb sulfone phenol (MCNP), all of them formed through MC oxidation by O<sub>3</sub> or OH\u00b7 in combination with hydrolysis. A toxicity assessment evidenced a strong dependence on MCX concentration, even at very low values. Despite the OH\u00b7 capability to degrade MC and its main metabolites, the relative resistance of TPs towards ozone attack enlarged the oxidant dosage (2.5\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC) necessary to achieve a relatively low toxicity of the medium. Even though ozonation could be a suitable technique for MC removal from water compartments, strategies aimed to further promote the indirect contribution of hydroxyl radicals during this process should be explored."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
