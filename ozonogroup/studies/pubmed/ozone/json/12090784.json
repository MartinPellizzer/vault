We therefore investigated effects of in vivo ozone exposure on intracellular calcium mobilization in relation to tracheal smooth muscle contractility in the guinea pig in vitro. Guinea pigs underwent ozone exposure or sham exposure (3 ppm, 2 h). Then, a tracheal smooth muscle strip was mounted in an organ bath to record isometric tension. Effects of ozone exposure on acetylcholine-induced contraction of smooth muscle were as follows. Contraction was not altered in normal Krebs solution, but was increased in Ca(2+)-free solution in ozone-exposed animals. Decline of tension on repetitive application of acetylcholine in Ca(2+)-free solution was reduced, while the tension decline rate while acetylcholine was washed out with Ca(2+)-free solution was facilitated in ozone-exposed animals. Tension decline during the continuous administration of acetylcholine in Ca(2+)-free solution was slowed. Contraction occurred more quickly in Ca(2+)-free solution in ozone-exposed animals. Results suggest that ozone has a direct action on airway smooth muscle by changing Ca(2+) mobilization; Ca(2+) refilling via a Ca(2+) pump and Ca(2+) release via Ca(2+) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum were increased, while Ca(2+) extrusion via the plasma membrane Ca(2+) pump was unchanged."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Diseases of the Chest, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashiku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aizawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakano", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Komori", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukuyama", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pulm Pharmacol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9715279", "ISSNLinking": "1094-5539"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12090784", "10.1006/pupt.2001.0324", "S1094553901903244"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
