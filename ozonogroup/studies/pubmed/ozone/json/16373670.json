Responses to ozone (O(3)), an asthma trigger, are increased in obese (ob/ob) mice lacking the satiety hormone leptin. The long form of leptin receptor (Ob-R(b)) is required for satiety; mice lacking this receptor (db/db mice) are also substantially obese. Here, wild-type (WT) and db/db mice were exposed to air or O(3) (2 ppm) for 3 h. Airway responsiveness, measured by the forced oscillation technique, was greater in db/db than WT mice after air exposure. O(3)-induced increases in pulmonary resistance and airway responsiveness were also greater in db/db mice. BALF eotaxin, IL-6, KC, and MIP-2 increased 4 h after O(3) exposure and subsided by 24 h, whereas protein and neutrophils continued to increase through 24 h. For each outcome, the effect of O(3) was significantly greater in db/db than WT mice. Previously published results obtained in ob/ob mice were similar except for O(3)-induced neutrophils and MIP-2, which were not different from WT mice. O(3) also induced pulmonary IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in db/db but not ob/ob mice. Leptin was increased in serum of db/db mice, and pulmonary mRNA expression of short form of leptin receptor (Ob-R(a)) was similar in db/db and WT mice. These data confirm obese mice have innate airway hyperresponsiveness and increased pulmonary responses to O(3). Differences between ob/ob mice, which lack leptin, and db/db mice, which lack Ob-R(b) but not Ob-R(a), suggest leptin, acting through Ob-R(a), can modify some pulmonary responses to O(3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology Program, Dept. of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115-6021, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Frank L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "Richard A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flynt", "ForeName": "Lesley", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Theman", "ForeName": "Todd A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Terry", "ForeName": "Raya D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartzman", "ForeName": "Igor N", "Initials": "IN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shore", "ForeName": "Stephanie A", "Initials": "SA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES 00002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES 013307", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL 33009", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100901229", "ISSNLinking": "1040-0605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Leptin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency"], "DescriptorName": "Leptin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Mutant Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Physiological Phenomena"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16373670", "10.1152/ajplung.00386.2005", "00386.2005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
