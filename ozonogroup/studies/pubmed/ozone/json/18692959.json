The concentrations of HAAs were analyzed at specified time intervals to elucidate the decomposition of HAAs. Single O(3) or UV did not result in perceptible decomposition of HAAs within the applied reaction time. O(3)/UV showed to be more suitable for the decomposition of DCAA and TCAA in water among the six methods of oxidation. Decomposition of DCAA was easier than TCAA by AOPs. For O(3)/UV in the semi-continuous mode, the effective utilization rate of ozone for HAA decomposition decreased with ozone addition. The kinetics of HAAs decomposition by O(3)/UV and the influence of coexistent humic acids and HCO(3)(-) on the decomposition process were investigated. The decomposition of the HAAs by the O(3)/UV accorded with the pseudo-first-order mode under the constant initial dissolved O(3) concentration and fixed UV radiation. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the decomposition of DCAA was more than four times that for TCAA. Humic acids can cause the H(2)O(2) accumulation and the decrease in rate constants of HAAs decomposition in the O(3)/UV process. The rate constants for the decomposition of DCAA and TCAA decreased by 41.1% and 23.8%, respectively, when humic acids were added at a concentration of 1.2mgTOC/L. The rate constants decreased by 43.5% and 25.9%, respectively, at an HCO(3)(-) concentration of 1.0mmol/L."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Education Ministry Key Laboratory of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region's Eco-Environment, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400045, PR China. wangkunping2002@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kunping", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jinsong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Junji", "ForeName": "Hirotsuji", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Rongsen", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18692959", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.06.012", "S0304-3894(08)00880-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
