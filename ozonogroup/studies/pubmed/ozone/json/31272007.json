The synthesized catalyst was characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS, H<sub>2</sub>-TPR, etc. Fe-Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub> exhibited a regular spherical shape and had the surface area at 1216\u202fm<sup>2</sup>\u202fg<sup>-1</sup>. The wrapping of metal components and their strong interaction prevented metal leaching. Fe-Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub> showed the highest activity for SA mineralization when compared with Fe@SiO<sub>2</sub> and Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub>. In Fe-Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>, 88% TOC was removed, which was 2.5 times as much as that in sole ozonation. SA degradation efficiency in Fe-Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> increased with initial pH. O<sub>3</sub>, \u00b7OH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were the main reactive oxygen species accounting for SA mineralization. Due to their scavenging effect of \u00b7OH, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and humic acids would inhibit the degradation efficiency of Fe-Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>. Acidic sites, oxygen vacancies and the Fe-Cu(I/II) electron transfer were responsible for ozone decomposition and \u00b7OH generation. SA mineralization proceeded through the \u00b7OH mechanism. Moreover, SA mineralization in O<sub>3</sub> and Fe-Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> both exhibited a two-stage pseudo first-order kinetics (stage I: 0-45\u202fmin; stage II: 45-120\u202fmin). The degradation intermediates were detected to investigate the reaction pathway. ORP and EEM were used to monitor the degradation process. Great difference was found for carboxylic acids accumulation in O<sub>3</sub> and Fe-Cu@SiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>. The accelerated removal of oxalic acid and humic acid-like intermediates were responsible for the two-stage pseudo first-order kinetics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
