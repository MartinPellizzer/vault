Aniline solutions were ozonated at low and high pH, so as to compare both molecular and hydroxyl free radical mechanisms, respectively. The main identified aromatic by-products were nitrobenzene and azobenzene when the experiment was carried out at acid pH. Formation of nitrobenzene, azobenzene, azoxybenzene and 2-pyridine-carboxylic was observed when the ozonation was carried out at basic pH. p-Chloroaniline was treated with ozone only at high pH and the identified by-products were in accordance with those obtained in the ozonation of aniline: p-chloronitrobenzene, 4,4'-dichloroazobenzene and 4-chloro-2-pyridine-carboxylic acid. All the aromatic by-products found were less toxic than the raw materials. The pseudo-first-order constants in aniline concentration were calculated, whilst kinetic in p-chloroaniline concentration could not be adjusted to a first-order reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Technology, University of Zaragoza, Spain. jsarasa@posta.unizar.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarasa", "ForeName": "Judith", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cort\u00e9s", "ForeName": "Susana", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ormad", "ForeName": "Pe\u00f1ia", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gracia", "ForeName": "Raquel", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ovelleiro", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Luis", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SIR7XX2F1K", "NameOfSubstance": "aniline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z553SGH315", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chloroaniline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12171402", "10.1016/s0043-1354(02)00003-9", "S0043-1354(02)00003-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
