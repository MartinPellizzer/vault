Both pretreatments impact on the recovered lipids quality, solvent waste production and extraction time is analysed for process intensification purposes. For ultrasound pretreatment, independent parameters were energy applied (50-200\u202fkWh/kg dry biomass), biomass concentration (25-75\u202fg/L), and ultrasonic intensity (0.32 and 0.53\u202fW/mL). While for ozone pretreatment, independent parameters were ozone concentration (3-9\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/L), biomass concentration (25-75\u202fg/L), and contact time (5-15\u202fmin). In the case of ultrasound pretreatment, recovery yield reached 97\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4%, 89\u202f\u00b1\u202f3%, and 73\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6% for proteins, carbohydrates and lipids respectively. Given process required: energy applied of 50\u202fkWh/kg dry biomass, 75\u202fg/L of biomass concentration, 0.32\u202fW/mL of ultrasonic intensity, and 56\u202fmin of time process. Ultrasound caused high cell disruption releasing all proteins, thereby obviating downstream processing for its recovery. Ozone pretreatment recovery yield was 85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2%, 48\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.4%, and 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.3%, for carbohydrates, lipids and proteins respectively, under the following conditions: 9\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/L of ozone concentration, 25\u202fg/L of biomass concentration, and 5\u202fmin of contact time that depicts an energy consumption of 30.64\u202fkWh/kg dry biomass. It was found that ultrasound and ozone pretreatments intensified the lysis and biocomponents recovery process by reducing solvent consumption by at least 92% and extraction time between 80% and 90% compared with extraction of untreated biomass biocomponents. Both pretreatments improve the composition of the recovered lipids. It was noted that the yield of neutral lipids increased from 28% to 67% for ultrasound pretreatment while for ozone pretreatment from 49% to 63%. The method used for lipid extraction may also have an effect but here it was kept constant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
