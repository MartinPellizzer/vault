This study applied an ozonation-and-biostimulation process to remove TCE from groundwater. The substrate used, denoted as Transferred Energy Element (TEE), was composed of natural organic materials and had a low viscosity (2.914\u00a0cP). Ten batch experiments were conducted through the application of micro-nano bubbles (MNBs) and substrates (TEE and EOS\u00ae [emulsified oil substrate]). MNBs with an average diameter of 157.5-180.8\u00a0nm effectively degraded TCE and dichloroethane within 6\u00a0min. Biostimulation using the TEE substrate effectively degraded both TCE and vinyl chloride pollutants and reached a steady state after 25 days. The two-stage dechlorination procedure with MNB treatment as the first stage enhanced TCE removal via biostimulation. MNBs reduced the TCE concentration in the first 20\u00a0min, but increased the chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) concentration over the following five days (\u223c80\u00a0mg/L). The procedure with biostimulation as the first stage and 20\u00a0min ozonation as the second stage reduced the Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration by \u223c10\u00a0mg/L. The Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations rebounded after day 25 in the EOS environment. X-ray diffraction revealed that the released Na<sup>+</sup> from the TEE settled with Cl<sup>-</sup> as minerals in the soil. The novel two-stage method for TCE removal was found to be more effective than solo MNB treatment or biostimulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
