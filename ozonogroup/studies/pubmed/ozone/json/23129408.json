A total of 77 tethersonde soundings were taken during the 27-day campaign. The surface ozone concentrations measured by ozonesondes and TEI 49C showed good agreement, albeit with temporal difference between the two instruments. Two case studies of nocturnal secondary ozone maxima are discussed in detail. The development of the low-level jet played a critical role leading to the observed ozone peak concentrations in nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). The maximum of surface ozone was 161.7\u00a0ppbv during the campaign, which could be attributed to abundant precursors storage near surface layer at nighttime. Vertical distribution of ozone was also measured utilizing conventional continuous analyzers on 325-m meteorological observation tower. The results showed the NBL height was between 47 and 280\u00a0m, which were consistent with the balloon data. Southerly air flow could bring ozone-rich air to Beijing, and the ozone concentrations exceeded the China's hourly ozone standard (approximately 100\u00a0ppb) above 600\u00a0m for more than 12\u00a0h."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing, 100089, People's Republic of China. mazhqsos@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zhiqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Honghui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoling", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Quan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuesi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2007 Apr;127(1-3):253-70", "ArticleIdList": ["16927191"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23129408", "10.1007/s10661-012-2958-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
