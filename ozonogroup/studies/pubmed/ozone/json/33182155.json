The obtained results show that there was an optimum dosage of the rGO-WO<sub>3</sub> (40\u00a0mg/L) as well as the preparation conditions (5:1000 mass ratio of the GO and the WO<sub>3</sub>, 18\u00a0h reaction time and 120\u00a0\u00b0C reaction temperature) for achieving the highest catalytic effect, and the highest degradation rate constant of the BPA was 0.03129 min<sup>-1</sup>. The determined higher TOC removal, higher COD removal as well as UV-Vis analysis also demonstrated the catalysis of the rGO-WO<sub>3</sub>. The measurement of the change of the O<sub>3</sub> and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the reaction system with or without the rGO-WO<sub>3</sub> and with or without the BPA proved the catalysis of the rGO-WO<sub>3</sub> on the \u00b7OH formation, while the combination of the GO had the positive effect for enhancing the catalytic effect. A figure on the catalysis and degradation procedure of the BPA in the DBDP/rGO-WO<sub>3</sub> system was provided in the paper."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
