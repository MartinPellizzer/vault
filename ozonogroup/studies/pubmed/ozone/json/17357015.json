Five trees were exposed to a twice ambient ozone regime (2 x O(3)) with a free-air canopy exposure system throughout the seasons and five trees under the prevailing ambient ozone regime served as controls (1 x O(3)). In order to examine chronic ozone (O(3)) effects, leaf samples from the sun and shade crowns of the trees were analyzed five times throughout the growing seasons in 2003 and 2004. Sucrose concentrations of leaves collected in 2004 were consistently lower than those taken in 2003, regardless of the O(3) treatment and crown position. However, the opposite was found for starch. O(3) caused a reduction of sucrose and starch contents of sun leaves in both years. Due to the fact that O(3)-responsiveness depends on the O(3) uptake through stomata during the season, all carbohydrate data were related to the cumulative O(3) uptake (COU). Little differences were found comparing sucrose and starch contents in leaves of trees grown under ambient or elevated O (3) regimes, possibly indicating the high capacity of leaves of adult beech to cope with rising O(3) exposure. Even under 2 x O(3), leaves were still able to regulate the O(3) intake by narrowing their stomata at the cost of CO(2)-uptake and sugar synthesis. In order to clarify whole-tree response patterns carbohydrate data were compared with photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and electron transport rates. In 2004 all parameters revealed a significant common response pattern to COU that indicated a reduction for all parameters under 2 x O(3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytopathology of Woody Plants, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Am Hochanger 13, 85354 Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany. blumenroether@wzw.tum.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blumenr\u00f6ther", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f6w", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osswald", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17357015", "10.1055/s-2006-924565"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
