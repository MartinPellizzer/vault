Ozone exposure- and flux-response relationships for tree biomass are used for regional O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment. In order to investigate whether soil N addition affects stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake of poplar, poplar saplings were exposed to treatment combinations of five O<sub>3</sub> levels and four N addition levels. High N addition treatment reduced the accumulated stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake in the leaf due to reduced maximum stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>). Nitrogen addition also significantly reduced the steady-state light-saturated g<sub>s</sub> in August and September. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly reduced and N addition increased total plant biomass; however, there were no significant O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0N interactions. The slopes of biomass-based O<sub>3</sub> exposure- and flux-response relationships did not differ significantly among N treatments. The critical levels for a 5% biomass reduction were estimated at 15.4\u00a0ppm\u00a0h and 17.1\u00a0mmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> projected leaf area (PLA) for Accumulated O<sub>3</sub> exposure Over an hourly Threshold of 40\u00a0ppb (AOT40) and Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a threshold 1\u00a0nmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> PLA s<sup>-1</sup> (POD<sub>1</sub>). These results can facilitate the evaluations of O<sub>3</sub> effect on the carbon-sink capacity and productivity of forest."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
