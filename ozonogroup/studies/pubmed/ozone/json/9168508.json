Ozone half-hour mean concentrations were measured continuously and pulmonary function was tested in each child on four occasions (April, June, August, and September). To obtain an average short-term ozone effect, we first analyzed the data from the four time points separately and then constructed a model that included all information. During the study period the median (5th to 95th percentile) of all half-hour values of the ozone concentration was 101 micrograms/m3 or 50.6 ppb (45-179 micrograms/m3 or 22.5-89.8 ppb) in Freudenstadt and 64 micrograms/m3 or 32.1 ppb (1 to 140 micrograms/m3 or 0.5-70.1 ppb) in Villingen. To assess the effects of an individual ozone exposure we related the highest ozone concentration in the respective 24 hours before lung function testing to the results of the subconcentration in the respective 24 hours before lung function testing to the results of the subsequent pulmonary function tests. In the lung function test following the highest ozone exposure, the results of our cross-sectional linear regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (P = 0.0181) between ozone exposure and forced vital capacity (FVC). In the longitudinal linear regression model we observed a negative statistical correlation between ozone exposure and lung function for the subpopulation living in the town with the high ozone levels (Freudenstadt). The association was more pronounced in boys than girls. For the children in Freudenstadt the decrement of FVC was -12.31 ml/10 micrograms/m3 ozone and the decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was -11.29 ml/10 micrograms/m3 ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital, Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ulmer", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kopp", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ihorst", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frischer", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forster", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuehr", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pediatr Pulmonol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510590", "ISSNLinking": "1099-0496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9168508", "10.1002/(sici)1099-0496(199705)23:5<344::aid-ppul6>3.0.co;2-k", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-0496(199705)23:5<344::AID-PPUL6>3.0.CO;2-K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
