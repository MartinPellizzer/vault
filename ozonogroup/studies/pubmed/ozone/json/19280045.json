The annual mean concentrations of GEM, P-Hg < 2.5 and RGM were 4.5 +/- 3.1 ng m(-3) (99.2%), 21.5 +/- 16.4 pg m(-3) (0.5%) and 14.2 +/- 13.2 pg m(-3) (0.3%), respectively. The concentrations for all the measured Hg species were highly variable throughout the year and were lower in winter than in the other three seasons. The maximum concentrations of Hg species were observed in June and were a result of the high number of Hg spikes (using [GEM] >10 ng m(-3) as an indicator) that occurred in the month. Nighttime (between 9pm-6am) concentrations of Hg species were higher than those of daytime. The results revealed: (1) an urban area is a continuous source of Hg species that have the potential to pose impacts on local, regional and global scales; (2) local/regional anthropogenic sources contributed significantly to the levels and the distributions of the Hg species in the urban atmosphere. More studies are needed to identify and quantify the anthropogenic sources of Hg and the Hg species emitted from these sources; (3) surface emission and photochemical reactions (including the reactions involving ozone) did not have significant influence on the levels of Hg species and their distribution in the urban atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biology, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Xinjie", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Irene", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ontario"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19280045", "10.1039/b815435j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
