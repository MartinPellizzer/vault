Herein, a novel ozone-activated cataluminescence (CTL) sensor system based on silica nanospheres was developed for highly sensitive and fast quantification of dichloroalkanes. A typical CTL system coupled with a plasma-ozone-assist unit was designed for promoting the CTL response of dichloroalkanes. The ozone generated by plasma provides a new pathway of catalytic oxidation process, which accompanied by the CTL signal amplification of dichloroalkanes results in an enhanced CTL sensor system with improved limit of detection (1,2-dichloroethane: 0.04 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>, 1,2-dichloropropane: 0.03 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>) and benign selective performance under the interference of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CS<sub>2</sub>, and other common CVOCs. Moreover, a segmented CTL mechanism including co-adsorption of ozone and dichloroalkanes, thermal elimination, the ozonation route, and a luminous step was ratiocinated based on multiple characterizations and discussion. The proposed methodology and theory open up an attractive perspective for the analysis of less active volatile organic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry & Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Chudong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9661-8371"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry & Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Hongjie", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry & Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Zili", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4441-2176"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry & Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lichun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry & Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7104-2414"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical & Testing Center, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Sens", "NlmUniqueID": "101669031", "ISSNLinking": "2379-3694"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanospheres"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34269056", "10.1021/acssensors.1c00369"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
