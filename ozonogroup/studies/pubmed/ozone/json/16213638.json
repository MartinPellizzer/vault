Plants were classified as either ozone-sensitive or insensitive based on the amount of foliar injury. Sensitive plants developed injury earlier in the season and to a greater extent than insensitive plants. Older leaf cohorts were more likely to belong to high injury classes by the end of each of the two growing seasons. In addition, leaf loss was more likely for older cohorts (2000) and lower leaf positions (2001) than younger cohorts and upper leaves, respectively. Most leaves abscised without prior ozone-like stippling or chlorosis. Failure to take this into account can result in underestimation of the effects of ozone on these plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, 572 Rivers Street, Appalachian State University, Boone, NC 28608, USA. lsouza@utk.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Lara", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neufeld", "ForeName": "Howard S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chappelka", "ForeName": "Arthur H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burkey", "ForeName": "Kent O", "Initials": "KO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davison", "ForeName": "Alan W", "Initials": "AW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asclepias"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North Carolina"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16213638", "10.1016/j.envpol.2005.07.022", "S0269-7491(05)00426-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
