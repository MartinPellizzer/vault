The results showed that there was an obvious \"Weekend Effect\" in northern suburb of Nanjing. The mass concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> on weekdays were higher than those on weekends, whereas mass concentrations of its precursors were higher on the weekends; The average mass concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> were 19.84 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, 53.45 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, 57.17 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and 40.43 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in winter, spring, summer, and autumn respectively. Compared with other seasons, \"Weekend Effect \" was more distinct in spring. The value of NO<sub>2</sub>/NO was 4.81% higher on weekdays (3.63) than on weekends (3.46). The longer cumulative time and higher accumulation rate of O<sub>3</sub>, and the stronger atmospheric oxidation capacity on weekdays were responsible for the higher O<sub>3</sub> mass concentrations on weekdays. The correlation coefficients of the mass concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> with VOCs, NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>, NO, and NO<sub>2</sub> were higher on weekdays than on weekends."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education(KLME), Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jun-Xiu", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education(KLME), Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jun-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education(KLME), Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education(KLME), Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Jia-Nan", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Environmental Monitoring Center Station, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education(KLME), Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965341", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201607226"]}}]}
