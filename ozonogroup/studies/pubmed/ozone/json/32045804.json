In this study, pre-ozonation was proposed to alleviate the negative effects of DOM on UV-based AOPs. After ozone treatment of DOM-containing water at ozone dosages of 0.1-1\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC, the degradation rate of benzoic acid (BA) in UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process increased by 7-34% mainly due to the enhanced transmission of UV light. The degradation rate of BA in UV/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2-</sup> process varied from -11% to 25% at ozone dosages of 0.1-1\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC because of the increased photolysis rate of S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2-</sup> and the altered reactivity of DOM towards SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. Pre-ozonation of DOM at ozone dosage of 1 mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC enhanced the oxidation rate of BA in UV/chlorine process by 35% due to the increased rate of chlorine photolysis and the decreased reactivity of DOM towards Cl. The influence of pre-ozonation on the formation potential of disinfection by-products (DBPs) depends on the kind of AOPs and the species of DBPs. The energy cost analysis suggests that pre-ozonation of DOM is an economic process for enhancing pollutant abatement by UV-based AOPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
