We compared and analyzed the composition, seasonal variation, and diurnal variation of VOCs. Using maximum incremental reactivity (MIR), we estimated the ozone generation potential (OFP) of VOCs. The results show that the annual average volume fraction of atmospheric VOCs in Ezhou is (30.78\u00b115.89)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and is overall higher in winter than summer, represented by alkane > oxygen > halogenated hydrocarbon > olefin > aromatic hydrocarbon > alkyne. The night volume fraction is higher than in the daytime, and overall the distribution is \"double peak\". The aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and OVOCs appear as a \"third peak\" at 00:00-02:00. Aromatic hydrocarbons and olefins contribute more to the OFP potential of VOCs, with contribution rates of 35.45% and 29.5%, respectively. The highest contribution rate to OFP is ethylene, reaching 24.217%. Analysis of VOC characteristic species found that vehicle exhaust fumes and solvent volatilization are the main sources of VOCs in Ezhou. Of these, motor vehicle emissions are the most important source. Controlling Ezhou's motor vehicle emissions helps to reduce the composition of atmospheric VOCs, thereby reducing ozone production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yu-Meng", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Hong-Gang", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Min-Yu", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Jia-Xin", "Initials": "JX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608608", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201908112"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
