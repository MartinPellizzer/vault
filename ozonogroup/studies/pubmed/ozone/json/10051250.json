Twenty-one healthy and 15 asthmatic subjects participated in the study. One hour after the two exposures to 250 ppb ozone we observed a mean increase in sputum neutrophils of 17.9 and 17.9% in healthy and of 20.3 and 15.2% in asthmatic subjects (p < 0.05 each). Twenty-four hours after exposure, the respective values were 11.9 and 14.8%, and 9.1 and 16.1% (p < 0.05 each). In the whole group of subjects, individual changes in the percentage of neutrophils were significantly correlated between the two exposure days 1 h (r = 0.87, p < 0.001; intraclass correlation coefficient [Ri] = 0.86) as well as 24 h (r = 0.79, p < 0.001; Ri = 0.71) after exposure. The percentages of lymphocytes were increased 24 h after exposures (all subjects combined: p < 0.05). The decrease in FEV1 in both groups (p < 0.01), was also reproducible (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), but there were no correlations between changes in sputum parameters and lung function. Exposure to 125 ppb ozone caused a small increase (p < 0. 05) in the percentage of neutrophils in asthmatic subjects and in the concentrations of interleukin-8 in both groups combined. Our data demonstrate that inflammatory and lung function responses to ozone differ between individuals and are reproducible but not related to each other. Therefore, these responses appear to represent two independent factors underlying the airway response to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Krankenhaus Grosshansdorf, Zentrum f\u00fcr Pneumologie und Thoraxchirurgie, LVA Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg, Grosshansdorf, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holz", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00f6rres", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Timm", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fccke", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richter", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koschyk", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magnussen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Sputum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10051250", "10.1164/ajrccm.159.3.9806098"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
