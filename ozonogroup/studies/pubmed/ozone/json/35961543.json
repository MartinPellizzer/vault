For the fair validation, ozonesonde profiles are smoothed using the weighting function of each satellite retrieval algorithm (i.e., convolution process). Compared with limb-viewing MLS and OMPS ozone profiles, the OMI ozone profiles are relatively less qualified: coarser vertical resolution and larger inter-annual variation. Nevertheless, our validation reveals that the quality of all three satellite ozone profiles looks comparable; In general, difference from ozonesonde profile is \u223c1\u00a0ppm absolutely, and -20 to 30% relatively at maximum. This quantitative range well corresponds to previous work, meaning that our new validation confirms the reliability of satellite ozone profiles in the southeastern Antarctic region where the measurement data for the validation were not enough. Another interesting feature is the role of a priori ozone profile; Nadir-viewing OMI satellite can have qualified ozone profiles by a proper assumption of a priori ozone profile. Since the performance of limb-viewing ozone profiles is better, however, the careful usage of nadir-viewing ozone profile is still required. We think that the simultaneous usage of multiple satellite ozone profiles can contribute to better understanding of Antarctic ozone characteristics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
