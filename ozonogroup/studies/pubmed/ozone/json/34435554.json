We studied associations between FeNO and respiratory symptoms, reported diagnosed allergies and indoor and outdoor environmental factors in first grade junior high school students (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009270) in upper northern Thailand.", "Data on demographics, health and home environment were collected by a questionnaire distributed in dry season (February-March 2018). FeNO was measured when the research team visited the school. Daily outdoor pollution data (PM<sub>10</sub> and ozone) were collected from the nearest monitoring station 3\u2009days (lag 3) and 7\u2009days (lag 7) before the FeNO measurements. Two-level (student, school) linear mixed models were used to analyze associations, adjusting for gender and family education level.", "In total, 29.6% had elevated FeNO level (>20\u2009ppb) and 7.8% reported any allergy diagnosed by a doctor. Male gender (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.02), diagnosed allergy (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001), especially to cat (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001) and house dust mite (HDM) allergies (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001) were associated with FeNO. Eye symptoms (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.01), rhinitis symptoms (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.03) and dyspnea (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.05) in the last 3\u2009days were associated with FeNO. Household indoor mold (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.03), gas cooking (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.03) and PM<sub>10</sub> (lag 3 and lag 7) were negatively (protective) associated with FeNO.", "Diagnosed allergy, especially to cat and HDM, can be associated with increased FeNO. Indoor mold and gas cooking can be associated with lower FeNO. Ocular, nasal and dyspnea symptoms reported by students in dry season in northern Thailand can be associated with FeNO, a biomarker of Th2 driven airway inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Prapamontol", "ForeName": "Tippawan", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Norb\u00e4ck", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Thongjan", "ForeName": "Nathaporn", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Suwannarin", "ForeName": "Neeranuch", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Somsunun", "ForeName": "Kawinwut", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Ponsawansong", "ForeName": "Pitakchon", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Khuanpan", "ForeName": "Tosabhorn", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Kawichai", "ForeName": "Sawaeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Public Health, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Naksen", "ForeName": "Warangkana", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breath Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dyspnea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Home Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34435554", "10.1080/02770903.2021.1968424"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
