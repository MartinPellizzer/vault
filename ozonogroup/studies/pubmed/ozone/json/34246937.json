Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) addition could effectively control the formation of bromate. However, the bromate depression performance would be impacted by water qualities. In this study, typical source water containing bromide in eastern China was selected to investigate bromate depression effect under different organic matter, ammonia and bromide concentrations during the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> process. The results display that organic matter, ammonia and bromide concentration could influence the formation of bromate significantly. As tyrosine was applied to increase the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of source water by 2.0 and 3.0\u00a0mg/L, the total concentration of bromate produced decreased gradually as the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (g/g) doses increased from 0 to 1.0 and bromate concentration could be controlled below 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (g/g) was 0.5 and 1.0. As ammonia concentration increased by 0.1 and 0.5\u00a0mg/L, lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (g/g) doses would lead to an increase in bromate generation. As more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added in water, the bromate formation would be suppressed. The increase of bromide concentration induced higher bromate formation. When the bromide concentration increased by 50 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/L, bromate concentration was 10.7\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 41.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L respectively at the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (g/g) of 1.0, higher than the standard level. As 200\u00a0\u03bcg/L of bromide was added to the water, bromate concentration increased significantly and then decreased as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (g/g) increased and more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would be needed for bromate control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
