A HILIC LC column was used for PL class separation, while the further molecular species separation of each PL class was achieved by using online HILIC \u00d7 C18 LC. The double bond positions along the fatty acyl chains of these PL molecular species were also obtained by using the combination of 2D-LC and in-line ozonolysis-MS analysis. The ozonolysis device is composed of a gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable Teflon tube passing through a glass chamber filled with ozone gas, which is then placed in-line between the 2D-LC and the mass spectrometer. The eluting PL molecules in the LC mobile phase passed through the device where they rapidly reacted with the ozone that penetrated through the tubing wall. The ozonolysis products were then detected by MS in real-time, which allowed the localization of the double bonds along the fatty acyl chains in these PL molecular species. This comprehensive method was successfully applied to an egg yolk PL extract, which revealed the detailed structures of the PL molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agriculture/Forestry Center 4-10, Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta , Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2P5, Canada."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chenxing", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Curtis", "ForeName": "Jonathan M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Egg Yolk"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25607811", "10.1021/jf5049595"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
