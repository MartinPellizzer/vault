The reaction of CI with alkenes is found to depend strongly on the substitutions in the reactants, resulting in significant differences in the predicted rate coefficient as a function of the selected alkene and CI. Despite submerged barriers, these entropically disfavored reactions are not expected to affect CI chemistry. The reaction of H2COO + H2COO is found to be barrierless, with a rate coefficient nearing the collision limit, \u22654 \u00d7 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The dominant reaction products are expected to be carbonyl compounds and an oxygen molecule, though chemically activated reactions may give rise to a plethora of different (per)acids and carbonyl compounds. CI + CI reactions are expected to be important only in laboratory environments with high CI concentrations. The reaction of H2COO with O3 was predicted to proceed through a pre-reactive complex and a submerged barrier, with a rate coefficient of 1 \u00d7 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). A study of the dominant CI reactions under experimental and atmospheric conditions shows that the latter reaction might affect CI chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Hahn-Meitner-Weg 1, 55128 Mainz, Germany.
