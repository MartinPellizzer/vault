Methyl bromide (MB) is a fumigant used for quarantine and preshipment (QPS) that can eradicate target pests with short fumigation periods. However, MB, which is an ozone-depleting substance, is scheduled to be phased out in South Korea over the next decade. There is no ideal alternative fumigant to replace MB for QPS of perishable commodities. A laboratory study was conducted to compare the individual effects of EF and PH<sub>3</sub> individually, and the effects of EF mixed with PH<sub>3</sub> as an MB alternative for the control of P. citri adults, nymphs, and eggs. In comparison to treatments with EF and PH<sub>3</sub> individually, EF mixed with PH<sub>3</sub> resulted in high toxicity to all stages of P. citri. The eggs were more tolerant than the nymphs and adults. A mixed treatment of EF and PH<sub>3</sub> achieved complete control of eggs infesting pineapples at concentrations of 25.1/1.0 (EF/PH<sub>3</sub>) mg/liter at 8\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009h of exposures. This new combined EF/PH<sub>3</sub> fumigation technology could offer shorter exposure times and less damage to perishable commodities at low temperatures, and could potentially be extended to controlling other quarantine pests as a replacement treatment for fruit and vegetables in which methyl bromide is currently being used."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Authors 2016.
