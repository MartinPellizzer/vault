Debromination efficiency of 2,4,6-TBP was the highest in basic water (pH\u202f=\u202f10.61). The extent of TOC removal compared favourably with the amount of substrate converted, suggesting favourable mineralization of oxygenated by-products (OBPs). Ozonation in basic water favoured the formation of toxicBrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, while in acidic water (pH\u202f=\u202f2.27) BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> yield was lowest. In acidic water the presence of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> showed negligible effect on conversion, TOC and \u2009BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> yield compared to ozonation alone. In basic water both 2,4,6-TBP conversion and TOC removal decreased with an increase in CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, hence minimizing BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation. The O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process showed an improvement in the debromination efficiency and TOC data revealed that total mineralization of OBP's was achieved. However, only 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was able to effectively decrease BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation. Increasing the ozone concentration from 20 to 100\u202fppm enhanced the conversion of 2,4,6-TBP and TOC removal. At low ozone concentrations poor mineralization of OBP's occurred, while complete mineralization was achieved at higher ozone dose. The reaction pathways for ozone degradation of 2,4,6-TBP in acidic and basic waters is proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
