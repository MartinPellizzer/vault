The gradual decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the infiltration basins at RIX has been attributed to the accumulation of organic matter in the surface sand. Periodic tillage of the surface sand to restore the permeability has mixed this organic matter to a depth of nearly 50 cm. We hypothesized that in situ chemical oxidation of the surface sand might improve the infiltration rate and increase the time between filling and drying cycles. The effect of organic matter oxidation on sand permeability was tested in laboratory sand columns treated with sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochorite, and ozone gas. All oxidants significantly decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the surface sand. The loss in permeability was attributed to an increase in dispersed clay plus silt-sized particles that were released as a result of oxidation. This study suggests that ex situ sand-washing operations, currently being used to clean the sand, could be improved by the addition of oxidants to the wash water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, University of California, Riverside, USA. amrhein@ucr.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amrhein", "ForeName": "Christopher", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alder", "ForeName": "Jay R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "Robert C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Housel", "ForeName": "Valerie K", "Initials": "VK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Silicates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T1FAD4SS2M", "NameOfSubstance": "Clay"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Silicates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15338698", "10.2175/106143004x141825"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
