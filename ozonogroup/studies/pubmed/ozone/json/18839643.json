The oxum (superoxidised water) is a pH neutral, non-irritating, aqueous solution that possesses a good antiseptic, antimicrobial activity and wound healing properties. The study was conducted in 30 patients of venous ulcers with a culture examination positive for pathogenic microbial flora. All patients received a gauze dressing impregnated with oxum followed by compression bandage for 28 days. The primary endpoint was the calculation of ulcer size using ulcer tracing. Assessment of periwound oedema, periwound erythema, wound fibrin and wound granulations were considered as secondary endpoints. There was a singificant reduction in ulcer size starting from day 7 of the treatment. Significant improvements in secondary endpoints were observed. This study has demonstrated that oxum improved the clinical status, reduced the signs of inflammation in venous ulcers in addition to its well confirmed anti-infective properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Lokamanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and Hospital, Mumbai 400022."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dharap", "ForeName": "Satish B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghag", "ForeName": "Geeta S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kulkarni", "ForeName": "K P", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venkatesh", "ForeName": "Veena", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Indian Med Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "7505608", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5847"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bandages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Varicose Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18839643"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
