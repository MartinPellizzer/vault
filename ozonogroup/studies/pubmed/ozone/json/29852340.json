Statistical models were used to produce comprehensive results of COPD deaths, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost, years lived with a disability, and attributable to risk factors in Hubei. The median of the percent change and 95% uncertainty intervals were determined for the period between 1990 and 2015.", "In 2015, there were 37,144 deaths from COPD in Hubei, accounting for 10.05% of the total deaths in Hubei. The age-standardized COPD death rate was reduced by 60.28% from 188.67 per 100,000 (in 1990) to 74.94 per 100,000 (in 2015). The age-standardized prevalence decreased from 4.30% (1990) to 2.85% (2015). By 2015, the leading risk factors for all ages COPD DALYs were smoking and ambient particulate matter pollution, accounting for 44.69% and 32.91%, respectively. The proportion of ambient ozone pollution was increasing steadily each year since 1990.", "Hubei has made substantial progress in reducing the mortality due to COPD since 1990, but the absolute number of COPD cases is increasing steadily, given the population growth and aging.
