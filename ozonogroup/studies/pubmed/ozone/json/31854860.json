Because air pollution levels increase daily, it is important to control NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions from industrial boiler flue gas. A series of different Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts was prepared in this study by different methods. The effects of the preparation methods on selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO-SCR) were investigated. The catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, HR-TEM, and Raman. The results show that the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-S catalyst, prepared by solid grinding with cobalt sulfate as the precursor, had better CO-SCR activity and H<sub>2</sub>O resistance and that Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C, prepared by solid grinding with cobalt acetate as the precursor, showed excellent H<sub>2</sub>O resistance. The NO oxidation results showed that better NO oxidation activity over the catalysts is an important reason for the improved CO-SCR activity. The Raman results indicate that more Co<sup>2+</sup> ions appeared on the surface of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-S, which benefited the formation of oxygen vacancies. The H<sub>2</sub>-TPR results showed better redox property of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-S catalyst. The HR-TEM results shoes that the (111) and (220) crystal planes were exposed mainly on Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-S and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-O and that more (220) crystal planes are conducive to improved reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jia-Yin", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ya-Zhou", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guang-Ming", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment & Natural Resource, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hua-Zhen", "Initials": "HZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854860", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201901100"]}}]}
