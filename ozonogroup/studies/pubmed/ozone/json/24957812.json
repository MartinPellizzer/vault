It is shown that the as-synthesised material consists of large cages connected by very narrow, ca. 7 \u00c5, windows. These windows open up to about 20 \u00c5 following a calcination treatment that suggests that the functionality of SBA-16 could be changed markedly depending upon the post-synthesis treatment. The structure of SBA-16 is compared with surfaces of constant mean curvature. This illustrates that although most of the structure conforms to a surface of constant mean curvature the necks in the structure near the windows deviate strongly. This confirms that attractive forces in this region during synthesis play an important role in shaping the final structure. Following calcination the structure changes as the silica framework relaxes to a constant surface energy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Nanoporous Materials, School of Chemistry, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK. m.anderson@manchester.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24957812", "10.1039/c4cp00343h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
