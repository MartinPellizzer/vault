The ozone dissolved in water generates hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u00b7</sup> OH), which are highly effective in decomposing organic substances, such as malathion and carbosulfan.", "We found that washing pak choi with 2.0\u00a0mg\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> ozone water for 30\u2009min resulted in 58.3% and 38.2% degradation of the malathion and carbosulfan contents respectively, and the degradation rates of these pure pesticides were 83.0% and 66.3% respectively. In addition, the 'first + first'-order reaction kinetic model was found to predict the trend in the pesticide content during ozone water treatment. Based on investigations by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with the structures of the pesticides, the by-products generated were identified. More specifically, the ozonation-based degradation of carbosulfan generated carbofuran and benzofuranol, whereas malathion produced succinic acid and phosphoric acid. Although some new harmful compounds were formed during degradation of the parent pesticides, these were only present in trace quantities and were transient intermediates that eventually disappeared during the reaction.", "Our results, therefore, indicate that ozone water treatment technology for pesticide residue degradation is worthy of popularization and application. \u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food and Chemical Engineering, Shaoyang University, Shaoyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiayi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "lnstitute of Food Processing, Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhaohui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jinlong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6230-7452"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhaoxia", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U5N7SU872W", "NameOfSubstance": "Malathion"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V1DGN4AK6G", "NameOfSubstance": "carbosulfan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Malathion"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Galani YJH, Houbraken M, Wumbei A, Djeugap JF, Fotio D, Gong YY et al., Monitoring and dietary risk assessment of 81 pesticide residues in 11 local agricultural products from the 3 largest cities of Cameroon.
