The necessary catalytic sites in the structure of biochar were originated from the inorganic metals and organic matters in the sludge, which included a large number of functional groups (e.g., C-C, CO, etc.), adsorbed oxygen (O<sub>ads</sub> accounted for 44.82%) and electron defects (I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>=1.01). These active sites could promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g., \u00b7OH,\u00b7O<sup>2-</sup>, etc.). The synergistic interaction between the microorganisms in the activated sludge also facilitated the removal rates of pollutants. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Deinococcu-Thermus were crucial in the bioreactor. In 16 days of reaction, the removal ratios of NH<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub>-N and COD were 98.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11% and 90.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47%, respectively. This study not only explains the mechanism of catalytic ozonation of biochar, but also provides a new way of the practical treatment of landfill leachate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
