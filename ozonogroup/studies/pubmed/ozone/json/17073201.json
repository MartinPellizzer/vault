Further, the influence of ozone on laser fluorescence was investigated.", "82 lesions in 28 children with at least two open single-surface lesions were assessed. The children were anxious and were judged by the referring dentist as non-treatable. For each test lesion, which was treated with ozone, a control lesion was left without ozone treatment. Hardness and laser fluorescence values were assessed and the changes for hardness and laser fluorescence values in the test lesion were compared with the values in the control lesion after 2, 4, 6, and 8 months.", "94 percent of the children were treatable and 93% lost their dental anxiety. The hardness values improved significantly in the ozone-treated test lesions after 4, 6, and 8 months (P< 0.05) compared with baseline while the control lesions had no significant change in hardness at any recall interval. Comparing the differences between test and control teeth over time, the laser fluorescence values improved, however the improvement was not statistically significant (P> 0.05). The use of ozone resulted in an average reduction of 13% of the laser fluorescence values immediately after the ozone treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative, Preventive and Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland. daehnhardt@zmk.unibe.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00e4hnhardt", "ForeName": "Jan Eric", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaeggi", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lussi", "ForeName": "Adrian", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8806701", "ISSNLinking": "0894-8275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries Activity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hardness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17073201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
