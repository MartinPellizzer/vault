Increasing temperature generally exerts a positive effect on soil N<sub>2</sub>O production. However, not much is known on the temperature influence on individual N<sub>2</sub>O production pathways. In this study, both laboratory <sup>15</sup>N labelling experiments with an incubation temperature gradient (35\u202f\u00b0C, 25\u202f\u00b0C, 15\u202f\u00b0C, 5\u202f\u00b0C) and field <sup>15</sup>N labelling experiments carried out in different seasons were conducted in Korean pine forest (KF) and Redwood coniferous forest (RF) soils. The results showed that the contribution of denitrification was positively correlated with temperature in KF and negatively correlated with temperature in RF, while their N<sub>2</sub>O production rates via denitrification (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>d</sub>) all declined with decreasing temperature. The contribution of autotrophic nitrification in KF ranged from 11% to 21%, while the contribution in RF significantly increased with decreasing temperature (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). However, the N<sub>2</sub>O production rates via autotrophic nitrification process (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>a</sub>) were significantly and positively correlated with incubation temperature (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). In addition, the contribution of heterotrophic nitrification to N<sub>2</sub>O production showed a negative and positive relation with increasing temperature in KF and RF, respectively. Whereas, the N<sub>2</sub>O production rates via heterotrophic nitrification (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>h</sub>) showed a significantly positive correlation with temperature (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), but a negative relation with gross heterotrophic nitrification rates. The results in the field experiments corresponded to the laboratory results, indicating that the methods applied in field experiments were suitable for the estimation and prediction of in situ N<sub>2</sub>O production. The response of calculated N<sub>2</sub>O production rates to seasonal temperature in KF during the year of 2015-2017 also confirmed the suitability of the field research methods. This novel in situ technique to determine N<sub>2</sub>O production in temperate forest soils should be validated for other ecosystems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
