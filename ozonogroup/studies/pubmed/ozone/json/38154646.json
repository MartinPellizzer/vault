Under the context of circular economy, metals should be recycled, yet they are difficult to extract for their complex forms in real situations. Based on the protocols of review methodology and the analysis of VOS viewer, there are few reviews on the properties of metal-organic complexes, decomplexation methods, the effect of coexisting ions, the pH influence, and metal recovery methods for the increasingly complicated metal-organic complexes wastewater. Conventional treatment methods such as flocculation, adsorption, biological degradation, and ion exchange fail to decompose metal-organic complexes completely without causing secondary pollution in wastewater. To enhance comprehension of the behavior and morphology exhibited by metal-organic complexes within aqueous solutions, we presented the molecular structure and properties of metal-organic complexes, the decomplexation mechanisms that encompassed both radical and non-radical oxidizing species, including hydroxyl radical (OH), sulfate radical (SO\u02d9<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), superoxide radical (O\u02d9<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). More importantly, we reviewed novel aspects that have not been covered by previous reviews considering the impact of operational parameters and coexisting ions. Finally, the potential avenues and challenges were proposed for future research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
