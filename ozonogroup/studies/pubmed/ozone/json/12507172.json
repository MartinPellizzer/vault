A total of 12,926 subjects were selected from 8 junior high schools. Data about monthly hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses were collected over a period of 1 yr from the National Insurance Bureau. Data included how frequently subjects purchased medication and the respiratory symptoms recorded by clinic and hospital personnel. Pulmonary function tests were administered to 20% of the total study population, which was selected randomly. Data about monthly levels of air pollutants (i.e., particulate matter 10 pm and less [PM10], ozone [O3], sulfur dioxide [SO2], and nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) were provided by Taiwan's Environmental Protection Agency. The prevalence rates of asthma were correlated significantly with NO2 (r = .63) and 03 (r = .51) concentrations. Levels of NO2 and PM10 were correlated significantly with monthly hospital admissions. Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, and peak expiratory flow for asthmatics in central Taiwan were 6-11% lower than normal predicted values for the general Taiwanese student population, adjusted for age, height, and weight. In conclusion, the increased risk of asthma and the frequency of monthly hospital admissions among asthmatics may be correlated positively with pollution levels-especially NO2 and PM10. air pollutants, asthma, mon"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Health, School of Occupational Safety and Health, China Medical College, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Hsien W", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Jim S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Mon C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tai", "ForeName": "Ru C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ming C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Admission"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12507172", "10.1080/00039890209602936"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
