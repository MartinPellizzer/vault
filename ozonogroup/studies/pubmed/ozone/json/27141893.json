In 2013, 67 485 COPD deaths in China were due to ambient ozone pollution, with the highest number in Sichuan province (11 929) and in China lowest in Macao (11). A total of 1.168 million DALYs caused by COPD were due to ambient ozone pollution, with the highest in Sichuan province (0.189 million) and lowest in Macao (257.4). In 2013, the DALY per 100 000 population caused by COPD due to ambient ozone pollution after age standardization was lowest in Heilongjiang province (21.9), Shanghai (26.7), Beijing (38.4), Tianjin (39.3), and Jilin province (39.7) and highest in Sichuan province (206.4), Qinghai province (202.5), Guizhou province (175.3), and Gansu province (171.4). DALYs caused by COPD attributable to ambient ozone pollution increased with age (0.144 million person years for ages 15-49 years, 0.43 million person years for age 50-69 years and 0.594 million person years for age 70 years and above), which were higher in men than in women (0.708 million person years for men and 0.459 million person years for women in 2013). Deaths of COPD attributable to ambient ozone pollution were 49 514 and 67 485 in 1990 and 2013, respectively. DALYs caused by COPD attributable to ozone pollution totaled 0.894 million and 1.168 million person years in 1990 and 2013, respectively. Ambient ozone pollution-related deaths and DALYs increased 36.3% and 30.6%, respectively.", "Compared with 1990, the disease burden of COPD in 2013 attributed to ambient ozone pollution in China increased substantially. Ambient ozone pollution caused great losses among Chinese residents. More attention should be directed toward western provinces with a particularly high disease burden due to ambient ozone pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Y N", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7904962", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disabled Persons"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality-Adjusted Life Years"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27141893", "10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2016.05.002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
