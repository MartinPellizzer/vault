The results show that UV/micro-aeration process is also an advanced oxidation and BP can be effectively degraded by UV/micro-aeration process; the degradation of BP by UV/micro-aeration process is greatly influenced by TOC value, BP initial concentrations, intensity of UV radiation, and initial pH of solution. The k1 value of BP degradation increases with TOC values decreasing,or with intensity of UV radiation increasing. The effect of different BP initial concentrations on removal of BP has also been investigated. The k1 value of BP degradation increases with increasing BP initial concentrations in the range of 189 - 410 microg/L, while decreases with increasing initial BP concentrations in the range of 410 - 971 microg/L. The degradation of BP has been investigated under UV/micro-aeration over a wide pH range (2.77 - 8.16), and BP degradation rate in UV/micro-aeration process was significantly enhanced by the initial pH in the range of 2.77 - 4.01, while decreases in the pH range of 4.70 - 8.16."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China. lry1982_50@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ruo-yu", "Initials": "RY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Nai-yun", "Initials": "NY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jian-fu", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le", "ForeName": "Lin-sheng", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O81VMW36CV", "NameOfSubstance": "butylphen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17891955"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
