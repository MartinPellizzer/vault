It was found that OVOCs, especially ethyl acetate and isopropanol, were the most important species originating from printing factories, which accounted for more than 93.1% of total VOCs. The major components related to manufacturing industries, including automobile, furniture, and coating, were aromatics, mainly <i>m/p</i>-xylene, <i>o</i>-xylene, and ethylbenzene, which contributed 33.5%-90.0% to VOCs. Halogenated hydrocarbons made the largest contribution (52.3%) to VOCs in the food processing industry. The main components of VOCs were halogenoalkanes (25.5%) and alkanes (28.8%) in rubber factories. As for graphite carbon factories, the main components of VOCs were aromatics (28.5%) and alkanes (24.1%). Compared with previous studies, the VOC emission characteristics of factories involving solvent usage in Zhengzhou are consistent with those in other cities, but the compositional information of VOCs varies across different factories, even within the same industry, due to the different production processes and raw materials used. Risk assessment showed that the concentration of VOCs emitted from solvent factories are positively correlated with ozone formation potential (OFP) and the hazard index (HI). Specifically, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and other C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>8</sub> aromatic hydrocarbons contributed significantly to OFP and HI. The HI values were 1.18 and 2.74 in automobile manufacturing factory NO.3 and wooden furniture factory NO.5, respectively, which were higher than the limits stated by EPA regulations because of the different production processes and raw materials, and the VOCs of the factories were mainly composed of aromatics; in particular, C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>9</sub> benzene series contributed significantly to HI and OFP. Therefore, it is necessary to control VOCs originating from industries involving solvent usage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Haihong Ecological Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yi-Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Haihong Ecological Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Jing-Wei", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Haihong Ecological Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dong-Xu", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Haihong Ecological Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Haihong Ecological Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Li-Yan", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bo-Wei", "Initials": "BW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608877", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201911106"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
