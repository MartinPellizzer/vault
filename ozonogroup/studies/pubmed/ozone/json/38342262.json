In this paper, we successfully prepared cellulose-based biomass films with high UV shielding effect, high transparency and high tensile strength by graft-modifying oxidized cellulose nanocellulose (TOCN) with folic acid (FA) and borrowing vacuum-assisted filtration. The films had tunable UV shielding properties depending on the amount of FA added. When the FA addition was 20\u00a0% (V/V), the film showed 0\u00a0% transmittance in the UV region (200-400\u00a0nm) and 90.61\u00a0% transmittance in the visible region (600\u00a0nm), while the tensile strength was up to 150.04\u00a0MPa. This study provides a new integrated process for the value-added utilization of nanocellulose and a new route for the production of functional biomass packaging materials. The film is expected to be applied in the field of food packaging with UV shielding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
