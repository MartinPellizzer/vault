Commercially available NO delivery systems use pressurized cylinders as the source of NO and a sensor to control the concentrations of NO and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) delivered. Cylinder-based delivery systems are safe and widely used around the world, but they are bulky, expensive, and reliant on a robust supply chain. In the past few years, novel NO generators and delivery systems have been developed to overcome these limitations. Electric NO generators produce NO from ambient air using high-voltage electrical discharge to ionize air, which leads to the formation of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). A scavenging system is incorporated to reduce the concentration of the toxic byproducts generated in this type of system. NO can also be generated by the reduction of NO<sub>2</sub> by ascorbic acid or released from liquid solutions or solid nanoparticles. The development of easy-to-use, safe, and portable NO delivery systems may enable the delivery of NO in the out-patient setting or at home. Furthermore, non-cylinder-based NO generators reduce the cost of NO production and storage and may therefore make NO delivery feasible in low-resource settings. Here we review commercially available systems that can generate and administer inhalable NO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 by Daedalus Enterprises."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}], "LastName": "Gianni", "ForeName": "Stefano", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}], "LastName": "Carroll", "ForeName": "Ryan W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Respiratory Care Department, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}], "LastName": "Kacmarek", "ForeName": "Robert M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. lberra@mgh.harvard.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}], "LastName": "Berra", "ForeName": "Lorenzo", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K23 HL128882", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Respir Care", "NlmUniqueID": "7510357", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1324"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension, Pulmonary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration, Artificial"}], "CoiStatement": "Dr Gianni has disclosed no conflicts of interest.
