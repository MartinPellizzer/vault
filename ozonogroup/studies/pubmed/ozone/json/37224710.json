However, the catalytic mechanism of CoO<sub>x</sub> under radiation of plasma is still unclear, such as how the relative importance of the intrinsic structure of the catalyst (e.g., Co<sup>3+</sup> and oxygen vacancy) and the specific energy input (SEI) of the plasma for toluene decomposition performance. CoO<sub>x</sub> -\u00a0\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts were prepared and evaluated by toluene decomposition performance. Changing the calcination temperature of the catalyst altered the content of Co<sup>3+</sup> and oxygen vacancies in CoO<sub>x</sub>, resulting in different catalytic performance. The results of the artificial neural network (ANN) models presented that the relative importance of three reaction parameters (SEI, Co<sup>3+</sup>, and oxygen vacancy) on the mineralization rate and CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity were as follows: SEI >\u00a0oxygen vacancy >\u00a0Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> , and SEI >\u00a0Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> > oxygen vacancy, respectively. Oxygen vacancy is essential for mineralization rate, and CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity is more dependent on Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> content. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism of toluene decomposition was proposed according to the analysis results of in-situ DRIFTS and PTR-TOF-MS. This work provides new ideas for the rational design of CoO<sub>x</sub> catalysts in plasma catalytic systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
