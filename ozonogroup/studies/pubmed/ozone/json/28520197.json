EPA's standard approach is to make epidemiologically-based risk estimates based on a single statistical model selected from the scientific literature, called the \"core\" model. The uncertainty presented for \"core\" risk estimates reflects only the statistical uncertainty associated with that one model's concentration-response function parameter estimate(s). However, epidemiologically-based risk estimates are also subject to \"model uncertainty,\" which is a lack of knowledge about which of many plausible model specifications and data sets best reflects the true relationship between health and ambient pollutant concentrations. In 2002, a National Academies of Sciences (NAS) committee recommended that model uncertainty be integrated into EPA's standard risk analysis approach. This article discusses how model uncertainty can be taken into account with an integrated uncertainty analysis (IUA) of health risk estimates. It provides an illustrative numerical example based on risk of premature death from respiratory mortality due to long-term exposures to ambient ozone, which is a health risk considered in the 2015 ozone NAAQS decision. This example demonstrates that use of IUA to quantitatively incorporate key model uncertainties into risk estimates produces a substantially altered understanding of the potential public health gain of a NAAQS policy decision, and that IUA can also produce more helpful insights to guide that decision, such as evidence of decreasing incremental health gains from progressive tightening of a NAAQS."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Society for Risk Analysis."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NERA Economic Consulting, Washington, DC, USA."}], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Anne E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NERA Economic Consulting, San Francisco, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Glasgow", "ForeName": "Garrett", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Risk Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8109978", "ISSNLinking": "0272-4332"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28520197", "10.1111/risa.12828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
