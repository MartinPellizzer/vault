Meanwhile, identified inflammation pathways in animal have not been applied in epidemiological studies, and beneficial effect of residential greenness remained unclear. Therefore, we used data from typically air-polluted Chinese cities to answer these questions. Particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of \u2264\u00a01\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>1</sub>), PM with a diameter of \u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), PM with a diameter of \u2264\u00a010\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were predicted by space-time extremely randomized trees model. Residential greenness was reflected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured, and atherogenic coefficient (AC) and TG/HDL-C (TGH) ratio were calculated to indicate lipid metabolism. Generalized additive mixed model and quantile g-computation were respectively conducted to investigate individual and joint lipidemic effect of air pollutants. Covariates including demographical characteristics, living habits, meteorological factors, time trends, and disease information were considered to avoid confounding our results. Complement C3 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were analyzed as potential mediators. Finally, association between NDVI and lipid markers were explored. We found that long-term air pollutants exposure were positively associated with lipid markers. Complement C3 mediated 54.72% (95% CI: 0.30, 63.10) and 72.53% (95% CI: 0.65, 77.61) of the association between PM<sub>1</sub> and TC and LDL-C, respectively. We found some significant associations of lipid markers with NDVI<sub>1000\u00a0m</sub> rather than NDVI<sub>500\u00a0m</sub>. BMI, disease status, smoke/drink habits are important effect modifiers. Results are robust in sensitive analysis. Our study indicated that air pollutants exposure may detriment lipid metabolism and inflammation may be the potential triggering pathways, while greenness may exert beneficial effects. This study provided insights for the lipidemic effects of air pollution and greenness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
