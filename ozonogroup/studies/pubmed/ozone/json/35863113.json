Timescales for multiphase reactions of ozone in atmospheric aqueous phases are governed by coupled kinetic processes between the gas phase, the particle interface, and its bulk, which respond dynamically to reactive consumption of O<sub>3</sub>. However, models of atmospheric aerosol reactivity often do not account for the coupled nature of multiphase processes. To examine these dynamics, we use new and prior experimental observations of aqueous droplet reaction kinetics, including three systems with a range of surface affinities and ozonolysis rate coefficients (<i>trans</i>-aconitic acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), maleic acid (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), and sodium nitrite (NaNO<sub>2</sub>)). Using literature rate coefficients and thermodynamic properties, we constrain a simple two-compartment stochastic kinetic model which resolves the interface from the particle bulk and represents O<sub>3</sub> partitioning, diffusion, and reaction as a coupled kinetic system. Our kinetic model accurately predicts decay kinetics across all three systems, demonstrating that both the thermodynamic properties of O<sub>3</sub> and the coupled kinetic and diffusion processes are key to making accurate predictions. An enhanced concentration of adsorbed O<sub>3</sub>, compared to gas and bulk phases is rapidly maintained and remains constant even as O<sub>3</sub> is consumed by reaction. Multiphase systems dynamically seek to achieve equilibrium in response to reactive O<sub>3</sub> loss, but this is hampered at solute concentrations relevant to aqueous aerosol by the rate of O<sub>3</sub> arrival in the bulk by diffusion. As a result, bulk-phase O<sub>3</sub> becomes depleted from its Henry's law solubility. This bulk-phase O<sub>3</sub> depletion limits reaction timescales for relatively slow-reacting organic solutes with low interfacial affinity (i.e., <i>trans</i>-aconitic and maleic acids, with <i>k</i><sub>rxn</sub> \u2248 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), which is in contrast to fast-reacting solutes with higher surface affinity (i.e., nitrite, with <i>k</i><sub>rxn</sub> \u2248 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) where surface reactions strongly impact the observed decay kinetics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0386-0156"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Willis", "ForeName": "Megan D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0264-0872"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "Kevin R", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35863113", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c03059"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
