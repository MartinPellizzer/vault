We divided all patients on the two groups. Our study groups were 50 patients who had therapy by ozone together with other general treatment and surgery treatment (daily dressings, ointments and solutions). Our control groups were 72 patients, who had treated only by general methods and surgery treatment (daily dressings, ointments and solutions).The patients of our explore group had received intravenous injection of saline ozone solution together with other general treatment and surgery treatment (daily dressings, ointments and solutions).", "Results: it had studied of indicators of oxidative modification of proteins, lipid peroxidation in blood plasma, antioxidant protection during this period, there were no significant changes in these parameters between the control and experimental groups. As the result of the study was found that the leukocyte index of intoxication in patients in the main and control groups was almost indistinguishable. Regarding the indexes of hematological index of intoxication, which decreased during the treatment of patients of the main group, and different from the patients of the control group, in which this indicator increased sharply. The result of the study of changes in the indicators of sorption capacity of erythrocytes showed that the level of sorption capacity of erythrocytes in patients in the main group during treatment, also decreased, compared with patients in the control group.", "Conclusions: Therefore, the use of ozone in the treatment of patients with complicated forms of diabetes does not cause a negative impact on the dynamics of homeostasis and indicators of the level of intoxication of the body. Ozone therapy has a beneficial effect on the course and wound process in patients with diabetes with purulent processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BUKOVINIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHERNIVTSI, UKRAINE."}], "LastName": "Karatieieva", "ForeName": "Svitlana Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BUKOVINIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHERNIVTSI, UKRAINE."}], "LastName": "Muzyka", "ForeName": "Nataliia Y", "Initials": "NY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BUKOVINIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHERNIVTSI, UKRAINE."}], "LastName": "Yakovets", "ForeName": "Karolina I", "Initials": "KI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BUKOVINIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHERNIVTSI, UKRAINE."}], "LastName": "Bakun", "ForeName": "Oksana V", "Initials": "OV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BUKOVINIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHERNIVTSI, UKRAINE."}], "LastName": "Slobodian", "ForeName": "Ksenia V", "Initials": "KV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Wiad Lek", "NlmUniqueID": "9705467", "ISSNLinking": "0043-5147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Foot"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "57"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34155997"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
