During normal operations, one of six neutral-density filters is selected automatically to maintain the detector in its linear response range. On the basis of these standard direct-sun observations, estimates of aerosol optical depth can be derived, provided that a calibration of the relative measurements is available for each neutral-density filter. To obtain the calibration, we implemented a routine to measure direct-sun signals with a fixed neutral-density filter and applied the Langley method to the measured photon counts. Results show that if a sufficiently large number of cloud-free mornings or afternoons is available, a reliable calibration can be achieved even at sea-level sites that are characterized by large aerosol variability. The derived aerosol optical depths appear consistent with those measured independently by a multifilter rotating shadow-band radiometer. Existing relatively long-term series of direct-sun ozone measurements by Brewer instruments may be used for retrieval of aerosol optical depth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Boulder, Colorado 80303, USA. franco.marenco@casaccia.enea.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marenco", "ForeName": "Franco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "di Sarra", "ForeName": "Alcide", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Luisi", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11921812", "10.1364/ao.41.001805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
