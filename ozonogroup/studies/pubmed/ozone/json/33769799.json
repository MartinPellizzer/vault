However, the designed synthesis of high-performance O<sub>3</sub> elimination catalysts suitable for broadly variable air compositions, especially a variable water vapor content, remains daunting. Herein, we report a new manganese-based metal organic framework, [Mn<sub>3</sub>(\u03bc<sub>3</sub>-OH)<sub>2</sub>(TTPE)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O (H<sub>4</sub>TTPE = 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(2<i>H</i>-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl) ethane), denoted as ZZU-281. ZZU-281 catalyzes O<sub>3</sub> decomposition with a nearly constant 100% working efficiency over the entire humidity range from dry (\u22645% relative humidity (RH)) to high humidity (90% RH). We found that the maintainable coordinated water molecules and OH groups are activated by Mn<sup>2+</sup>, becoming active sites for O<sub>3</sub> transfer to O<sub>2</sub> with a low activation energy. The unique open channels, water retainability, and water stability of ZZU-281 further support the high catalytic performance. This work opens a new avenue for designing efficient catalysts for O<sub>3</sub> elimination in practice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Catalysis Center, Henan Key Laboratory of Crystalline Molecular Functional Materials, Henan International Joint Laboratory of Tumor Theranostical Cluster Materials, and College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-Bing", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Catalysis Center, Henan Key Laboratory of Crystalline Molecular Functional Materials, Henan International Joint Laboratory of Tumor Theranostical Cluster Materials, and College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Ya-Nan", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Catalysis Center, Henan Key Laboratory of Crystalline Molecular Functional Materials, Henan International Joint Laboratory of Tumor Theranostical Cluster Materials, and College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Shu-Na", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8892-7825"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Catalysis Center, Henan Key Laboratory of Crystalline Molecular Functional Materials, Henan International Joint Laboratory of Tumor Theranostical Cluster Materials, and College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian-You", "Initials": "QY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6728-0559"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Catalysis Center, Henan Key Laboratory of Crystalline Molecular Functional Materials, Henan International Joint Laboratory of Tumor Theranostical Cluster Materials, and College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zang", "ForeName": "Shuang-Quan", "Initials": "SQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33769799", "10.1021/jacs.1c01027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
