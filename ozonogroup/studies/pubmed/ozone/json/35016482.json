Air temperature is a main factor affecting the concentration of air pollutants. This study sought to examine the relationship between air temperature, air pollutants, and their interactions in elderly patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in Liaoning Province, China.", "The population data primarily comprised data on daily hospitalizations due to CHD between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 at the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. A total of 25,461 patients, who were permanent residents of Liaoning Province, were included in the study. The meteorological data included data on the average daily temperature and air pollutant data of the average daily concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) over the hospitalization period. A multiple linear regression model was constructed to analyze the relationship between meteorological factors and CHD.", "The interaction between air temperature and SO2, NO2, and O3 concentrations was related to the number of daily CHD-related hospitalizations in elderly patients aged \u226565 years (P=0.0023); however, this correlation was lower than that of the interaction between SO2 and NO2 concentrations (P=0.0026). Additionally, age exerted a greater effect than air temperature and air pollutants.", "The incidence of CHD in elderly patients aged \u226565 years was found to be related to the interaction of SO2 and NO2 concentrations, and the interaction of air temperature and the concentrations of SO2, NO2, and O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hospital Management Office, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jinling", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhiyong", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ann Palliat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101585484", "ISSNLinking": "2224-5820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35016482", "10.21037/apm-21-3212"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
