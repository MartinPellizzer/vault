The potential threat of ozone to vegetation urges for studying plant protection methods. The chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) is the most extensively utilized substance for protecting plants against ozone damage in research projects. This commentary provides collective evidence showing hormetic responses of plants to EDU and suggests that EDU may act as a conditioning agent against elevated ozone exposures. This article also suggests testing different substances in a hormetic framework for protecting plants against ozone damage. The concept of hormesis provides a significant perspective for reducing the economic cost for plant protection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hokkaido Research Center, Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute (FFPRI), Forest Research and Management Organization, Hitsujigaoka, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Faculty of Agriculture, School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0058-4857"], "LastName": "Agathokleous", "ForeName": "Evgenios", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hokkaido Research Center, Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute (FFPRI), Forest Research and Management Organization, Hitsujigaoka, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitao", "ForeName": "Mitsutoshi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dose Response", "NlmUniqueID": "101308899", "ISSNLinking": "1559-3258"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Evgenios Agathokleous is an International Research Fellow (ID No: P17102) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Agathokleous E.
