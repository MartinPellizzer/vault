The gas chromatograph and high performance liquid chromatography analyzed 58 VOCs and two aldehydes, respectively. Among the four sampling sites, the order of the five VOC classes based on the reactivity approach was different from the concentration-based method. Alkenes as well as aromatics provided a major contribution for the OFP. The relative ranking of the species at the four sites were quite dissimilar. Toluene was the most in abundance at each site. The most abundant species at the windward and leeward sites was different. The reactivity of the air mass at the leeward sites showed a similar pattern and had higher reactivity than the windward sites. Comparisons of the two ratios, xylene/benzene and toluene/benzene were used to assess the relative age of the air parcels and provide evidence of transport."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Safety Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Touliu, 640 Yunlin, Taiwan hsiehcc@yuntech.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsieh", "ForeName": "Chu-Chin", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Jiun-Horng", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12685754", "10.1016/s0045-6535(02)00275-8", "S0045-6535(02)00275-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
