Studies were conducted in the combined process of DNBF-O<sub>3</sub>-GAC to explore the efficiency of the advanced removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and microbial metabolite by using synthetic effluent made from running water and chemicals. Corresponding comparative studies were conducted by using the secondary effluent from the WWTP. The microbial population structure in the biofilm of the denitrification biofilter was analyzed by adopting MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technologies. The results indicated that the combination process achieved high efficiency removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and microbial metabolite. The average removal rate of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N in the simulated and actual water period reached 88.87% and 79.99%, respectively; the average removal rate of TP reached 87.67% and 65.51%, respectively; and the average removal rate of UV<sub>254</sub> reached 45.51% and 49.23%, respectively. Each processing unit had different functions. The changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, TN, TP, and TFe mainly occurred in the denitrification biofilter, and the removal of UV<sub>254</sub> and the change in the three-dimensional fluorescence intensity mainly occurred in the ozone-activated carbon reactor. The cluster analysis at the genus level indicated that the denitrification system had sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria. Sulfur autotrophic denitrification increased obviously in the actual water period when relatively lack of carbon sources, and the proportion of <i>Thiobacillus</i> increased from 7.44% to 29.62%. The complementary effect of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification had extended the use of the new slow-release carbon source."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Water Quality Science and Water Environment Recovery Engineering, College of Architectural Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huizhou City Huayu Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Survey and Design Co., Ltd., Huizhou 516003, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Li-Yan", "Initials": "LY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Water Quality Science and Water Environment Recovery Engineering, College of Architectural Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Rui-Xia", "Initials": "RX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Water Quality Science and Water Environment Recovery Engineering, College of Architectural Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Water Quality Science and Water Environment Recovery Engineering, College of Architectural Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Water Quality Science and Water Environment Recovery Engineering, College of Architectural Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xia", "Initials": "XX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denitrification"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965689", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201706070"]}}]}
