Although it has been extensively used, its potential toxicity in the absence of ozone is unknown and its mode of action is unclear. The purpose of this research was to toxicologically assess EDU and to further investigate its mode of action using Lemna minor L. as a model organism. Application of EDU concentrations greater than 593\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1) (practically 600\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1)) resulted in adverse inhibition of colony growth. As no-observed-toxic-effects concentration (NOEL) we recommend a concentration of 296\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1) (practically 300\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1)). A hormetic response was detected, i.e. stimulatory effects of low EDU concentrations, which may indicate overcompensation in response to disruption in homeostasis. Growth inhibition and suppressed biomass were associated with impacted chlorophyll a fluorescence (\u03a6PSII, qP and ETR). Furthermore, EDU increased mesophyll thickness, as indicated by frond succulence index. Applications of concentrations \u2265593\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1) to uncontrolled environments should be avoided due to potential toxicity to sensitive organisms and the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
