Three and 7 days after pump implantation the cumulative labeling indices were measured in the alveolar zone and in the airways. Greater alveolar labeling indices were observed 7 days after implantation of the minipumps than after 3 days in all groups, but no ozone-related changes were found in the alveoli of rats in either experimental group at either time. After 3 or 7 days, the labeling index in the large intrapulmonary airways and in the terminal bronchioli of the rats exposed to the higher dose rate (0.8 ppm) was increased. In rats exposed to the lower dose rate (0.4 ppm) the labeling index was significantly elevated in the terminal bronchioli after 3 days and in both the terminal bronchioli and large intrapulmonary airways after 7 days. In the terminal bronchioli the extent of cell proliferation appeared to be defined by dose rate rather than by cumulative exposure. It is concluded that measurement of the airway labeling index is a sensitive indicator of the response of the rat lung to acute exposure to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Toxicology and Environmental Health, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajini", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gelzleichter", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Last", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Witschi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-05707", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RR-00169", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8248943", "10.1016/0300-483x(93)90099-e", "0300-483X(93)90099-E"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
