In an effort to reduce the negative environmental and economic impacts of road salts, many municipalities have turned to agro-based anti-icing materials that are rich in organic material. To date, the reactivity of both anti-icer and saline road dust with pollutant gases remain unexplored, which limits our ability to assess the potential impacts of these materials on air quality in high-latitude regions. Here, we used a coated-wall flow tube to investigate the uptake of ozone, an important air pollutant, by road dust collected in Edmonton, Canada. At 25% relative humidity (RH) and 50 ppb ozone, <i>\u03b3</i><sub>BET</sub> for ozone uptake by this sample is (8.0 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup> under dark conditions and (2.1 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10<sup>-7</sup> under illuminated conditions. These values are 2-4\u00d7 higher than those previously obtained by our group for natural mineral dusts, but are not large enough for suspended road dust to influence local ozone mixing ratios. In a separate set of experiments, we also investigated the uptake of ozone by calcium chloride (<i>i.e.,</i> road salt) and commercial anti-icer solution. Although ozone uptake by pure calcium chloride was negligible, ozone uptake by anti-icer was significant, which implies that the reactivity of anti-icer is conferred by its organic content. Importantly, ozone uptake by anti-icer-and, to a lesser extent, road dust doped with anti-icer-leads to the release of inorganic chlorine gas, which we collected using inline reductive trapping and quantified using ion chromatography. To explain these results, we propose a novel pathway for chlorine activation: here, ozone oxidation of the anti-icer organic fraction (in this case, molasses) yields reactive OH radicals that can oxidize chloride. In summary, this study demonstrates the ability of road dust and anti-icer to influence atmospheric oxidant mixing ratios in cold-climate urban areas, and highlights previously unidentified air quality impacts of winter road maintenance decisions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1417-8937"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abou-Ghanem", "ForeName": "Maya", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4430-6848"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Nodeh-Farahani", "ForeName": "Danial", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1570-488X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada."}], "LastName": "McGrath", "ForeName": "Devon T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8926-4237"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "VandenBoer", "ForeName": "Trevor C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6078-9387"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Styler", "ForeName": "Sarah A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M4I0D6VV5M", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36044235", "10.1039/d1em00393c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
