However, insufficient colour removal was achieved for possible reuse. The aim of the work presented in this paper was to test the performance of chemical advanced oxidation on the elimination of the colour downstream of an MBR. To improve the quality of the membrane bioreactor effluent three different oxidation treatments were tested at lab-scale: ozonation, chlorination and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Colour, COD and BOD5 were controlled in order to assess the effectiveness of each process. For chlorination, even with 250 mg/L (active chlorine) only 80% colour removal (SACin = 14; SACout = 2.8) was achieved which is considered unsatisfactory. For hydrogen peroxide, the colour removal was even poorer; it was just 10% at a concentration of 250 mg/L. In contrast, good results were obtained by ozonation. By using only 38 mg/L within 20 minutes, it was possible to achieve the reuse recommendation with a satisfactory colour removal of 93% (SACin = 14; SACout = 0.98). The results showed that ozonation was the most promising method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biotechnology, IFA-Tulln, Konrad Lorenzstrasse 20, 3430 Tulln, Austria. brik@ifa-tulln.ac.at"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brik", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chamam", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00f6berl", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braun", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuchs", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15077987"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
