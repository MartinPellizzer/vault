Accurate, robust analytical techniques for measuring its atmospheric abundance are of critical importance. Cavity ring-down spectroscopy has been successfully used for sensitive and accurate measurements of many atmospheric species. However, this technique has not been used for atmospheric measurements of ozone, because the strongest ozone absorption bands occur in the ultraviolet spectral region, where Rayleigh and Mie scattering cause significant cavity losses and dielectric mirror reflectivities are limited. Here, we describe a compact instrument that measures O3 by chemical conversion to NO2 in excess NO, with subsequent detection by cavity ring-down spectroscopy. This method provides a simple, accurate, and high-precision measurement of atmospheric ozone. The instrument consists of two channels. The sum of NO2 and converted O3 (defined as Ox) is measured in the first channel, while NO2 alone is measured in the second channel. NO2 is directly detected in each channel by cavity ring-down spectroscopy with a laser diode light source at 404 nm. The limit of detection for O3 is 26 pptv (2 sigma precision) at 1 s time resolution. The accuracy of the measurement is \u00b12.2%, with the largest uncertainty being the effective NO2 absorption cross-section. The linear dynamic range of the instrument has been verified from the detection limit to above 200 ppbv (r2>99.99%). The observed precision on signal (2 sigma) with 41 ppbv O3 is 130 pptv in 1 s. Comparison of this instrument to UV absorbance instruments for ambient O3 concentrations shows linear agreement (r2=99.1%) with slope of 1.012\u00b10.002."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, 216 UCB, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States. rebecca.washenfelder@noaa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Washenfelder", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "N L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dube", "ForeName": "W P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21366216", "10.1021/es103340u"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
