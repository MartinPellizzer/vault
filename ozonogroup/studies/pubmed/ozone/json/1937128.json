Most discussions have implicated the UFA in cell membranes, but lung lining fluids also contain fatty acids that are from 20 to 40% unsaturated. Since UFA in lung lining fluids exist in a highly aquated environment, ozonation would be expected to produce aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide, rather than the Criegee ozonide. In agreement with this expectation, we find that ozonations of emulsions of fatty acids containing from one to four double bonds give one mole of H2O2 for each mole of ozone reacted. Ozonation of oleic acid emulsions and dioleoyl phosphatidyl choline gives similar results. with two moles of aldehydes and one mole of H2O2 formed per mole of ozone reacted. The net reaction that occurs when ozone reacts with pulmonary lipids is suggested to be given by equation 1. [formula: see text]. From 5 to 10% yields of Criegee ozonides also appear to be formed. In addition, a direct reaction of unknown mechanism occurs between ozone and UFA in homogeneous organic solution, in homogeneous solutions in water, in aqueous emulsions, and in lipid bilayers to give organic radicals that can be spin trapped. These radicals are suggested to be responsible for initiating lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide, and directly produced organic radicals are suggested to be mediators of ozone-induced pathology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodynamics Institute, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge 70803-1800."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pryor", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Church", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8709159", "ISSNLinking": "0891-5849"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Free Radic Biol Med 1992;12(5):451"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "NumberOfReferences": "39"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1937128", "10.1016/0891-5849(91)90186-7", "0891-5849(91)90186-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
