The presented dataset represents monthly data on climate change impact indicators such as Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Human Health Particulate, Eutrophication Potential, Ozone Depletion Potential and Smog Potential. It also covers the history of monthly gas consumption and energy cost data for each school in each period read by the gas agent; In addition to the history of monthly weather information for each city/province. Information provided in this data article can be useful for research on energy prediction studies and also energy management strategies, as well as policymakers to achieve sustainability factors, and to choose the most suitable measures for educational buildings. Considering that few data sets have been published on this topic and in this type of climate, this dataset can be useful for researchers in sustainability and resiliency."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Management and Economics, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Norouzi", "ForeName": "Mohammadsaleh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Architecture, Pars University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Labbafan", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Architecture, Pars University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farajnia", "ForeName": "Bahareh", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Architecture, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Torabi", "ForeName": "Mahsa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Management, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Norouzi", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "ASMI.
