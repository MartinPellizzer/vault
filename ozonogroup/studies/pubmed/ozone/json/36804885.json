Projection of future fire activities is challenging due to the joint impacts of climate, vegetation, and human activities. Here, we project global changes of fire-induced particulate matter smaller than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) under 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C/2\u00a0\u00b0C warming using a climate-chemistry-vegetation coupled model in combination with site-level and satellite-based observations. Compared to the present day, fire emissions of varied air pollutants increase by 10.0%-15.4% at the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C warming period and 15.1%-22.5% at the 2\u00a0\u00b0C warming period, with the most significant enhancements in Amazon, southern Africa, and boreal Eurasia. The warmer climate promotes fuel dryness and the higher leaf area index increases fuel availability, leading to escalated fire flammability globally. However, moderate declines in fire emissions are predicted over the Sahel region, because the higher population density increases fire suppressions and consequently inhibits fire activities over central Africa. Following the changes in fire emissions, the population-weighted exposure to fire PM<sub>2.5</sub> increases by 5.1% under 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C warming and 13.0% under 2\u00a0\u00b0C warming. Meanwhile, the exposure to fire O<sub>3</sub> enhances by 10.2% and 16.0% in response to global warming of 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 2\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. As a result, limiting global temperature increase to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C can greatly reduce the risks of exposure to fire-induced air pollution compared to 2\u00a0\u00b0C."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
