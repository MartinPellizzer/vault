In 2014 we conducted tests in a heavily trafficked tunnel in south China to characterize emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from on-road vehicle fleet and compared our results with those obtained in the same tunnel in 2004. Alkanes, aromatics, and alkenes had average emission factors (EFs) of 338, 63, and 42\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2014 against that of 194, 129, and 160\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2004, respectively. In 2014, LPG-related propane, n-butane and i-butane were the top three non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) with EFs of 184\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021, 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 and 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>; the gasoline evaporation marker i-pentane had an average EF of 17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>; ethylene and propene were the top two alkenes with average EFs of 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 and 9.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>, respectively; isoprene had no direct emission from vehicles; toluene showed the highest EF of 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> among the aromatics; and acetylene had an average EF of 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>. While EFs of total NMHCs decreased only 9% from 493\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0120\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2004 to 449\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2014, their total ozone formation potential (OFP) decreased by 57% from 2.50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup>\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2004 to 1.10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup>\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2014, and their total secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) decreased by 50% from 50\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2004 to 25\u00a0mg\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> in 2014. The large drop in ozone and SOA formation potentials could be explained by reduced emissions of reactive alkenes and aromatics, due largely to fuel transition from gasoline/diesel to LPG for taxis/buses and upgraded vehicle emission standards."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
