In the last few years, human exposure to BPA has been extensively high due to the continuous increment in the Annual Growth Rate (AGR) of the BPA global market. The presence and transportation of BPA in the environment could cause serious damage to aquatic life and human health. This paper reviewed the literature on the exposure and toxicity mechanisms of BPA and advanced analytical techniques for the detection of BPA in the environment and human beings. The study indicated that BPA can cause damaging effects on numerous tissues and organs, including the reproductive system, metabolic dysfunction, respiratory system, immune system and central nervous system. On the basis of reported studies on animals, it appears that the exposure of BPA can be carcinogenic and responsible for causing a variety of cancers like ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and liver cancer. This review paper focused mainly on the current progress in BPA removal technologies within last ten years (2012-2022). This paper presents a comprehensive overview of individual removal technologies, including adsorption, photocatalysis/photodegradation, ozonation/advance oxidation, photo-fenton, membranes/nanofilters, and biodegradation, along with removal mechanisms. The extensive literature study shows that each technology has its own removal mechanism and their respective limitations in BPA treatment. In adsorption and membrane separation process, most of BPA has been treated by electrostatic interaction, hydrogen boning and \u03c0-\u03c0 interations mechanism. Whereas in the degradation mechanism, O* and OH* species have played a major role in BPA removal. Some factors could alter the removal potential and efficiency of BPA removal. This review paper will provide a useful guide in providing directions for future investigation to address the problem of BPA-containing wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
