Each of 6 workers in an office building complained of respiratory symptoms, and of difficulty with memory and concentration in the workplace, a tightly-sealed structure under negative pressure. No single contaminant was identified to explain the clinical syndromes. No detectable levels of carbon monoxide, methyl ethyl ketone, formaldehyde, ozone, carbon disulfide, nitric oxide, ethylene oxide, ammonia, aldehydes, trichloroethylene or similar chlorinated compounds were found. Carbon dioxide and methane were both present at above ambient outdoor air concentrations. Carbon dioxide was documented to accumulate over a weekend with no occupants in the building, suggesting a geologic source."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuortes", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Surveys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2124746"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
