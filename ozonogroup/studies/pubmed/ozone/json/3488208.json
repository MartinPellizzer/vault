Such reductions might greatly compromise the ability of the immune system to deal with additional oxidant stress, as encountered during exposure to air pollutants such as ozone (O3). To study possible interactions of these oxidative stresses on immune function, male Long-Evans hooded rats were maintained 5 weeks on torula yeast-based diets, with or without the addition of E or Se. Each dietary group was subdivided into O3-exposed and nonexposed groups. Two different regimens of O3 exposure were used: continuous (1.0 ppm, 8 hr/day for 7 days) or intermittent (2.0 ppm, 8 hr/day for 4 days, 2-4 days in ambient air followed by 1 day of exposure prior to sacrifice). Exposure to O3 in either regimen resulted in increased numbers of cells recovered by pulmonary lavage. With continuous exposure this increase was due to macrophage influx and, with intermittent exposure, due to influx of both macrophages and neutrophils. Combined deficiency of E and Se led to an enhanced ability of spleen and lung cells to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCMC). In animals deficient in E, but not Se, O3 exposure depressed spleen cell ADCMC. Deficiencies of either E or Se also depressed lymphocyte response to mitogens. Although intermittent exposure to O3 caused no changes in mitogen response, in animals exposed continuously to O3 there was a significant enhancement of this response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eskew", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scheuchenzuber", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scholz", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zarkower", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3488208", "10.1016/s0013-9351(86)80103-7", "S0013-9351(86)80103-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
