Regardless of O(3) exposure and peak O(3) episode occurrence, a peak O(3) episode in August caused the greatest reduction in carbon (C) gain in yellow poplar, whereas a peak O(3) episode in July caused the greatest reduction in C gain of loblolly pine. In both species, timing of the greatest simulated O(3) effect corresponded with the completion of the annual foliage production phenophase. Simulated C gain of yellow poplar (total tree, coarse root, and total nonstructural carbohydrate) was reduced by O(3) to a greater extent than the corresponding compartments in loblolly pine, but the opposite was true for fine roots. This differential sensitivity to O(3) reflects the fact that both C assimilation and the O(3) response of the species were parameterized according to observed field measurements of each species. The differential sensitivity to O(3) of these species may have long-term implications for species composition in southeastern USA forests."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Resource Science, University of Nevada, Fleischmann Agriculture, Room 128, Reno, NV 89557-0013, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Constable", "ForeName": "J V", "Initials": "JV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Retzlaff", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14759902", "10.1093/treephys/17.10.627"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
