In terms of total columnar ozone (TCO), emphases were made to compare satellite-based retrieval with ground-based observation and existing trend in decadal and seasonal variation was also identified. Both satellite-retrieved (Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument-Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (OMI-DOAS)) and ground-based observations (IMD-O<sub>3</sub>) revealed satisfying agreement with OMI-DOAS observation over predicting TCO with a positive bias of 7.24\u00a0% under all-sky conditions. Minor variation between daily daytime (r\u00a0=\u00a00.54; R <sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a029\u00a0%; n\u00a0=\u00a0275) and satellite overpass time-averaged TCO (r\u00a0=\u00a00.58; R <sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a034\u00a0%; n\u00a0=\u00a0208) was also recognized. A consistent and clear seasonal trend in columnar ozone (2005-2015) was noted with summertime (March-June) maxima (Varanasi, 290.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8; Lucknow, 295.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5\u00a0DU) and wintertime (December-February) minima (Varanasi, 257.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1; Lucknow, 258.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0DU). Seasonal trend decomposition based on locally weighted regression smoothing technique identified marginally decreasing trend (Varanasi, 0.0084; Lucknow, 0.0096\u00a0DU\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup>) especially due to reduction in monsoon time minima and summertime maxima. In continuation to TCO, variation in ground-level ozone in terms of seasonality and precursor gases were also analysed from September 2014 to August 2015. Both stations registered similar pattern of variation with Lucknow representing slightly higher annual mean (44.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030.6; range, 1.5-309.1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) over Varanasi (38.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.7; range, 4.9-104.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). Variation in ground-level ozone was further explained in terms water vapour, atmospheric boundary layer height and solar radiation. Ambient water vapour content was found to associate negatively (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.28, n\u00a0=\u00a0284) with ground-level ozone with considerable seasonal variation in Varanasi. Implication of solar radiation on formation of ground-level ozone was overall positive (Varanasi, 0.60; Lucknow, 0.26), while season-specific association was recorded in case of atmospheric boundary layer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Prashant K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9717-8248"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India. tb.iesd@bhu.ac.in."}], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Aneja", "ForeName": "Viney P", "Initials": "VP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1992 May 22;256(5060):1157-65", "ArticleIdList": ["1317061"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 27;101(17):6346-50", "ArticleIdList": ["15084740"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2016 Dec 1;572:404-411", "ArticleIdList": ["27543944"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Int. 2015 Nov;84:201-2", "ArticleIdList": ["26093957"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2014 Jun;21(12):7329-38", "ArticleIdList": ["24573465"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Nov 18;111(46):16319-24", "ArticleIdList": ["25368149"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 2001 Mar 16;291(5511):2128-32", "ArticleIdList": ["11251113"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2015 Jan;22(2):1329-43", "ArticleIdList": ["25142343"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27704381", "10.1007/s11356-016-7738-2", "10.1007/s11356-016-7738-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
