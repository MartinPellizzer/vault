Most of these compounds have been demonstrated to be resistant to conventional degradation processes. Advanced oxidation processes can be effective to mineralize nitrogen-containing compounds and improve the efficacy of overall treatment schemes. Due to a global concern for the occurrence of toxic and hazardous amino-compounds and their harmful degradation products in water, it is important to develop technologies that focus on all the aspects of their degradation. Our focus is to present a state-of-the-art review on the degradation of several amine- and azo-based compounds using advanced oxidation processes. The categories reviewed are aromatic amines, aliphatic amines, N-containing dyes and N-containing pesticides. Data has been compiled for degradation efficiencies of each process, reaction mechanisms focusing on specific attack of oxidants on N atoms, the effect of process parameters like pH, initial concentration, time of treatment, etc. and identification of intermediates. Several AOPs have been compared to provide a systematic overview of available literature that will drive essential aspects of future research on amine-based compounds. Ozone is observed to be highly reactive to most amines, dyes and pesticides, followed by Fenton processes. Degradation of amines is highly sensitive to pH and mechanisms differ at different pH values. Cavitation is a promising alternative pre-treatment method for cost reduction. Hybrid methods under optimized conditions are demonstrated to give synergistic effects and must be tailored for specific effluents in question. In conclusion, even though nitrogen-containing compounds are recalcitrant in nature, the use of advanced oxidation processes at carefully established optimum conditions can yield highly efficient degradation of the compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
