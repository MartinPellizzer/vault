Despite painted surfaces being the most abundant surface in indoor spaces, surface loss remains one of the largest uncertainties in the indoor ozone budget. Here, ozone uptake coefficients (\u03b3<sub>O3</sub>) on painted surfaces were measured in a flow-through reactor where 79% of the inner surfaces were removable painted glass sheets. Flat white paint initially had a high uptake coefficient (8.3 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>) at 20% RH which plateaued to 1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup> as the paint aged in an indoor office over weeks. Increasing the RH from 0 to 75% increased \u03b3<sub>O3</sub> by a factor of 3.0, and exposure to 134 ppb of \u03b1-terpineol for 1 h increased \u03b3<sub>O3</sub> by a factor of 1.6 at 20% RH. RH also increases \u03b1-terpineol partitioning to paint, further increasing ozone loss, but the type of paint (flat, eggshell, satin, semigloss) had no significant effect. A kinetic multilayer model captures the dependence of \u03b3<sub>O3</sub> on RH and the presence of \u03b1-terpineol, indicating the reacto-diffusive depth for O<sub>3</sub> is 1 to 2 \u03bcm. Given the similarity of the kinetics on aged surfaces across many paint types and the sustained reactivity during aging, these results suggest a mechanism for catalytic loss."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0005-9462-6964"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Downey", "ForeName": "Jillian P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2923-4073"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Lakey", "ForeName": "Pascale S J", "Initials": "PSJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2532-5373"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Shiraiwa", "ForeName": "Manabu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3372-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paint"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "59"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38923518", "10.1021/acs.est.4c02208"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
