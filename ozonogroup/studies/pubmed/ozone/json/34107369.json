Herein, a facile route of hydrothermal method followed by calcination treatment was used to synthesize cubic bixbyite-type (C-In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), rhombohedral corundum-type (Rh-In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the mixed phase In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Rh+C-In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The band gap of C-In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was narrowed to a suitable value (2.38\u00a0eV) and the relative percentage of chemisorbed oxygen was enhanced (31.8%). The sensing results to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) indicated that the C-type structure stood out. The gas sensor based on C-In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibited extraordinary O<sub>3</sub> sensing performances with a response of 5.7 (100 ppb) and an ultralow limit of detection of 30 ppb. The amazing results could be attributed to the narrow band gap and the enrichment of chemisorbed oxygen. This work inspires a new perspective to design highly sensitive and reliable O<sub>3</sub> sensors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
