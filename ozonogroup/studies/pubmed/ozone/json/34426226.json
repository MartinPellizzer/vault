In this study, we integrated observational data, control policies and strategies, and air quality simulations to develop PM<sub>2.5</sub> attainment demonstration by year 2030 for the city of Bengbu, which represents a typical non-compliant city in the northern YRD region. In 2018, the annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in Bengbu was 51.8\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, which was 48\u00a0% higher than the standard of 35\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Different future emission scenarios were developed for year 2025 as mid-term and year 2030 as long-term. Integrated meteorology and air quality modeling system together with monitoring data was applied to predict the air quality under the future emission scenarios. Results show that when a conservative emission reduction ratio of 40\u00a0% was assumed for surrounding regions, the annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in Bengbu could meet the target value by 2030, in which case emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>, NOx, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, VOCs, and NH<sub>3</sub> need to be reduced by 70.6\u00a0%, 43.5\u00a0%, 47.2\u00a0%, 33.4\u00a0%, and 47.5\u00a0%, respectively. PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in Bengbu is not only controlled by local emission reductions but also affected by emission reductions of surrounding regions as well as contribution from long-range transport. More attentions need to be paid to the control of VOCs emissions in the near future to avoid increase of ozone concentrations while reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Our results provide scientific support for the local government to formulate future air pollution prevention and control strategies, sub-regional joint-control among surrounding cities, as well as trans-regional joint-control between the north China and the YRD region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
