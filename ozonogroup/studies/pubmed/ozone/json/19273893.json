Electrical energies required for the effective removal of various PPCPs in secondary effluent were 0.09 kWh/m(3), 0.54 kWh/m(3) and 1.09 kWh/m(3) for O(3), UV/H(2)O(2) and O(3)/UV treatments, respectively, showing that O(3) treatment is the most cost-effective treatment option for the PPCPs removal. O(3) treatment showed the effective PPCPs removal at O(3) dose of 6 mg/L; however, the formation of bromate is expected for O(3) treatment using O(3) dose of more than 4 mg/L. In particular, bromate formation will be a critical issue when the reclaimed water is used for direct/indirect potable reuses. Therefore, in order to suppress the bromate formation as well as achieve the effective PPCPs removal, O(3)/UV treatment will be recommended. UV/H(2)O(2) treatment will be also a profitable treatment method because no bromate will be formed during the process. The evaluation for ecological risk of PPCPs by the applied processes showed that all the processes could decrease the ecological risk caused by parent PPCPs considerably. This means that the investigated treatment processes can play an important role in reducing unpredictable side effects caused by PPCPs in the aquatic environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Quality Management, Kyoto University, 1-2 Yumihama, Otsu, Shiga 520-0811, Japan. jinker123@biwa.eqc.kyoto-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "I H", "Initials": "IH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamashita", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cosmetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cosmetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19273893", "10.2166/wst.2009.076"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
