This incomplete understanding is largely due to the experimental challenges involved in the study of gas-phase reactions of ozone and, in particular, the identification of short-lived reaction intermediates. Here we report direct observation of the stepwise reaction of the halide anions iodide (I-) and bromide (Br-) with ozone to produce XO3- (where X = I and Br, respectively). These results substantially revise the rate constant for the I- + O3 reaction to 1.1 (\u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 (0.13% efficiency) and the Br- + O3 reaction to 6.2 (\u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10-15 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 (0.001% efficiency). Exploiting five-orders of temporal dynamic range on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer enabled explicit measurement of the rate constants for the highly efficient intermediate, XO- + O3 and XO2- + O3, reactions thus confirming a stepwise addition of three oxygen atoms (i.e., X- + 3O3 \u2192 XO3- + 3O2) with the first addition representing the rate determining step. Evidence is also presented for (i) slow reverse reactions of XO- and XO2-, but not XO3-, with molecular oxygen and (ii) the photodissociation of IO-, IO2- and IO3- to release I-. Collectively, these results suggest relatively short lifetimes for Br- and I- in the tropospere with direct gas-phase oxidation by ozone playing a role in both the formation of atmospheric halogen oxides and, conversely, in the ozone depletion associated with springtime polar bromine explosion events."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane QLD 4001, Australia. stephen.blanksby@qut.edu.au berwyck.poad@qut.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Bhujel", "ForeName": "Mahendra", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1711-2338"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane QLD 4001, Australia. stephen.blanksby@qut.edu.au berwyck.poad@qut.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Marshall", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0955-6278"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "LastName": "Maccarone", "ForeName": "Alan T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "LastName": "McKinnon", "ForeName": "Benjamin I", "Initials": "BI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2525-3162"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "LastName": "Trevitt", "ForeName": "Adam J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4284-4474"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "da Silva", "ForeName": "Gabriel", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8560-756X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane QLD 4001, Australia. stephen.blanksby@qut.edu.au berwyck.poad@qut.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Blanksby", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0420-6116"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane QLD 4001, Australia. stephen.blanksby@qut.edu.au berwyck.poad@qut.edu.au."}], "LastName": "Poad", "ForeName": "Berwyck L J", "Initials": "BLJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32363365", "10.1039/d0cp01498b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
