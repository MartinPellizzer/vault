Trihalomethanes (THMs) is one such contaminant of concern in drinking water treatment sector. THMs are the major disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed during the widely used chlorination process. Their identification and removal is of utmost importance in developed as well as developing nations. This study is first of its kind to assess the removal of mixture of urban run-off driven organic matter, agricultural run-off driven organic matter, untreated sewage effluent driven organic matter and little natural organic matter (NOM) (altogether NefOM) (major DBP precursors) using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in the Indian region. Since, NOM vary geographically, this study will add up to applicability of generally utilized AOPs for removal of site explicit (Indian) NefOM. Trihalomethanes at a conventional water treatment plant at Mathura and a moving bed biofilm based non-conventional water treatment plant at Agra were monitored over a year, demonstrating the inability of the water treatment plants to limit formation of DBPs from Yamuna inlet water at any time of the year. Various AOPs (UV-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>) and UV (ultraviolet) photolysis were assessed for their ability to decrease the trihalomethane forming potential (THMFP) by degrading the contaminants in the waters of Yamuna. Kinetic studies were conducted to evaluate the selected AOPs based on their ability to mineralize dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and decrease UV<sub>254</sub> at various pH, UV intensities, and ozone and hydrogen peroxide concentrations. UV-L/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at an intensity of 47\u202fmJ/cm<sup>2</sup>/min, pH\u202f=\u202f7, and at hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.5\u202fmM provided an optimum reduction of DOC (64%) and UV<sub>254</sub> (87%). Fractionation studies indicated that treatment by UV-L/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> leads to the most significant decrease in the hydrophobic fraction of the water, while further study indicated that UV-L/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also showed maximum attenuation of THMFP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
