This study investigated the impacts of virulence factors (VFs) on the removal of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria from municipal wastewater by ozone-free or ozone-encapsulated Fe(III)-coagulant-modified colloidal microbubbles (O<sub>3</sub>_free-CCMBs or O<sub>3</sub>-CCMBs). The highly interface-dependent process was initiated with cell-capture on the microbubble surface where the as-collected cells could be further inactivated with the bubble-released ozone and oxidative species if O<sub>3</sub>-CCMBs were used. The microbiome sequencing analyses denote that the O<sub>3</sub>_free-CCMB performance of antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria removal was dependent on the virulence phenotypes related to cell-surface properties or structures. The adhesion-related VFs facilitated the effective attachment between cells and the coagulant-modified bubble-surface, which further enhanced cell inactivation by bubble-released ozone. On the contrary, the motility-related VFs might help cells to escape from the bubble capture by locomotion; however, this could be overcome by O<sub>3</sub>-CCMB-induced oxidative demolition of the movement structures. Besides, the microbubble performance was also impacted with the cell-membrane structure related to antibiotic resistance (i.e., efflux pumps) and the dissolved organic matter through promoting the surface-capture and decreasing the oxidation efficacy. The ozone-encapsulated microbubbles with surface functionalization are robust and promising tools in hampering antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity dissemination from wastewater to surface water environment; and awareness should be raised for the influence of virulence signatures on its performance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
