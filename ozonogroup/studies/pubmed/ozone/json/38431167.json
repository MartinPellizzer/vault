Composting is considered a promising and economically feasible strategy for the treatment of organic waste. However, recent research indicates that composting is a source of N<sub>2</sub>O, contributing to atmospheric pollution and greenhouse effect. Consequently, there is a need for the development of effective, cost-efficient methodologies to quantify N<sub>2</sub>O emissions accurately. In this study, we employed the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) method to improve the performance of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions prediction during manure composting. The highest R<sup>2</sup> and lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values achieved were 0.939 and 18.42\u00a0mg d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Five machine learning methods including the backpropagation neural network, extreme learning machine, integrated machine learning method based on ELM and random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and extreme gradient boosting were adopted for comparison to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the MAML prediction model. Feature analysis showed that moisture content of structure material and ammonium concentration during composting process were the two most significant features affecting N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. This study serves as proof of the application of MAML during N<sub>2</sub>O emissions prediction, further giving new insights into the effects of manure material properties and composting process data on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. This approach helps determining the strategies for mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
