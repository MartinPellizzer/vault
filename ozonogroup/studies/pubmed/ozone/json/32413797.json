Ozonation is a promising process for CGW treatment. In this study, the effects of ozone concentration, pH, and ozonation time on CGW treatment were investigated. The results confirmed that CGW was degraded effectively and that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) was reduced from 1057 to 362 mgL<sup>-1</sup>, utilizing 50 mgL<sup>-1</sup> ozone for 90\u00a0min. Further, the color of CGW changed from brown to clear and colorless, and the pH decreased from 8.5 to 4.7. Importantly, molds were observed in the oxidized CGW after 14\u00a0d\u00a0at room temperature (23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C), indicating that CGW is significantly biodegradable by ozonation. The CGW components were extracted with three different organic solvents (chloroform, n-hexane, and benzene), and their compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) before and after ozonation. The results proved that considerable amounts of highly toxic refractory compounds in CGW, such as phenolic compounds, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds (NHCs), were degraded to compounds that included olefins, carboxylic acids, and cycloalkanes, or minerals, which are relatively environmentally benign. Moreover, the number of substances in CGW decreased significantly from 127 to 74 after ozonation. Summarily, ozonation is a promising approach for the treatment of highly toxic refractory wastewater, such as CGW."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
