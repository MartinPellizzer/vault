Ozone concentration was maintained at 100 +/- 5 nl l-1 and NAI at 106 ml-1. When exposed to a combination of ozone and NAI, viability among all three bacterial species decreased more rapidly when they were inoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) than onto nutrient agar (NA). A subsequent test examined the effect of ozone and NAI alone or in combination on the bacteria inoculated onto PDA only. Treatment with NAI alone had no killing effect on any of the bacterial species. However, a strong interaction between ozone and NAI was observed. Pseudomonas fluorescens was most susceptible to the combined treatment. Cell viability was reduced to 0.7% after 6 h, while 76% of the cells remained viable when exposed to ozone alone. Viability of Erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora was reduced to 4% after 6 h in the combined treatment compared with 69% when exposed to ozone alone. Escherichia coli was relatively more resistant to the combined treatment; viability was reduced to 40% after 11 h compared with 70% in the ozone alone treatment.", "A strong synergism between ozone and NAI on bacterial cell death was found, but the degree of this effect varied depending on bacterial species.", "The synergism of ozone with NAI may provide an effective method of reducing food-borne disease and decay of fresh produce."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre, Kentville, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hildebrand", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forney", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Pectobacterium carotovorum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas fluorescens"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12067383", "10.1046/j.1365-2672.2002.01683.x", "1683"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
