Environmental O3 exposure is associated with many symptoms related to respiratory disorders, which include loss of lung function, exacerbation of asthma, airway damage, and lung inflammation. The effects of O3 are not restricted to the respiratory system or function - adverse effects within the central nervous system (CNS) such as decreased cognitive response, decrease in motor activity, headaches, disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, neuronal dysfunctions, cell degeneration, and neurochemical alterations have also been described; furthermore, it has also been proposed that O3 could have epigenetic effects. O3 exposure induces the reactive chemical species in the lungs, but the short half-life of these chemical species has led some authors to attribute the injurious mechanisms observed within the lungs to inflammatory processes. However, the damage to the CNS induced by O3 exposure is not well understood. In this review, the basic mechanisms of inflammation and activation of the immune system by O3 exposure are described and the potential mechanisms of damage, which include neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and the signs and symptoms of disturbances within the CNS caused by environmental O3 exposure are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departtamento de Neurofisiologia, Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia, MVS Insurgentes, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez-Lazcano", "ForeName": "Juan Carlos", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Guevara", "ForeName": "Edith", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "del Carmen Rubio", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Franco-P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "Javier", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Custodio", "ForeName": "Ver\u00f3nica", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Cer\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Miguel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Livera", "ForeName": "Carlos", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Paz", "ForeName": "Carlos", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Rev Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8711016", "ISSNLinking": "0334-1763"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23585211", "10.1515/revneuro-2012-0084", "/j/revneuro.ahead-of-print/revneuro-2012-0084/revneuro-2012-0084.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
