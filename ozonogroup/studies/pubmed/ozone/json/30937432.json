In this study, we investigated ozone for the management of the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a serious stored product insect pest. We exposed eggs, immature stages within wheat kernels, and adults of the rice weevil to 200-ppm ozone for 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h. Insects were placed at 5, 15, or 25 cm depth within a wheat mass in PVC pipes (10 cm in diameter, 30 cm in height) and exposed to ozone. Egg eclosion was recorded 10 d after treatment (DAT), and immature stages were observed for adult emergence 28 DAT. Adults were observed for survival immediately after ozone exposure and again at 1 and 2 DAT. Egg eclosion was significantly lower at 5 cm compared with 25 cm at all exposure times, but not the 12-h exposure time. For each exposure time tested, significantly lesser adults developed from kernels and none of the adults survived at the 5 cm depth compared with the 15 and 25 cm depths. Survival rate of adults was significantly higher at 25 cm depth than at 15 cm depth at the 24-60 h. The deeper the insect in the grain mass, the higher the survival rate. The work reported suggests that ozone is effective in killing all life stages of S. oryzae; however, the efficacy of the gas is dependent on the concentration, exposure time, depth, and gas loss."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
