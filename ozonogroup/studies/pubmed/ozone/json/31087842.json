However, there is little research on the environmental impact of volatile organic compounds from fossil fuel combustion emissions. In this paper, ozone formation potential(OFP)and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) of VOCs from fossil fuel combustion in Lanzhou city were calculated. The OFP and SOAFP of the cement industry were the largest, representing 45.3% and 50.9%, respectively, followed by brick and tile industries. However, when the calculations were based on tons of standard coal equivalent, the largest contributors to OFP and SOAFP of VOCs emitted from combustion were the brick and tile industries, and the smallest was the natural gas industry. VOCs from fossil fuel combustion of power plants and industry enterprises in the Xigu District are the main contributors to the OFP and SOAFP in the urban district of Lanzhou city. The contribution rates of the aromatic hydrocarbons from fossil fuel to OFP and SOAFP account for 40.0% and 67.2%, respectively. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also the main component in the top 10 species that contribute to OFP and SOAFP. The mass ratio of OFP and SOAFP per VOCs from fossil fuel combustion (2.58 t\u00b7t<sup>-1</sup>, 3.16 kg\u00b7t<sup>-1</sup>) is larger than those from biomass combustion (2.22 t\u00b7t<sup>-1</sup>, 1.38 kg\u00b7t<sup>-1</sup>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yu-Fan", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Wen-Kai", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087842", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201809129"]}}]}
