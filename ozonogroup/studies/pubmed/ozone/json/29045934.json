Results showed that the genotoxicity increased after MPUV irradiation (10-100\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>), but declined when adopting other disinfection processes. The effectiveness of genotoxicity reduction by five chemical disinfectants was identified as: O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0pre-ozonation with Cl<sub>2</sub>\u00a0\u2248\u00a0ClO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0combination of ClO<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0Cl<sub>2</sub>. The sequential combination of MPUV, Cl<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> reduced the genotoxicity to a level similar to the source water. The influence of differential disinfection process varied on iodinated wastewater, which is closely related to the competitive reactions between disinfectants, iodine and dissolved organic matters. The removal of genotoxic pollutants and the formation of genotoxic disinfection by-products are the two major factors that lead to the change in genotoxicity during disinfection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
