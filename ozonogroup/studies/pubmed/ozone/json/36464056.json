In recent years, unexpected halocarbon emissions have been found in Asia, raising concerns about ozone recovery. As a number of studies focused on halocarbon variations and source profiles, there is an increasing need to identify halocarbon source origins. In this study, an eight-month regular air sampling was conducted at a coastal site in Hong Kong from November 2020 to June 2021, and seventeen halocarbon species were selected for extensive investigation after advanced sample analysis in our laboratory. The temporal variations of halocarbon mixing ratio enhancements were analyzed, and the spatial variations of source origins were investigated by wind sectors and backward trajectory statistics. Our results indicate lower enhancements beyond the background values for major regulated CFCs and CCl<sub>4</sub> than later controlled HCFCs and HFCs, suggesting the greater progress of Montreal Protocol implementation for the former species. The notable high enhancement values of non-regulated halocarbons from the north direction indicate their widespread usage in China. The source apportionment analysis estimates the contributions from six emission sectors on measured halocarbons, including solvent usage (43.57 \u00b1 4.08 %), refrigerant residues (17.05 \u00b1 5.71 %), cleaning agent/chemical production (13.18 \u00b1 4.76 %), refrigerant replacements (13.06 \u00b1 2.13 %), solvent residues (8.65 \u00b1 3.28 %), and foaming agent (4.49 \u00b1 1.08 %). Trajectories statistical analysis suggests that industrial solvent was mainly contributed by eastern China (i.e., Shandong and YRD), cleaning agent/chemical production was spread over southeast China (i.e., YRD and Fujian), and refrigeration replacements were dominant in Hong Kong surrounding regions. This work provides insight into the progress made in implementing the Montreal Protocol in Hong Kong and the surrounding region and the importance of continuous emission control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
