From before to after the control measure on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fueled vehicles, the VOCs originated from LPG vehicle exhaust deceased from 41.3\u00b11.2\u03bcg/m(3) (49.7\u00b11.5%) to 32.8\u00b11.4\u03bcg/m(3) (38.8\u00b11.7%) (p<0.05). In contrast, the contribution to VOCs made by gasoline and diesel vehicle exhaust and solvent usage increased (p<0.05). VOCs and nitric oxide (NO) in LPG source experienced the highest reductions at the roadside sites, while the variations were not significant at the urban and new town sites (p>0.05). For O3 production, LPG vehicle exhaust generally made a negative contribution (-0.17\u00b10.06 ppbv) at the roadside sites, however it turned to a slightly positive contribution (0.004\u00b10.038 ppbv) after the control measure. At the urban sites, although the reductions of VOCs and NO were minor (p>0.05), O3 produced by LPG vehicle significantly reduced from 4.19\u00b11.92 ppbv to 0.95\u00b10.38 ppbv (p<0.05). Meanwhile, O3 produced by LPG at the new town sites remained stable. The analysis of O3-precursor relationships revealed that alkenes and aromatics were the main species limiting roadside O3 formation, while aromatics were the most predominant controlling factor at urban and new town sites. In contrast, isoprene and sometimes NOx limited the O3 formation in rural environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
