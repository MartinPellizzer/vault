In 2018, the NNEC experienced a record-breaking summer of the past 40 years. Influenced by the abnormal high temperatures, a regional ozone event occurred on 2-3 August, over 63% of 79 selected cities in the NNEC were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and the maximum value of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> reached 268 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Observations indicated that ozone concentrations agree well with the maximum temperature at 2 meters (MT2M) over NNEC with a correlation coefficient of 0.69. During the pollution episode, strong downdraft in the local high (35\u00b0N-42.5\u00b0N, 112.5\u00b0E-132.5\u00b0E; LH) over the NNEC created the favourable meteorological conditions for O<sub>3</sub> formation. By analyzing the horizontal wind and wave activity fluxes (WAFs) at 200 hPa, we found that the LH formation was resulted from the Rossby wave propagation from upstream along the mid-latitude Asian jet. The split polar vortex intrusion further strengthened the amplitude of the Rossby wave and reinforced the LH. Moreover, a secondary circulation between Typhoon Jongdari and the LH contributed to the enhanced LH with strong subsidence. On the other hand, the stratospheric intrusions under the deep subsidence also contributed to the enhanced surface O<sub>3</sub>. In this study, the deep-seated meteorological dynamical mechanisms contributing to the abnormal high temperatures were investigated, which can lead to a better understanding of the regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution over NNEC under the global-warming background."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
