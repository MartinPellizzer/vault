A facile, sensitive, and selective micromethod has been developed and validated for quantification of S-nitrosothiols as their mercury-displaceable nitrogen monoxide content. In this method, brief (5-min), room-temperature pretreatment of S-nitrosothiol with a molar excess of aqueous mercuric chloride was used to liberate into solution, quantitatively, the nitrogen monoxide moiety, which rapidly and quantitatively converted to its stable solution end-product, nitrite. Solution nitrite was reduced back to nitric oxide with vanadium(III), and the nitric oxide was detected by gas-phase chemiluminescence after reaction with ozone in a commercial nitric oxide analyzer. A linear relationship was observed between S-nitrosothiol-bound nitrogen monoxide and ozone-chemiluminescent detector response over a wide range (16.3-3500 pmol) of nitric oxide, as generated by reaction of vanadium(III) with either nitrite standard or mercury-treated S-nitrosothiol. Assay response was quantitatively identical for equivalent amounts of nitrite and S-nitrosothiol-bound nitrogen monoxide. The method displayed 96% selectivity for nitrite vs. nitrate and negligible (<2%) interference by nitrosated compounds bearing nitrogen monoxide moieties bound to either nitrogen or carbon. The lower limits of quantitative sensitivity and qualitative detection were below 50 and 20 pmol S-nitrosothiol-bound nitrogen monoxide-equivalents, respectively. The intraday and interday coefficients of variation did not exceed 8%. This technique has been applied to quantify structurally diverse natural and synthetic S-nitrosothiols with quantitative recovery from complex biological samples such as culture media and plasma at levels of nitrogen monoxide-equivalents undetectable by the popular Saville colorimetric method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NitroMed, Inc., Bedford, MA 01730, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ewing", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janero", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8709159", "ISSNLinking": "0891-5849"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "S-Nitrosothiols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00J9J9XKDE", "NameOfSubstance": "Vanadium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53GH7MZT1R", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercuric Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60-24-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercaptoethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67616-44-8", "NameOfSubstance": "S-nitrosomercaptoethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mercaptoethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mercuric Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "S-Nitrosothiols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vanadium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9741600", "10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00083-5", "S0891-5849(98)00083-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
