The primary outcome measure was the change in wound size after the intervention compared to pretreatment. Secondary outcomes included time to complete ulcer healing, number of healed patients, adverse events, amputation rates, and hospital length of stay. Quantitative data synthesis for the meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model and generic inverse variance method, while overall heterogeneity analysis was conducted using a fixed-effects model. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 index (<50%) and the Cochrane Q statistic test. Sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave-one-out method.", "The meta-analysis included 11 studies comprising 960 patients with DFU. The results demonstrated a significant positive effect of ozone therapy on reducing foot ulcer size (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD): -25.84, 95% CI: -51.65 to -0.04, p = 0.05), shortening mean healing time (SMD: -38.59, 95% CI: -51.81 to -25.37, p < 0.001), decreasing hospital length of stay (SMD: -8.75, 95% CI: -14.81 to -2.69, p < 0.001), and reducing amputation rates (Relative Risk (RR): 0.46, 95% CI: 0.30-0.71, p < 0.001), compared to standard treatment.", "This meta-analysis indicates that ozone therapy has additional benefits in expediting complete DFU healing, reducing the amputation rates, and decreasing hospital length of stay, though its effects do not differ from standard treatments for complete ulcer resolution. Further research is needed to address the heterogeneity among studies and to better understand the potential beneficial effects of ozone therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Life Style Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Izadi", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Nursing, Atherosclerosis Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari-Oori", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Department, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Eftekhari", "ForeName": "Zohre", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Life Style Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Nematollah Jonaidi", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthopedic Department, Trauma Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Maybodi", "ForeName": "Mohamad Kazem-Emami", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trauma Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heydari", "ForeName": "Soleyman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nursing Faculty, Trauma Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahedian-Azimi", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland-Bahrain, Adliya, Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain."}], "LastName": "Atkin", "ForeName": "Stephen L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International UNESCO Center for Health-related Basic Sciences and Human Nutrition, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jamialahmadi", "ForeName": "Tannaz", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38982924", "10.2174/0113816128302890240521065453", "CPD-EPUB-141508"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
