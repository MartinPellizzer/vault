This design allowed us to test whether O(3) exposure or drought, or both, affected root antioxidants during the growing season. In both years, root ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol showed a similar relationship with volumetric soil water content (SWC): ascorbate concentrations on a root dry mass basis increased from about 6 to 12 micromol g(-1) when SWC dropped from 25 to 20%, and a-tocopherol increased from 100 to 150 nmol g(-1) at SWC values below 20%. Root glutathione showed no relationship with SWC or differences between the dry and the average year, but it was significantly and consistently diminished by 2x[O(3)]. Our results were inconclusive as to whether shoot-root translocation of glutathione or glutathione production in the roots was diminished. Phloem glutathione concentrations in the canopy remained constant, but reduced transport velocity in the phloem and, as a consequence, reduced mass flow of glutathione cannot be ruled out."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forest Botany and Tree Physiology, Chair of Tree Physiology, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haberer", "ForeName": "Kristine", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herbinger", "ForeName": "Karin", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alexou", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rennenberg", "ForeName": "Heinz", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tausz", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H4N855PNZ1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Tocopherol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disasters"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phloem"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Tocopherol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18316303", "10.1093/treephys/28.5.713"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
