This study aims to explore the effectiveness and potential applications of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against chlorine-resistant Bacillus and its spores in water, providing new insights for the control of chlorine-resistant bacteria and improving the biological stability of distribution systems. The inactivation effects of EGCG on Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and its spores were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, ATP measurement, and transcriptome sequencing analysis to determine changes in surface structure, energy metabolism, and gene expression levels, thereby elucidating the inactivation mechanism. The results demonstrate the potential application of EGCG in continuously inhibiting chlorine-resistant B. subtilis in water, effectively improving the biological stability of the distribution system. However, EGCG is not suitable for treating raw water with high spore content and is more suitable as a supplementary disinfectant for processes with strong spore removal capabilities, such as ozone, ultraviolet, or ultrafiltration. EGCG exhibits a disruptive effect on the morphological structure and energy metabolism of B. subtilis and suppresses the synthesis of substances, energy metabolism, and normal operation of the antioxidant system by inhibiting the expression of multiple genes, thereby achieving the inactivation of B. subtilis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
