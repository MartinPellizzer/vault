We identified all live-born preterm infants in California from 2007 to 2012 in a population-based administrative data set and linked them to a data set measuring several air quality and sociodemographic indicators at the census tract level. All sociodemographic and air quality predictors were divided into quartiles (first quartile most favourable to the fourth quartile least favourable). Mixed effect logistic models to account for clustering at the census tract level were used to investigate associations between chronic air quality and sociodemographic indicators respiratory hospital admission during the first year of life.", "Of 205\u00a0178 preterm infants, 5.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0033) were admitted to the hospital for respiratory causes during the first year. In the univariate analysis, comparing the first to the fourth quartile of chronic ozone (risk ratio [RR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21, 1.37), diesel (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02, 1.17) and particulate matter 2.5 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01, 1.14) exposure were associated with hospital admission during the first year. Following adjustment for confounders, the risk ratios for hospital admission during the first year were 1.53 (95% CI 1.37, 1.72) in relation to educational attainment (per cent of the population over age 25 with less than a high school education) and 1.23 (95% CI 1.09, 1.38) for poverty (per cent of the population living below two times the federal poverty level).", "Among preterm infants,
