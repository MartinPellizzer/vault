Migration and capture of active electrons are central to catalytic ozonation reactions, which was not studied or reviewed more clearly. Based on this perspective, the catalytic ozonation potential of 2D-LCMs synthesized by numerous methods is firstly contrasted to guide the design of subsequent carbon based-catalysts, and not limited to 2D-LCMs. Matching ROS to active sites is a key step in understanding the catalytic mechanism. The structure-activity relationships between reported numerous active sites and ROS evolution is then constructed. Result showed that OH could be produced by -OH, -C=O, -COOH groups, defective sites, immobilized metal atoms, doped heteroatoms and photo-induced electrons; and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> could be produced by -OH groups and sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded carbon. The normalized model further be used to visually compare the contribution degree of various regulatory methods to performance improvement. More importantly, this review calls for 2D-LCMs-based catalytic ozonation to be studied without circumventing the issue of structural stability, which would lead to many proposals of catalysts and its involved catalytic reaction mechanism being meaningless."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
