PCBW was characterized with low pH value (2.11) and high concentration of TDS (50190 mg L(-1)), copper (4190 mg L(-1)) and iron (2660 mg L(-1)). Waste base (WB), by-product of the alumina production, and waste sludge, by-product of the electrochemical treatment of groundwater, were employed as neutralization/adsorption agents. Due to its high neutralization capacity WB was used for pH adjustment to pH 8 and heavy metals removal from both effluents, yet the final removal of the contaminants down to the regulated values was assessed by adsorption/coagulation with the iron and aluminum rich waste sludge. Following the combined treatment the removal efficiency of iron and copper was higher than 99.99% with their final concentration in the treated water of 0.151 mg L(-1) and 0.129 mg L(-1), respectively. Following the ozone base oxidation the removal efficiency of the organic contaminants was more than 83%. The successful application of the industrial waste by-products for neutralization/purification of the PCBW with the removal efficiencies of the contaminants comparable or better than those obtained with conventional treatment represented the main advantage of our presented method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Advanced Energy Ltd. , Zagreb , Croatia."}], "LastName": "Orescanin", "ForeName": "Visnja", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kollar", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Halkijevic", "ForeName": "Ivan", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuspilic", "ForeName": "Marin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Flegar", "ForeName": "Vanja", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Croatia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electronics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24410684", "10.1080/10934529.2014.859034"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
