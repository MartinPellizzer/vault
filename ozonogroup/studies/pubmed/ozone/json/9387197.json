For healthy subjects in the Balmes study, IL-6 and a2M, but not IL-8, increased in association with ozone exposure. Statistical analyses suggested that effects of ozone on IL-8 levels observed in the first exposure and bronchoscopy may have carried over to the second exposure and bronchoscopy, which may have obscured an effect of ozone on IL-8 after the second exposure. For asthmatic subjects in the Balmes study, IL-6 and IL-8 increased in both bronchial and alveolar lavage fluid, but not in proximal airway lavage fluid. The mean interval between exposures was longer for asthmatic subjects than for healthy subjects, and no carryover effects were seen. When the Balmes and Frampton data were analyzed together, subject groups in the two studies (nonsmokers, smokers, and subjects without and with asthma) did not differ significantly in the response of cytokines to ozone exposure. The finding of possible carryover effects in one group suggests that subtle effects of ozone exposure, or bronchoscopy including proximal airway lavage and biopsy, or both, may persist for three weeks in some subjects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frampton", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balmes", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krein", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Speers", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Utell", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Res Rep Health Eff Inst", "NlmUniqueID": "8812230", "ISSNLinking": "1041-5505"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Macroglobulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biopsy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Interpretation, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Macroglobulins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9387197"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
