Using cyclic voltammetry, we demonstrate the redox properties of the I<sub>2</sub>/2I<sup>-</sup> couple, which facilitates NO<sub>2</sub> reduction into soluble NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and catalyst regeneration through sulfite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>)-driven reduction, thus establishing a closed catalytic cycle within the components of flue gas. In lab-scale wet-scrubbing tests, we explore the effect of various operational parameters (i.e., KI concentration, pH, and SO<sub>2</sub> concentration), with a 15\u00a0h stability test demonstrating >60% NO<sub>x</sub> and >99% SO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiency when the pH is controlled between 7.5 and 8.5. A successful pilot-scale implementation conducted at an inlet flow rate of 1000\u00a0m<sup>3</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> further confirmed the reproducibility of the proposed redox-catalytic cycle. Our study offers a cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable solution for effectively mitigating NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions at low temperatures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
