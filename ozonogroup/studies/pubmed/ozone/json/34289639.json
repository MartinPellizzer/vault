This refinery emits 1859.2 tons of VOCs per year, with wastewater collection and treatment system being the largest emissions source, accounting for 59.6% individually, followed by the recirculating cooling water system (13.4%), storage tanks (11.1%), and equipment leaks (9.4%). Organized and fugitive samples were collected simultaneously for different processes of each emissions source. A total of 100 VOC species were characterized and quantified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection system. The VOC emissions concentrations and chemical composition of each process were quite different. Most of the processes used alkanes as the main chemome. We concluded from the composite source profile weighted by the amount of VOC emissions that the characteristic species of this petroleum refinery were ethane (15.4%), propylene (11.7%), propane (8.5%), iso-pentane (8.3%), and toluene (4.7%). The ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP) were evaluated, and the results indicated that alkenes (mainly propylene) and aromatics (mainly toluene) were the priority control compounds. This study clarifies the current status of VOC emissions in the refinery in terms of emissions intensity, emissions components, and O<sub>3</sub> and SOA reactivity. The key emissions sources and species screened provide scientific support for reducing refined emissions from the petrochemical industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
