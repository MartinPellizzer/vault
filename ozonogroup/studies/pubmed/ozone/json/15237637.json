Their presence in the drinking water, even at low levels (ng/L), can be detected and it creates consumer complaints. So those concentrations have to be controlled as low as possible in the drinking water. The removals by oxidation (O3, Cl2, ClO2) and adsorption (PAC, filter/adsorber) were studied at laboratory and pilot plant (50 m3/d) to select suitable 2-MIB and geosmin treatment processes. The following conclusions were derived from the study. Both of the threshold odor levels for 2-MIB and geosmin appeared to be 30 ng/L as a consequence of a lab test. For any given PAC dosage in a jar-test, removal efficiencies of 2-MIB and geosmin were increased in proportion to PAC dosage and were independent of their initial concentration in raw water for the tested PAC dosages. In comparison of geosmin with 2-MIB, the adsorption efficiency of geosmin by PAC was superior to that of 2-MIB. The required PAC dosages to control below the threshold odor level were 30 mg/L for geosmin and 50 mg/L for 2-MIB at 100 ng/L of initial concentration. Removal efficiencies of odor materials by Cl2, ClO2, and O3 were very weak under the limited dosage (1.5 mg/L), however increased ozone dosage (3.8 mg O3/L) showed high removal efficiency (84.8% for 2-MIB) at contact time 6.4 minutes. According to the initial concentrations of 2-MIB and geosmin, their removal efficiencies by filter/adsorber differed from 25.7% to 88.4%. For all those, however, remaining concentrations of target materials in finished waters were maintained below 30 ng/L. The longer run-time given for the filter/adsorber, the higher the effluent concentration generated. So it is necessary that the run-time of the filter/adsorber be decreased, when 2-MIB or geosmin occurs in raw water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korea Water Resources Corporation, San 88-5 Sasong-dong Soojung-gu, Sungnam-city Kyungkido, Korea. 92jsw@netian.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2371-42-8", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methylisoborneol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MYW912WXJ4", "NameOfSubstance": "geosmin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15237637"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
