Mountainous regions such as the Laurentians (Quebec), Appalachians (N.Y.) and the Green Mountains (Vermont) are especially vulnerable, with both conifers and hardwoods being affected. Ongoing measurements of atmospheric chemistry (e.g. The Chemistry of High Elevation Fog-CHEF project of the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service) reveal that extreme cloudwater events of less than pH 3.0 and ozone episodes in excess of 100 ppb are common occurrences. The purpose of this study was to gather information about the response of epiphytic lichens to deteriorating air quality at selected locations for which atmospheric chemical data are readily available. A multidisciplinary approach is being used to analyse the lichens.Morphological and cellular aberrations previously documented by the authors to occur in terricolous lichens exposed to simulated acidic rain events will be evaluated for their usefulness are early warning indicators of forest decline. In addition, tissue chemistry of species such as Hypogymnia physodes will be correlated with parameters such as altitude and decline index and compared with published elemental values for lichens from similarly polluted sites in Europe and Scandinavia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Studies, University of Toronto, M5S 1A4, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scott", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hutchinson", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1982 Nov 12;218(4573):677-80", "ArticleIdList": ["17791587"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24241644", "10.1007/BF00394887"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
