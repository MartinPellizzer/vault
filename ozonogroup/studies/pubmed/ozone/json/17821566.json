The peak intensity of the light emission is related quantitatively to the amount of compound. Many compounds can be identified by this method, and some are listed. Sensitivity of detection approximates that of fluorescence methods and extends to less-than- nanogram quantities for some compounds. Ozoneinduced chemiluminescence of compounds in acetone solution was less sensitive than it was in the dry analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bowman", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1966", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1966", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1966", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17821566", "10.1126/science.154.3755.1454", "154/3755/1454"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
