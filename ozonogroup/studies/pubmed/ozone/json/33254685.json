In this study, rice yield and the associated economic losses due to O<sub>3</sub> were estimated by using observational O<sub>3</sub> concentration ([O<sub>3</sub>]) data during growing seasons in Southern China. O<sub>3</sub>-induced yield losses were calculated by using O<sub>3</sub> exposure metrics of AOT40 and M7. The spatial distribution of these two metrics is relatively consistent, the highest areas located in the Yangtze River Basin. Under the current O<sub>3</sub> level, during double-early rice, double-late rice and single rice growing seasons, the relative yield losses estimated with AOT40 (M7) were 6.8% (1.2%), 10.2% (1.9%) and 10.4% (2.0%), respectively. O<sub>3</sub>-induced rice production loss for double-early rice, double-late rice and single rice totaled 2.4 million metric tons (0.4 million metric tons), 4.3 million metric tons (0.7 million metric tons) and 11.0 million metric tons (1.9 million metric tons) and associated economic losses were 108.1 million USD (18.3 million USD), 190.2 million USD (32.4 million USD) and 486.4 million USD (82.9 million USD) based on AOT40 (M7) metric. This study indicates that regional risks to rice from O<sub>3</sub> exposure and provide quantitative evidence of O<sub>3</sub>-induced impacts on rice yields and economic losses across Southern China. Therefore, the establishment of scientific O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment method is of great significance to prevent yield production and economic losses caused by O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Policymakers should strengthen supervision of emissions of O<sub>3</sub> precursors to mitigate the rise of O<sub>3</sub> concentration, thereby reducing O<sub>3</sub> damage to agricultural production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
