Since the reported odour thresholds of geosmin and 2-MIB are as low as 4 and 8.5 ng/L, respectively, they are not readily removed by conventional water treatment processes. In this study, ozone (O3) and ferrate (Fe(VI)) were applied to oxidise geosmin and 2-MIB. Their performances were compared in terms of removal efficiency of geosmin and 2-MIB. In the case of O3, removal efficiency of geosmin and 2-MIB ozonation at different initial O3 doses, H2O2/O3 ratios and water temperatures were evaluated. The oxidation rates of geosmin and 2-MIB by Fe(VI) were measured within pH 6-8. The effect of H2O2 addition was also evaluated. In summary, O3, especially with H2O2, could almost completely oxidise geosmin and 2-MIB, while Fe(VI) could not oxidise them more than 25% at any pH that was considered in this study. This was attributed to the structure of the organics and high reaction selectivity of Fe(VI). Further study should be conducted to find the reason of inhibition of oxidation by Fe(VI)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The University of Seoul, Dept. of Environmental Engineering, 90 Jeonnong-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-743, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Go", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16836-06-9", "NameOfSubstance": "ferrate ion"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2371-42-8", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methylisoborneol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MYW912WXJ4", "NameOfSubstance": "geosmin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17489401", "10.2166/wst.2007.170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
