In this study a microfluidic derivatisation technique combined with GC-MS has been developed to measure gaseous I2. Good linearity in the range of 0.2-416 ppb and low detection limits varying from 6 to 25 ppt for different derivatisation reagents have been achieved, which is a substantial improvement in sensitivity compared with the spectrophotometric method (detection limit of 1.20 ppb) in our previous study [L.J. Carpenter, S.M. MacDonald, M.D. Shaw, R. Kumar, R.W. Saunders, R. Parthipan, J. Wilson, J.M.C. Plane, Nature Geoscience, 6 (2013) 108-111]. The microfluidic technique was employed to quantify I2 produced from the heterogeneous reactions of potassium iodide solution and ozone. Good agreement was observed between the results of the microfluidic technique and the simulation of a coupled surface water-air kinetic model in the amount of I2 produced on the ozonolysis of iodide solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Authors.
