Binary logistic regression was used to examine trimester-specific associations between per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in air pollutants and CHDs as well as the major subtypes. Distributed lag models incorporating logistic regression were applied to explore weekly-specific associations.", "A total of 196,069 singleton live births were included during 2013-2018, 643 CHDs were identified (3.3\u2030). We found that first and second trimester CO exposure increased overall CHDs risk, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 1.066 (1.010-1.125) and 1.065 (1.012-1.122). For CHDs subtypes, we observed that NO<sub>2</sub> and CO in first trimester, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> in the second trimester exposure were associated with the risk of atrial septal defect (ASD), the susceptible windows of air pollutants and ASD mainly occurred in the 1st- 6th gestational weeks. No positive association was observed for air pollution and tetralogy of Fallot.", "Our findings suggest that ambient air pollution exposure is associated with the risk of CHDs especially for ASD, and the susceptible windows generally occurred in first trimester. Further well-designed longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm our findings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
