However, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether temperature can modify the effects of ozone on health.", "Short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> in the Beijing Municipality, Tianjin Municipality, Hebei Province, and surrounding areas was associated with an increased risk of human mortality and that association was positive modified by relatively higher (>75th 24 h-average temperature) or extreme cold temperature (<10th 24 h-average temperature). Under extreme temperatures (>90th 24 h-average temperature) modification, the associations were further increased. Cardiopulmonary diseases, as vulnerable diseases of air pollution, their mortality risks associated with O<sub>3</sub> were markedly strengthened by uncomfortable temperatures.", "This study suggests that policymakers should pay attention to the synergistic effect between ozone and heat or extreme cold on human health, as well as provide evidence for establishing an integrated early-warning system to protect the public against both uncomfortable temperature and air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright and License information: Editorial Office of CCDCW, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Wanying", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tiantian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xiaoming", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "China CDC Wkly", "NlmUniqueID": "101767554", "ISSNLinking": "2096-7071"}, "CoiStatement": "No conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Vicedo-Cabrera AM, Sera F, Liu C, Armstrong B, Milojevic A, Guo YM, et al Short term association between ozone and mortality: global two stage time series study in 406 locations in 20 countries.
