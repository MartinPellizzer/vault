For this, the kinetics and mechanisms of the photochemical and photocatalytic degradation of selected oxygenated solvents by common tropospheric oxidants (such as OH and ozone) must be characterized. We studied the oxidation kinetics of new oxygenated solvents as pure organic liquids and in an aqueous medium by ozone and bythe OH radical, respectively. The studied chemicals are all unsaturated compounds, having none, one, or two ether groups. The results indicate that the OH reaction proceeds atthe diffusion limit by addition to the double bond. The reactive uptake coefficients associated with the reaction initiated by ozone are of the order of 10(-3). The reactions of compounds with two double bonds are very fast and probably occur at the surface. This kinetic information demonstrates that organic solvents in an organic medium or in an aqueous droplet will be oxidized rapidly by these oxidation reactions. These reactions, however, are not significant sinks for ozone and OH radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot 76100, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moise", "ForeName": "Tamar", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rudich", "ForeName": "Yinon", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rousse", "ForeName": "Davy", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16082948", "10.1021/es048488h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
