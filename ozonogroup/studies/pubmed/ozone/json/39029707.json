Given their nutritional richness, legume seeds are widely esteemed as a crucial dietary staple worldwide, prized for their abundance of oil, protein, dietary fiber, and low-fat characteristics. Termed as the \"poor man's meat\" due to their high-quality protein, they hold immense economic value. Acknowledging the significance of legumes, a field experiment was conducted to understand the physiological and antioxidant responses, stomatal characteristics, and yield response in three cultivars of Pisum sativum L. (K Agaiti, K Uday and K Damini), exposed to elevated ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). In the present study, Pisum sativum cultivars were subjected to ambient (control) and elevated (+15\u00a0ppb) concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, using separate sets of OTCs. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> stimulated the activity of the enzymes of Halliwell Asada pathway, which were responsible for the differential response of the three experimental cultivars. While K Agaiti and K Uday focused on upregulating their antioxidant defense, K Damini followed the strategy of biomass allocation. Test weight showed that K Damini was most efficient in succoring the yield losses under elevated O<sub>3</sub>. Under elevated O<sub>3</sub>, test weight reduced by 8.91%, 7.52%, and 5.1%, respectively, in K Agaiti, followed by K Uday and K Damini, rendering K Agaiti most sensitive to O<sub>3</sub> stress. The present study not only helps us to elucidate the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity of the selected experimental cultivars, it also helps us in screening O<sub>3</sub> tolerant cultivars for future agricultural practices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
