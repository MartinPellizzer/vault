Electric field treatment inactivates bacteria by physically disrupting the integrity of the cell membrane. Assisted by nanowire-modified electrodes, locally enhanced electric field treatment (LEEFT) reduces the required voltage to several volts to induce sufficient electric field strength for efficient bacteria inactivation. In this study, the LEEFT is applied as a pretreatment of ozonation for bacteria inactivation. Our results show that a low-voltage (<0.4 V) LEEFT has no obvious effect on the following ozonation, but a higher-voltage (0.6-1.2 V) LEEFT significantly enhances the ozone inactivation. After the LEEFT, a large number of viable cells with impaired cell membranes are observed, shown by both selective plate count and staining methods. The mechanism inducing the enhancement is explained by the initially reparable pores generated by LEEFT that cannot recover in the subsequent ozonation and the greater intracellular diffusion of ozone after the membrane disruption induced by LEEFT. The application of LEEFT as a pretreatment process is beneficial to reduce the ozone dosage and disinfection by-product formation with a broader inactivation spectrum, which facilitates the application of ozonation in primary water disinfection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4167-9887"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jianfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4658-7789"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2253-0964"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Xing", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32940462", "10.1021/acs.est.0c03968"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
