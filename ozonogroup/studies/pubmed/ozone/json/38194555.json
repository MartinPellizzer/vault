In this Letter, it is pretty novel to enhance the photocurrent and responsivity of self-driven UV photodetectors by (Al,Ga)N nanowire/graphene/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) heterojunction successfully. Compared to those of the photodetector with only nanowire/graphene heterojunction, it is found that both the photocurrent and responsivity of the photodetector with nanowire/graphene/PVDF heterojunction can be enhanced more than 100%. It is proposed that PVDF could maintain the internal gain by increasing the number of carrier cycles. Furthermore, this photodetector can also have a high detectivity of 5.3\u00d710<sup>11</sup> Jones and fast response speed under 310 nm illumination. After preserving for one month without any special protection, both photocurrent and responsivity of the photodetector with nanowire/graphene/PVDF heterojunction are demonstrated to be quite stable. Therefore, this work paves an effective way to improve the performance of photodetectors for their applications in the fields of next-generation optoelectronic devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yukun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qianyi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Xiushuo", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jianya", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Shulong", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7708433", "ISSNLinking": "0146-9592"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38194555", "10.1364/OL.509752", "545382"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
