New plants were grown from rhizomes in six open-top field chambers. Three chambers received charcoal-filtered air, and three received charcoal-filtered air plus 80 ppb ozone, 8 h/day for 65 days. Flower, leaf, and shoot number per plant were recorded weekly. Photosynthetic rates were measured in week 5, and foliar injury was assessed during week 9. Final dry weight of roots, shoots, and rhizomes were determined. While ozone-treated plants from all states expressed symptoms of ozone injury, plants from South Carolina exhibited no effect of ozone on any other measured variable. Plants from the Georgia site showed ozone-induced reductions in all measured variables except leaf dry weight. Ozone-treated plants from New Jersey showed reductions in photosynthetic rate, leaf and shoot number, and root dry weights. Only plants from New Jersey produced flowers, with ozone treatment causing delay in flowering and reduction in the number of flower spikes produced."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Environmental Resources Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "Matthew D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sinn", "ForeName": "Judith P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Donald D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "Eva J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12442793", "10.1016/s0269-7491(02)00178-1", "S0269-7491(02)00178-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
