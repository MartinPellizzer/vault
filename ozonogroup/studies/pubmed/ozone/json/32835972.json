The performance of EC process can be improved significantly in combination with degradation processes. Different combinations of EC process with Fenton, electro-Fenton, photo-Fenton, photocatalysis, sonochemical treatment, ozonation, indirect electrochemical oxidation, anodic oxidation and sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process are found very effective for the treatment of water and wastewater. Enhanced performance of EC process in combination with degradation process was reported in most of the articles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
