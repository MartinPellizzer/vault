The emission concentrations and compositional characteristics of volatile organic compounds(VOCs) in different types of coatings were compared and studied. The ozone formation potential(OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential(SOAFP) of the different types of coatings were also analyzed. Solvent-based coatings has higher TVOC concentrations, OFPs, and SOAFPs than water-based, solvent-based UV, water-based UV, and powder coatings. The concentrations and composition of VOCs emitted from the different types of coatings were also different. The main VOC groups of the solvent-based and solvent-based UV coatings were aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds(OVOCs). Specifically, the proportions of aromatic hydrocarbons are 41.91%-60.67% and 42.51%-43.00%, respectively, and the proportions of OVOCs were 24.75%-41.29% and 41.34%-43.21%, respectively. OVOCs accounted for the highest proportion of VOCs in the water-based, water-based UV, and powder coatings, at 54.02%-62.10%, 55.23%-64.81%, and 42.98%-46.45%, respectively. The major VOC compound of the solvent-based coatings was styrene(14.68%), and the main component of the water-based coatings was methylal(14.61%). The main species of VOCs from the solvent-based UV and water-based UV coatings were butyl acetate(15.36% and 20.56%, respectively). The most abundant species from the powder coatings was ethyl 3-ethoxy propionate(20.19%). Aromatic hydrocarbons were the most important contributor to the OFP of the solvent-based and solvent-based UV coatings, accounting for 79.84% and 80.32%, respectively. Aromatic hydrocarbons(51.48% and 36.71%) and OVOCs(42.30% and 41.03%) were the major contributors to the OFP of the water-based and water-based UV coatings, respectively. Aromatic hydrocarbons(43.46%), OVOCs(28.06%), and olefins(25.24%) were the main factors affecting the OFP of the powder coatings. Aromatic hydrocarbons dominate the SOAFP of solvent-based, water-based, solvent-based UV, water-based UV, and powder coatings, accounting for more than 99%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Chun-Ling", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui-Yuan", "Initials": "RY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Yi-Juan", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yin-Song", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Mo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control Technology and Equipment, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Li-Ya", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control Technology and Equipment, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Dai-Qi", "Initials": "DQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interior Design and Furnishings"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581106", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202101235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
