Biofiltration degradation kinetics of an aldehyde mixture containing hexanal, 2-methylbutanal (2-MB), and 3-methylbutanal (3-MB) was investigated using a bench-scale, synthetic, media-based biofilter. The adsorption capacity of the synthetic media for a model VOC, 3-methylbutanal, was 10 times that of compost. Periodic residence time distribution analysis (over the course of 1 yr) via a tracer study (84-99% recovery), indicated plug flow without channeling in the synthetic media and lack of compaction in the reactor. Simple first-order and zero-order kinetic models both equally fit the experimental data, yet analysis of the measured rate constants versus fractional conversion suggested an overall first-order model was more appropriate. Kinetic analysis indicated that hexanal had a significantly higher reaction rate (k = 0.09 +/- 0.005 1/sec; 23 +/- 1.3 ppmv) compared with the branched aldehydes (k = 0.04 +/- 0.0036 1/sec; 31 +/- 1.6 ppmv for 2-MB and 0.03 +/- 0.0051 1/sec; 22 +/- 1.3 ppmv for 3-MB). After 3 months of operation, all three compounds reached 100% removal (50 sec residence time, 18-46 ppmv inlet). Media samples withdrawn from the biofilter and observed under scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated microbial growth, suggesting removal of the aldehydes could be attributed to biodegradation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kolar", "ForeName": "Praveen", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kastner", "ForeName": "James R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herner", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18376644", "10.3155/1047-3289.58.3.412"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
