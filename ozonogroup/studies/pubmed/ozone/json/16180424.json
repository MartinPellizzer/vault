Combinations of pre- and/or post-ozonation with UASB treatment gave better results than ozonation or UASB alone and COD reductions of 53.0-98.9% were achieved for treatment of canning and winery wastewaters. A UASB reactor was fed with pre-ozonated cannery wastewater for over 70 d. COD removal improved from between 58.8 and 64.4% to between 85.3 and 91.8% after pre-ozonated substrate feed commenced. Subsequent increases in organic loading rate (OLR) from 2.4 to 3.4 kgCOD m(-3) x d(-1) did not affect reactor performance. By including a final post-ozonation treatment to this UASB effluent a total COD reduction of 99.2% was achieved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Stellenbosch, Private Bag Xl, Matieland, 7602, South Africa. gos@sun.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sigge", "ForeName": "G O", "Initials": "GO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Britz", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fourie", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnardt", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Anaerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prunus"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16180424"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
