In order to understand the meteorological formation mechanisms of ozone pollution in Guangdong Province in winter, the moderate ozone pollution process in Guangdong Province from January 3-6, 2022 was selected for comparison with that in autumn (high pollution season) of 2015 to 2021. The research was based on ground and vertical sounding data and reanalysis data of air quality and meteorological elements. Eight cities exceeded the standard during the pollution process, among which Zhaoqing showed moderate pollution (219 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) on January 4<sup>th</sup>. The average O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration in Guangdong Province was 123 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, which was 21% higher than that in historical autumn. However, its scope of pollution was less than the historical pollution processes in autumn. Lower wind speed, longer sunshine hours, and airflow reflux effect under local circulation were the most important ground-level meteorological conditions for the ozone pollution process, whereas lower temperature might be an important reason for its small scope of pollution. Vertical detection analysis showed that the combined effect of low-level temperature inversion layer, stronger downdraft, and lower wind speed kept the NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at a high level, and further induced a higher increment of ozone concentration in the morning (34.2 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> higher than that in the non-pollution period). The downward transport of ozone in the residual layer aggravated the ozone pollution on January 4<sup>th</sup>. The accumulation of ozone and its precursors was an important factor of the aggravation of ozone pollution the following day. Airflow trajectory analysis revealed that the ground-level ozone was affected by horizontal transport and vertical mixing of pollutants. Potential sources at 10 m were mainly distributed in the coastal areas from Fujian to Guangdong, and the scope of potential sources was concentrated in Guangdong as the height increased. Airflow backward trajectories at different heights during the ozone process passed over the areas of potential sources in Guangdong, which indicated that the local emissions in Guangdong had a greater impact on the ozone pollution process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Ecological Meteorological Center, Pearl River Delta Center for Environmental Meteorology Prediction and Warning, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ting-Yuan", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Ecological Meteorological Center, Pearl River Delta Center for Environmental Meteorology Prediction and Warning, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jing-Yang", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Ecological Meteorological Center, Pearl River Delta Center for Environmental Meteorology Prediction and Warning, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Air Quality Monitoring, Guangdong Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Secondary Air Pollution Research, Guangdong Ecological Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37438269", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202206097"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
