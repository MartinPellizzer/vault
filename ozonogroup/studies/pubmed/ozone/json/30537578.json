We focus on the difference between mass-based leaf N concentration (N<sub>mass</sub>) and area-based one (N<sub>area</sub>) in their responses to elevated O<sub>3</sub>, and the allocation of N to different leaf components: photosynthetic apparatus, cell walls, and others under elevated O<sub>3</sub> level. Our results showed that elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased N<sub>mass</sub>, but reduced N<sub>area</sub> and leaf mass per area (LMA). The two clones showed no difference in N<sub>mass</sub> response to O<sub>3</sub>, but the more sensitive clone showed greater reduction of N<sub>area</sub> and LMA due to O<sub>3</sub>. We also found positive relationships between N<sub>area</sub> and photosynthetic parameters, e.g. light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A<sub>sat</sub>). Furthermore, elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly reduced photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE) and leaf N allocation to photosynthetic components, while increasing N allocation to cell walls and other components. We concluded that plants invested more N in cell walls and other components to resist O<sub>3</sub> damages at the expense of photosynthetic N. The change of N allocation in plant leaves in response to elevated O<sub>3</sub> could have an impact on ecological processes, e.g. leaf litter decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
