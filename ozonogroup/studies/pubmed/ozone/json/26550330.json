It leads to toxicity with its oxidative injury. The purpose of our study is investigating the medical ozone preconditioning and treatment has any effect on the methotrexate-induced kidneys by activating antioxidant enzymes in rats. Eighteen rats were divided into three equal groups; control, Mtx without and with medical ozone. Nephrotoxicity was performed with a single dose of 20 mg/kg Mtx intraperitoneally at the fifteenth day of experiment on groups 2 and 3. Medical ozone preconditioning was performed at a dose of 25 mcg/ml (5 ml) intraperitoneally everyday in the group 3 and treated with medical ozone for five more days while group 2 was received only 5 ml of saline everyday for twenty days. All rats were sacrificed at the end of third week and the blood and kidney tissue samples were obtained to measure the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, malondialdehyde, glutathione and myeloperoxidase. Kidney injury score was evaluated histolopatologically. Medical ozone preconditioning and treatment ameliorated the biochemical parameters and kidney injury induced by Mtx. There was significant increase in tissue MDA, MPO activity, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (P<0.05) and significant decrease in tissue GSH and histopathology (P<0.05) after Mtx administration. The preconditioning and treatment with medical ozone ameliorated the nephrotoxicity induced by Mtx in rats by activating antioxidant enzymes and prevented renal tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Antalya Education and Research Hospital Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aslaner", "ForeName": "Arif", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Antalya Education and Research Hospital Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7ak\u0131r", "ForeName": "Tu\u011frul", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Antalya Education and Research Hospital Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7elik", "ForeName": "Bet\u00fcl", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Antalya Education and Research Hospital Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Do\u011fan", "ForeName": "U\u011fur", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Antalya Education and Research Hospital Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Mayir", "ForeName": "Burhan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterologic Surgery, Haydarpa\u015fa Training and Research Hospital Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aky\u00fcz", "ForeName": "Cebrail", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Public Health Laboratuary K\u00fctahya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Polat", "ForeName": "Cemal", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Akdeniz University Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ba\u015ft\u00fcrk", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Inon\u00fc University Faculty of Medicine Malatya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Soyer", "ForeName": "Vural", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Surgery, Inon\u00fc University Faculty of Medicine Malatya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ko\u00e7", "ForeName": "S\u00fcleyman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Marmara University Istanbul, Turkey ; Near East University Faculty of Denstry Nicosia, North Cyprus."}], "LastName": "\u015eehirli", "ForeName": "Ahmet \u00d6zer", "Initials": "A\u00d6"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Clin Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101471010", "ISSNLinking": "1940-5901"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bleyer WA.
