Karst.) and fir seedlings (Abies alba Mill.) which had been exposed to low levels of ozone, sulfur dioxide and simulated rain or a combination of all three variables in open top chambers from 1983 through 1988. The gas exchange measurements were carried out in March 1988 at the end of the five year experiment. The twigs examined did not exhibit any visible sign of injury, specifically no differences were apparent between trees under the treatments of simulated acidic rain at pH 5.0 and pH 4.0. The study of carbon dioxide response curves showed different effects of the pollutants on the tree species. One-Year-old spruce needles treated with O(3) and simulated acidic precipitation pH 4.0 showed noticeable reduction of net photosynthetic rate. Exposure to the combination O(3) and SO(2) at pH 4.0 resulted in a significant depression of photosynthesis in two-year-old needles Transpiration rate was not decreased to a similar extent. No changes either in photosynthesis or transpiration were found in spruce under fumigation with SO(2) alone. These results indicate that ozone is the principal cause of changes in photosynthetic performance of spruce. It alters mesophyll response rather than reducing stomatal conductance. The specific changes that occur in the mesophyll could be diagnosed as inactivation of a carbon fixing enzyme as well as damage of the electron transport system. Fir seem to be more tolerant to ozone. No changes in photosynthesis and transpiration following exposure to O(3) alone were found. However, SO(2) fumigation, alone or in combination with O(3), resulted in a marked decrease of photosynthetic performance. Particularly, carboxylation efficiency and also maximum carboxylation velocity were depressed indicating a reduction in carbon fixing enzyme activity. No differences between single and combined fumigation treatments regarding these variables were determined. However, parameters measured to determine changes in electron transport rate showed a higher depression in the presence of both pollutants. Transpiration also was reduced by SO(2)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Landeskultur und Pflanzen\u00f6kologie, Fachgebiet Pflanzen\u00f6kologie, Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim Postfach 700562 D-7000 Stuttgart 70, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schweizer", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arndt", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092177", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90031-7", "0269749190900317"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
