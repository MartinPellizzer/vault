Fumigation of the plants with ozone (0.5 microliter per liter) caused a redistribution of (14)C among lipid classes, i.e. a marked increase of (14)C content in triacylglycerol (TG) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DG) and a decrease of label in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) without affecting (14)C distribution in leaf fatty acids. Label in both TG and 1,2-DG was found predominantly in their polyene molecular species. Since MGDG consists of similar polyene molecular species, the results indicate the synthesis of TG from MGDG via 1,2-DG. Label was also accumulated in tri- and tetragalactosyldiacylglycerol, products of galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase (GGGT). Moreover, there was a close relation between increases in the amounts of TG and the oligogalactolipids in ozonetreated leaves. These results indicate that MGDG was converted to 1,2-DG by GGGT and then to TG. In intact chloroplasts isolated from ozone-treated leaves, there was an enhanced production of free fatty acid (FFA), which was diminished by the addition of coenzyme A (CoA) and ATP, indicating that ozone stimulated the hydrolysis of MGDG to liberate FFA, which was in turn converted to acyl-CoA. The final step of TG synthesis, acylation of 1,2-DG with acyl-CoA, was confirmed by feeding with [1-(14)C]linolenic acid in leaf discs excised from ozone-fumigated leaves; (14)C was effectively incorporated into TG but not into 1,2-DG. These results demonstrate the synthesis of TG from 1,2-DG and FFA which were liberated from MGDG in ozone-fumigated spinach leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Biology, The National Institute for Environmental Studies, Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakaki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1976 Mar 12;423(3):540-7", "ArticleIdList": ["1259958"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1980 Oct;66(4):666-71", "ArticleIdList": ["16661499"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1973 Apr 27;305(1):153-62", "ArticleIdList": ["4719597"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1969 Sep 16;189(1):95-105", "ArticleIdList": ["4390405"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1987 Dec;259(2):481-96", "ArticleIdList": ["3426240"]}, {"Citation": "Atmos Environ. 1969 Nov;3(6):669-82", "ArticleIdList": ["5382204"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1965 Jul;40(4):725-35", "ArticleIdList": ["5827648"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1980 Apr 15;188(1):17-24", "ArticleIdList": ["7406878"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1978 Apr 28;529(1):44-53", "ArticleIdList": ["638180"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Oct;94(2):781-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16667779"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1974 May;53(5):699-704", "ArticleIdList": ["16658772"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1969 Nov;44(11):1523-7", "ArticleIdList": ["5397496"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1949 Jan;24(1):1-15", "ArticleIdList": ["16654194"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Feb;67(2):250-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16661656"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1967 Oct 2;144(2):470-2", "ArticleIdList": ["6064621"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Oct;94(2):766-72", "ArticleIdList": ["16667777"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1980 Aug;203(1):296-306", "ArticleIdList": ["7406501"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1975 Nov;152(2):217-28", "ArticleIdList": ["1220682"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Jul;87(3):638-46", "ArticleIdList": ["16666199"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1964 Sep;3:1280-7", "ArticleIdList": ["14231719"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16667778", "PMC1077298", "10.1104/pp.94.2.773"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
