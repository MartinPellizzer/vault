We show that porous ZnO coatings with the thickness in the range between 140 and 420 nm can be obtained using only five cycles of SIS. The pores in ZnO fabricated via swelling-assisted SIS are highly accessible, and up to 98% of pores are available for solvent penetration. The XPS data indicate that the surface of nanoporous ZnO films is terminated with -OH groups. Density functional theory calculations show a lower energy barrier for ethanol-induced release of the oxygen restricted depletion layer in the case of the presence of -OH groups at the ZnO surface, and hence, it can lead to higher sensitivity in sensing of ethanol. We monitored the response of ZnO porous coatings with different thicknesses and porosities to ethanol vapors using combined mass-based and chemiresistive approaches at room temperature and 90 \u00b0C. The porous ZnO conformal coatings reveal a promising sensitivity toward detection of ethanol at low temperatures. Our results suggest the excellent potential of the SIS approach for the design of conformal ZnO coatings with controlled porosity, thickness, and composition that can be adapted for sensing applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Engineering Department and Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Processes Institute, University of North Texas, 1155 Union Circle, Denton, Texas 76203, United States."}], "LastName": "Pleshek", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Engineering Department and Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Processes Institute, University of North Texas, 1155 Union Circle, Denton, Texas 76203, United States."}], "LastName": "Tran", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Engineering Department and Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Processes Institute, University of North Texas, 1155 Union Circle, Denton, Texas 76203, United States."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuzhe", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Engineering Department and Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Processes Institute, University of North Texas, 1155 Union Circle, Denton, Texas 76203, United States."}], "LastName": "Shirani", "ForeName": "Asghar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5565-2060"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Nanoscale Materials, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S.
