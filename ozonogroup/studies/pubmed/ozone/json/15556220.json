Cell-free extracts of Anabaena circinalis were added to raw, untreated drinking water obtained from a water supply reservoir to provide a toxicity of 30 microg (STX equivalents)l(-1). Ozone alone, or in combination with H(2)O(2), failed to destroy the highly toxic STX and GTX-2/3, and only partially destroyed dc-STX, and the low-toxicity C-toxins and GTX-5. In all cases, the toxicity of the water was reduced by less than 10%. GAC removed all of the STX, dc-STX and GTXs, but only partially removed the C-toxins. However, the residual toxicity was reduced to the suggested Australian drinking water guideline concentration of 3 microg (STX equivalents)l(-1) without O(3) pre-treatment. Modelling the spontaneous chemical degradation of residual C-toxins following treatment shows that residual toxicity could increase to 10 microgl(-1) after 11 d due to formation of dc-GTXs and would then gradually decay. In all, residual toxicity would exceed the Australian drinking water guideline concentration for a total of 50 d."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Land and Water, Brisbane Laboratory, 120 Meiers Rd, Indooroopilly Qld 4068, Australia. philip.orr@bigfoot.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orr", "ForeName": "Philip T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Gary J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamilton", "ForeName": "Geoffrey R", "Initials": "GR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "35523-89-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Saxitoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anabaena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guideline Adherence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Saxitoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15556220", "10.1016/j.watres.2004.08.024", "S0043-1354(04)00421-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
