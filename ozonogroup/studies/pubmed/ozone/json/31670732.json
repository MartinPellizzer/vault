The uptake of three organic nitrates into semi-solid SOA particles formed by \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis either with or without an OH scavenger was investigated. Four types of experiments are presented here. In Series A, uptake of the selected organic nitrates (2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2EHN); \u03b2-hydroxypropyl nitrate (HPN); \u03b2-hydroxyhexyl nitrate (HHN)) into impacted SOA particles was interrogated by attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR. In this case, equilibrium was reached and partition coefficients (K<sub>SOA</sub> = [-ONO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SOA</sub>/[-ONO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>air</sub>) were measured to be K<sup>2EHN</sup> = (3.2-11) \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>, K<sup>HPN</sup> = (4.4-5.4) \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>, and K<sup>HHN</sup> = (4.9-9.0) \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>. In Series B, SOA particles were exposed on-the-fly to gas phase organic nitrates for comparison to Series A, and uptake of organic nitrates was quantified by HR-ToF-AMS analysis, which yielded similar results. In Series C (AMS) and D (ATR-FTIR), each organic nitrate was incorporated into the SOA as the particles formed and grew. The incorporation of the RONO<sub>2</sub> was much larger in Series C and D (during growth), exceeding equilibrium values determined in Series A and B (after growth). This suggests that enhanced uptake of organic nitrates during SOA formation and growth is due to a kinetically controlled \"burying\" mechanism, rather than equilibrium partitioning. This has important implications for understanding SOA formation and growth under conditions where the particles are semi-solid, which is central to accurately predicting properties for such SOA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-2025, USA. bjfinlay@uci.edu."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9925-7794"], "LastName": "Vander Wall", "ForeName": "Allison C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-2025, USA. bjfinlay@uci.edu."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1247-9787"], "LastName": "Perraud", "ForeName": "V\u00e9ronique", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-2025, USA. bjfinlay@uci.edu."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5847-9913"], "LastName": "Wingen", "ForeName": "Lisa M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-2025, USA. bjfinlay@uci.edu."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4650-168X"], "LastName": "Finlayson-Pitts", "ForeName": "Barbara J", "Initials": "BJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31670732", "10.1039/c9em00379g"]}}]}
