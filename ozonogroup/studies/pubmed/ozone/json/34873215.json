Using data from a prospective cohort study conducted on pregnant women (n\u2009=\u20092153), we explored the association between air pollution and perceived stress, which was assessed using the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), among pregnant women. Average exposures to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of\u2009<\u20092.5\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) or\u2009<\u200910\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) for each trimester and the entire pregnancy were estimated at maternal residential addresses using land-use regression models. Linear regression models were applied to estimate associations between PSS scores and exposures to each air pollutant. After adjustment for potential confounders, interquartile-range (IQR) increases in whole pregnancy exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> in the third trimester were associated with 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01, 0.74), 0.54 (95% CI 0.11, 0.97), and 0.30 (95% CI 0.07, 0.54) point increases in prenatal PSS scores, respectively. Furthermore, these associations were more evident in women with child-bearing age and a lower level of education. Also, the association between PSS scores and PM<sub>10</sub> was stronger in the spring. Our findings support the relationship between air pollution and prenatal maternal stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
