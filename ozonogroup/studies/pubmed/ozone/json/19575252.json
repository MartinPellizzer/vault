As a result, a substantial rise has taken place in the types and number of emission sources of various air pollutants. However, due to the lack of air quality management capabilities, the country is suffering from deterioration of air quality. Evidence from various governmental organizations and international bodies has indicated that air pollution is a significant risk to the environment, quality of life, and health of the population. The Government has taken positive steps toward air quality management in the form of the Pakistan Clean Air Program and has recently established a small number of continuous monitoring stations. However, ambient air quality standards have not yet been established. This paper reviews the data being available on the criteria air pollutants: particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead.", "Air pollution studies in Pakistan published in both scientific journals and by the Government have been reviewed and the reported concentrations of PM, SO(2), O(3), CO, NO(2), and Pb collated. A comparison of the levels of these air pollutants with the World Health Organization air quality guidelines was carried out.", "Particulate matter was the most serious air pollutant in the country. NO(2) has emerged as the second high-risk pollutant. The reported levels of PM, SO(2), CO, NO(2), and Pb were many times higher than the World Health Organization air quality guidelines. Only O(3) concentrations were below the guidelines.", "The current state of air quality calls for immediate action to tackle the poor air quality. The establishment of ambient air quality standards, an extension of the continuous monitoring sites, and the development of emission control strategies are essential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, CO4 3SQ, UK. colbi@essex.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colbeck", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nasir", "ForeName": "Zaheer Ahmad", "Initials": "ZA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Zulfiqar", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}], "NumberOfReferences": "103"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Public Health. 2006 Feb;120(2):132-41", "ArticleIdList": ["16263146"]}, {"Citation": "Educ Health (Abingdon). 2003 Jul;16(2):230", "ArticleIdList": ["14741909"]}, {"Citation": "Public Health. 2008 Jul;122(7):708-15", "ArticleIdList": ["18359052"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2006 Apr 1;358(1-3):36-45", "ArticleIdList": ["16165193"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2002 Mar;74(3):255-62", "ArticleIdList": ["11944798"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 1994 Aug;32(1):37-45", "ArticleIdList": ["24214006"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2004 Feb;70(2):95-100", "ArticleIdList": ["15160735"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2007 Aug 25;147(3):759-67", "ArticleIdList": ["17320287"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2007 Apr;127(1-3):237-52", "ArticleIdList": ["17058006"]}, {"Citation": "Bull World Health Organ. 2003;81(6):468", "ArticleIdList": ["12894337"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2004 Oct;54(10):1321-38", "ArticleIdList": ["15540584"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2008 Jan;136(1-3):219-26", "ArticleIdList": ["17385053"]}, {"Citation": "Ann Chim. 2004 Nov;94(11):805-15", "ArticleIdList": ["15626241"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2006 Jan;78(2):128-37", "ArticleIdList": ["16120474"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2007 Dec;135(1-3):459-64", "ArticleIdList": ["17380418"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2008 Oct 1;404(1):103-12", "ArticleIdList": ["18667227"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2008 Feb;137(1-3):25-33", "ArticleIdList": ["17447150"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2006 Mar;114(1-3):573-87", "ArticleIdList": ["16583145"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2008 Jan;136(1-3):257-65", "ArticleIdList": ["17385052"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2007 Aug 1;381(1-3):47-58", "ArticleIdList": ["17481696"]}, {"Citation": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol. 2005 Oct;75(4):739-46", "ArticleIdList": ["16400555"]}, {"Citation": "East Mediterr Health J. 2006 Nov;12(6):886-93", "ArticleIdList": ["17333836"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19575252", "10.1007/s11356-009-0217-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
