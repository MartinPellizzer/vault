The results showed that the synoptic situations in the pollution situation that O\u2083 reached middle level pollution and PM\u2082.\u2085 maintained low concentrations (O\u2083high-PM\u2082.\u2085 low) could be characterized as northwest gas flow in 500 hPa height and high-pressure rear in the ground. Whereas the synoptic situations in the pollution situation that O\u2083 and PM\u2082.\u2085 both reached middle level pollution (O\u2083-PM\u2082.\u2085 high) could be characterized as westerly gas flow in 500 hPa height and low pressure in the ground. Compared with the O\u2083high-PM\u2082.\u2085 low situation, meteorological elements in O\u2083-PM\u2082.\u2085 high situation could be characterized as stronger southerly winds and higher relative humidity. In the O\u2083-PM\u2082.\u2085 high situation, initial concentrations of O\u2083 and PM\u2082.\u2085 were higher and diurnal variations of PM\u2082.\u2085 were more significant, nevertheless, the average concentrations of O\u2083 were lower than those in the O\u2083high-PM\u2082.\u2085 low situation, respectively. The analysis of precursors, atmospheric oxidation and chemical compositions of PM\u2082.\u2085 showed that the accumulation and hygroscopic growth of PM\u2082.\u2085 under unfavorable meteorological conditions as well as the regional transport caused by strong southerly winds might be the main factors leading to high PM\u2082.\u2085 concentrations in O\u2083-PM\u2082.\u2085 high situation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhan-shan", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Da-wei", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun-ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Rui-wen", "Initials": "RW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Nai-di", "Initials": "ND"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27337870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
