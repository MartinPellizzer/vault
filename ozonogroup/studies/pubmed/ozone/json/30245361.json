Although its pathogenesis remains unclear, limited evidence exists on the role of air pollution.", "We aimed to assess the association of short-term air pollution exposure with migraine in conjunction with the synergistic effect of temperature.", "We identified 18,921 patients who visited emergency departments (EDs) for migraine as a primary disease in Seoul from the national emergency database between 2008 and 2014. We conducted a time-stratified, case-crossover analysis to compare levels of particles <2.5\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particles <10\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) on ED visit days and those on the control days matched to day of the week, month, and year. We evaluated the synergistic effects of air pollution and temperature using an interaction term.", "Higher air pollution levels were significantly associated with risk of migraine over various lag structures.
