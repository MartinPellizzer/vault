Consumers were not advised of the contamination nor products withdrawn. From 1981, the industry also resisted calls to declare fully the extent of use and long term safety data on all additives used in their products. They developed standard public responses that were evasive and misleading and, in 2000, implemented voluntary additive disclosure which allowed the companies to continue to avoid disclosure of any ingredient they deemed to be a trade secret. There was extensive use of ozone depleting freon in Australian tobacco manufacturing. Again, the industry kept this information away from consumers.", "Australian smokers are unable to make informed decisions about smoking because pesticide and additive disclosure remains voluntary. The Australian government should regulate tobacco to require full disclosure including information on the likely health consequences of inhaling pesticide and additive pyrolysis products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "VicHealth Centre for Tobacco Control. simonchapman@health.usyd.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chapman", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 CA87110-01A1", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Tob Control", "NlmUniqueID": "9209612", "ISSNLinking": "0964-4563"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutic Aids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organizational Policy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutic Aids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Truth Disclosure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Tob Control. 2000 Sep;9(3):283-91", "ArticleIdList": ["10982572"]}, {"Citation": "Tob Control. 2003 Mar;12(1):107-8", "ArticleIdList": ["12612376"]}, {"Citation": "Med J Aust. 1973 Aug 11;2(6):261-4", "ArticleIdList": ["4126678"]}, {"Citation": "Food Cosmet Toxicol. 1981 Aug;19(4):437-42", "ArticleIdList": ["6792018"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 1976 Sep;6(2):161-3", "ArticleIdList": ["989182"]}, {"Citation": "Acta Paediatr Scand. 1977 Nov;66(6):761-5", "ArticleIdList": ["411325"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1975 Jan-Feb;23(1):64-71", "ArticleIdList": ["1133280"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14645948", "PMC1766126", "10.1136/tc.12.suppl_3.iii45"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
