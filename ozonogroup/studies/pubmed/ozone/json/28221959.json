The objective of this study was to assess the possibility of expanding the application of ozone for oxidative degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The evaluation was conducted by ozonation of a benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) standard solution and smoked fish (sprats) contaminated with PAHs. The effect of ozonation was immediate in the BaP solution; 89% of this toxic compound was decomposed after only 1 min of treatment. However, the impact of ozonation on the smoked sprats was less pronounced, even after prolonged treatment. The final reduction in benzo[b]fluoranthene and BaP concentrations in smoked sprats contaminated with PAHs was 34 and 46%, respectively, after 60 min of ozonation, but no significant decrease of benzo[a]anthracene and chrysene concentrations was observed. To evaluate the safety of ozonation, the toxicity of the ozone-treated BaP standard solution was investigated. In vitro toxicity was evaluated using human hepatocellular carcinoma and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines as models. The cytotoxicity of the BaP standard solution significantly increased after ozonation, indicating a pronounced negative effect in terms of food safety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health and Environment \"BIOR\", Lejupes iela 3, Riga LV-1076, Latvia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Latvia, Jelgavas iela 1, Riga LV-1004, Latvia."}], "LastName": "Rozentale", "ForeName": "Irina", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Latvia, Jelgavas iela 1, Riga LV-1004, Latvia."}], "LastName": "Ancans", "ForeName": "Janis", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Safety, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Tilzes g. 18, Kaunas 47181, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Bartkiene", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Latvia, Jelgavas iela 1, Riga LV-1004, Latvia."}], "LastName": "Viksna", "ForeName": "Arturs", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health and Environment \"BIOR\", Lejupes iela 3, Riga LV-1076, Latvia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Latvia, Jelgavas iela 1, Riga LV-1004, Latvia."}], "LastName": "Bartkevics", "ForeName": "Vadims", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FJO154KG1X", "NameOfSubstance": "benzo(b)fluoranthene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fishes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28221959", "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-133", "S0362-028X(22)09347-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
