The TCE and 2,4-DCP decomposition by ozonation in organic solvents followed to the first-order reaction kinetics with respect to TCE or 2,4-DCP concentration. The orders of the rate constants among organic solvents for undissociative TCE and dissociative 2,4-DCP were different indicating that the ozonation rates for undissociative and dissociative compounds were dependent on the chemical property of organic solvent. The decomposition of undissociative TCE by ozonation was a simple electrophilic reaction, which was dependent on acceptor number (AN) of the solvent. On the other hand, the decomposition of dissociative 2,4-DCP was dependent on by the dissociation of the compounds and would be dependent on donor number (DN) of the solvent. Finally, TCE in acetic acid was transformed to chlorinated intermediates and chloride ion and then these intermediates were continuously oxidized to chlorine gas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, 1-4-1 Kagamiyama, 739-8527 Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Tsung-Yueh", "Initials": "TY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okawa", "ForeName": "Kiyokazu", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakano", "ForeName": "Yoichi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishijima", "ForeName": "Wataru", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okada", "ForeName": "Mitsumasa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "290YE8AR51", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichloroethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R669TG1950", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-dichlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trichloroethylene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15504474", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.08.081", "S0045-6535(04)00735-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
