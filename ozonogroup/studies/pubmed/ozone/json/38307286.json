Utilising speciated VOC data from large petrochemical refineries, the research assesses the photochemical loss of various VOC species. Air samples from multiple sites revealed over 99 VOCs, with initial concentrations estimated via a photochemical age-based parameterisation method. The comparative analysis of initial and measured VOC values provided insights into the VOCs' photochemical degradation during transport. Findings highlight that the average photochemical loss of total VOCs (TVOCs) across different refinery process areas varied between 4.9 and 506.8\u00a0ppb, averaging 187.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0128.7\u00a0ppb. Alkenes dominated the consumed VOCs at 83.1\u00a0%, followed by aromatic hydrocarbons (9.3\u00a0%), alkanes (6.1\u00a0%), and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) at 1.6\u00a0%. The average consumption-based ozone formation potential (OFP) and SOA formation potential (SOAP) were calculated at 1767.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01251.1\u00a0ppb and 2959.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02386.3\u00a0ppb, respectively. Alkenes, primarily isoprene, 1,3-butadiene, and acetylene, were the most significant contributors to OFP, ranging from 19.9\u00a0% to 95.5\u00a0%. Aromatic hydrocarbons, predominantly monocyclic aromatics like toluene, xylene, styrene, and n-dodecane, were the primary contributors to SOAP, accounting for 5.0\u00a0% to 81.3\u00a0%. This research underscores the significance of considering photochemical losses in VOCs for accurate secondary pollution assessment, particularly in high-reactivity VOC species. It also provides new detection methods and accurate data for the characterization, source analysis and chemical conversion of volatile organic compounds in the petroleum refining industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
