Chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs) are the primary causes of ozone layer depletion, and together with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), they contribute to global climate warming. PFAS are emerging persistent organic pollutants, comprising thousands of materials including perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), perfluoroalkane sulfonamides (FASAs), and fluoropolymers.As the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and the Stockholm Convention makes progress, fluorochemical industry is searching for alternatives like HFCs, perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) and etc. Even though studies on chemical processes and environmental influences of the fluorochemical industry are plentiful, research on emissions of fluorine chemicals from different fluorochemical industry is still scarce. In this study, we conducted on-site sampling to analyze the distribution of fluorine chemicals in the surrounding environment of the fluorochemical industrial sites. The sampling sites represent different stages of fluorochemical industry production, including fluorite mining, synthesis of fluorochemical raw materials like fluorocarbons, and fine fluorine product processing which is mostly PFAS. Results show that at the fluorite mining stage, concurrent emissions of fluoride ion and CFC-12 contribute to the primary environmental issue. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and some short-chain PFASs like perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) are the main pollutants from fluocarbons production, accompanied by emissions of fluorinated GHGs such as HFC-32, and HCFC-22. At the fine fluorine product synthesis stage where produces fluoropolymers, perfluoropolyethers and fluorinated surfactants, PFAS especially for emerging alternatives PFECAs like hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPODA) and Perfluoro-4-oxapentanoic acid (PF4OPeA), as well as fluorinated GHGs like HFC-23 and HFC-227ea, require increasing attention."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
