Recent studies have begun to unveil the complex nature of how these gases modulate the expression of plant signaling hormones, the defensive chemistries produced, and the responses of the myriad trophic interactions involving plant pathogens as well as insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Given the ubiquity of complex trophic interactions in both natural and managed systems, it is crucial that we understand how CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> interact with defense signaling hormones of plants and their consequences for their trophic associates if we are to adapt to, and even mitigate, the effects of climate change."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.
