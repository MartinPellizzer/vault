In a previous report, 4 ppm of ozonated water removed artificially contaminated bacteria from the hands of healthy volunteers as effectively as antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial soap and water. Currently, there is a lack of data on the efficacy of ozonated water in removing bacteria from hands loaded with organic materials. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ozonated water in removing bacteria from hands contaminated with organic material, according to the American Society for Testing and Materials E2946-13. Sixteen healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to the ozonated water group and the antimicrobial soap and water group. Their hands were contaminated with an avirulent strain of Escherichia coli in beef broth suspension. Approximately 3-log CFU bacterial reductions between baseline and postwash colonies were observed on the hands in both groups. Ozonated water may remove bacteria from hands contaminated with organic material with similar effectiveness as antimicrobial soap and water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9, International Association for Food Protection."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Kiwamu", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hara", "ForeName": "Yasuka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Harada", "ForeName": "Rie", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tanno", "ForeName": "Daiki", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kashiwazaki", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kobari", "ForeName": "Shuko", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kitabatake", "ForeName": "Mitsuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yui", "ForeName": "Suguru", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Microbiological Laboratory, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ohashi", "ForeName": "Kazutaka", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hidaka", "ForeName": "Tomoo", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Arai", "ForeName": "Kazuaki", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infection Control, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kanemitsu", "ForeName": "Keiji", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soaps"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hand Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soaps"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34233357", "10.4315/JFP-21-148", "S0362-028X(22)05716-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
