In Group 1 root canal enlargement up to ISO-size 60 (MAF) was performed, whereas only initial shaping (MAF ISO-size 40) was carried out in Groups 2 to 4. After sterilization all teeth were inoculated with E. faecalis and incubated for 3 days, followed by evaluation of CFU. Subsequently, root canal enlargement up to ISO-size 60 was performed in Groups 2 to 4 using NaCl solution (0.9%) in Group 2, NaOCl (1%) in Group 3 and CHX (0.2%) in Group 4. Finally, each group of 45 teeth was subdivided into three groups (n= 15 each) either applying Ca(OH)2 for 7 days, using Er:YAG laser radiation for 30 seconds or gaseous ozone for 120 seconds, followed by final evaluation of CFU.", "Both in Groups 1 and 2 the median reduction of bacteria after application of Ca(OH)2 (factor 10(4) each) and ozone (in Group 1: factor 5 x 10(3); in Group 2: factor 5 x 10(4)), respectively, was significantly higher than after Er:YAG laser treatment (factor 102 each, Mann-Whitney test). The antibacterial efficacy was significantly increased by the additional use of NaOCl or CHX as irrigants in all subgroups (Groups 3 and 4) compared to corresponding subgroups of Group 1 (Mann-Whitney test)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative Dentistry and Periodontology, University School of Dental Medicine, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Assmannshauser Str. 4-6, 14197 Berlin, Germany. joern.noetzel@charite.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Noetzel", "ForeName": "J\u00f6rn", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nonhoff", "ForeName": "J\u00f6rg", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bitter", "ForeName": "Kerstin", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "Jutta", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neumann", "ForeName": "Konrad", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kielbassa", "ForeName": "Andrej M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8806701", "ISSNLinking": "0894-8275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PF5DZW74VN", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Solid-State"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Preparation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19281107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
