In this study, effluent from a sequencing batch membrane bioreactor (SBMBR) was treated by O<sub>3</sub>-BAF at three specific ozone doses (0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC) and different empty bed contact times (EBCTs; 15-45 min). The reaction of O<sub>3</sub> with granular activated carbon (GAC) (O<sub>3</sub>/GAC) to promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) was evaluated at 1.0 mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC followed by BAF at 15-45 min EBCT. The efficacy of these techniques was compared for the removal of O<sub>3</sub> refractory 1,4-dioxane and the reduction in the formation of bromate, 35 regulated and unregulated halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs), and 8 N-nitrosamines after chloramination. Conventional ozonation (without the presence of GAC during ozonation) removed 6-11% of 1,4-dioxane, while BAF increased the removal to \u223c25%. O<sub>3</sub>/GAC improved the removal of 1,4-dioxane to \u223c40%, while BAF increased the removal to \u223c50%. No bromate was detected during conventional ozonation. Although O<sub>3</sub>/GAC formed 12.5 \u03bcg/L bromate, this concentration was reduced during BAF treatment to <6.8 \u03bcg/L. Even though conventional ozonation was more effective than O<sub>3</sub>/GAC for the reduction in chloramine-reactive N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors, BAF treatment after either conventional or enhanced ozonation reduced NDMA formation during chloramination to <10 ng/L. O<sub>3</sub>/GAC was more effective at reducing halogenated DBP formation during postchloramination. Regardless, the reduction in halogenated DBP formation during postchloramination achieved by BAF treatment was \u223c90% relative to the formation in the SBMBR effluent after either conventional or enhanced ozonation. The reduction of haloacetic acid (HAA) formation improved moderately with increasing BAF EBCT. Both O<sub>3</sub>-BAF and (O<sub>3</sub>/GAC)-BAF met regulatory levels for trihalomethanes, HAAs, NDMA, and bromate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Colorado School of Mines , 1500 Illinois Street , Golden , Colorado 80401 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vatankhah", "ForeName": "Hooman", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Stanford University , 473 Via Ortega , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szczuka", "ForeName": "Aleksandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Stanford University , 473 Via Ortega , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4917-0938"], "LastName": "Mitch", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Colorado School of Mines , 1500 Illinois Street , Golden , Colorado 80401 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Almaraz", "ForeName": "Nohemi", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Colorado School of Mines , 1500 Illinois Street , Golden , Colorado 80401 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brannum", "ForeName": "Jacob", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Colorado School of Mines , 1500 Illinois Street , Golden , Colorado 80401 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3366-3559"], "LastName": "Bellona", "ForeName": "Christopher", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J8A3S10O7S", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-dioxane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dioxanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30698962", "10.1021/acs.est.8b06897"]}}]}
