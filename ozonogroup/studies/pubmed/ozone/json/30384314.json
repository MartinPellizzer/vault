Trace organic compounds are not completely removed during conventional wastewater treatment. In order to prevent their release into the aquatic environment, advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as ozonation are currently implemented. Ozonation leads to the formation of transformation products (TPs), which then enter the receiving waters. In the present work, laboratory-scale ozonation experiments of valsartan solutions were performed. The resulting TPs were analyzed by HPLC-MS and searched for using a non-targeted approach. Of the 51 compounds detected, 27 have tentative structural suggestions based on MS/MS experiments. Ozonation of valsartan does not lead to the formation of TPs with higher toxicity towards A.\u00a0fischeri than the parent compound. According to QSAR-based environmental behavior estimations, most TPs reveal lower lipophilicity, increased biodegradability as well as decreased acute and chronic toxicities concerning fish, daphnia and algae compared to their parent compound valsartan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
