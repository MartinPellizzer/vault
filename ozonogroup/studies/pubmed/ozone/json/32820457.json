However, few studies have focused on ozone pollution zone identification during pollution processes. A spatial-temporal clustering framework for identifying pollution zones during ozone pollution processes was initially proposed in this study, and an ozone pollution process in China in May 2017 was selected as a case. The results showed that the framework can help selecting one more accurate method to identify the pollution zone according to the pollution characteristics of air pollution process. In addition, different ozone pollution zone identification methods work well in different scenarios: The self-organizing map (SOM) method was suitable for identifying the zone with the duration of pollution between 24 and 48 h, the image fusion based on wavelet transform (IFbWT) method for the zone with the duration of pollution over 48 h and the Apriori method for the zone with obvious boundaries between high-value and low-value ozone concentrations. The proposed procedure can also be applied to identify the pollution zone of the pollution process of other pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8716-1381"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dongyue", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China. liaoyl@lreis.ac.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Nanjing, 210023, China. liaoyl@lreis.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Yilan", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2016YFC1302504", "Agency": "National Key R&D Program of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "41471377, 41531179 and 41421001", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2014FY121100", "Agency": "Program Grant in Fundamental Research from the Ministry of Science and Technology", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32820457", "10.1007/s10661-020-08552-3", "10.1007/s10661-020-08552-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
