Merr.]. Soybean cultivar 'Jake' shows O<sub>3</sub> resilient traits in above-ground organs, but the root system remains sensitive to elevated O<sub>3</sub> (eO<sub>3</sub>). Changing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) resource composition during eO<sub>3</sub> stress suggests that eO<sub>3</sub> presumably alters belowground soil microbial communities and their driven nutrient transformation. Yet, the responses of belowground microbes to eO<sub>3</sub> and their feedback on nutrient cycling in 'Jake' are unknown. In this study, we holistically investigated soil microbial communities associated with C and N dynamics and bacterial-fungal inter-kingdom networks in the rhizosphere and bulk soil at different developmental stages of 'Jake' grown under sub-ambient O<sub>3</sub> [charcoal-filtered (CF) air, 12 h mean: 20 ppb] or eO<sub>3</sub> (12 h mean: 87 ppb). The results demonstrated eO<sub>3</sub> significantly decreased fungal diversity and complexity of microbial networks at different 'Jake' developmental stages, whereas bacterial diversity was more tolerant to eO<sub>3</sub> in both bulk soil and rhizosphere. In the bulk soil, no O<sub>3</sub>-responsive microbial biomarkers were found to be associated with C and N content, implying eO<sub>3</sub> may stimulate niche-based processes during 'Jake' growth. In contrast, this study identified O<sub>3</sub>-responsive microbial biomarkers that may contribute to the N acquisition (Chloroflexales) and C dynamics (Caldilineales, Thermomicrobiales, and Hypocreales) in the rhizosphere, which may support the O<sub>3</sub> resilience of the 'Jake' cultivar. However, further investigation is required to confirm their specific contributions by determining changes in microbial gene expression. Overall, these findings conduce to an expanding knowledge base that O<sub>3</sub> induces temporal and spatial changes in the effects of microbial and nutrient networks in the O<sub>3</sub>-tolerant agriculture ecosystems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
