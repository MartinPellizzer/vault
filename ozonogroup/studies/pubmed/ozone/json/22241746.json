Various air pollutants have been reported, differing in their physicochemical characteristics. They can be grouped into four categories: gaseous pollutants (e.g. ozone, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds), persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals (e.g. cadmium, lead and mercury) and particulate matter (coarse, fine and ultrafine). These pollutants can reach the respiratory system, eliciting pulmonary and/or systemic effects. These effects include inflammation, tissue remodelling and carcinogenesis: all phenomena where matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) play critical roles, given their broad effects on matrix remodelling and modulation of inflammation and cell signalling. Moreover, since expression and activity of MMPs can be induced by such stimuli, the hypothesis has been raised that MMPs could be involved in the health effects of pollutants. Until now, the implication of MMPs in these effects has been studied only for some pollutants and for a restricted selection of MMPs (mainly MMP-1, -2, -9 and -12), while evidence for a link between MMP induction/activation and health effects remains scarce. A larger number of studies is, therefore, needed in order to better understand the implication of MMPs in health effects associated with air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inserm U955, Equipe 4, #Universit\u00e9 Paris Est, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, 94000 Cr\u00e9teil, France. jorge.boczkowski@inserm.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dagouassat", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lanone", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boczkowski", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22241746", "10.1183/09031936.00195811", "09031936.00195811"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
