In the United States, the Air Quality Index (AQI) alerts the public to air quality and provides behavioral recommendations to reduce exposure and harm, yet little is known about the relationship between the AQI and childhood asthma exacerbations. <b>Objectives:</b> To test for association between the AQI and childhood asthma exacerbations resulting in emergency department visits and hospitalizations. <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective time-stratified case-crossover study, conducted using medical records data from 2010 through 2018 for children aged 6-17 years with a primary diagnosis of an asthma exacerbation (defined as an emergency department visit or hospitalization for asthma) at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Daily AQI data was obtained for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania from the Environmental Protection Agency. Conditional logistic regression was used for analyses of the AQI (as both a continuous and categorical variable) and asthma exacerbations. Stratified analyses were conducted to explore modification of the AQI effects on asthma exacerbations by race and other covariates. <b>Results:</b> There were 6,573 events. Particulate matter <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) was the primary pollutant responsible for the AQI, followed by ozone (62% and 29% of days with events, respectively). The overall AQI was associated with asthma exacerbations (e.g., as continuous, per 10-unit increase, Lag\u00a0Day\u00a02: odds ratio [OR], 1.014; 95% confidence interval [CI],\u00a01.003-1.025; Lag Day 3: OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.001-1.023). By pollutant-specific AQI, the association was strongest for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In stratified analyses, the AQI was associated with exacerbations in Black and younger children (6-11 yr) on Lag\u00a0Day 4. <b>Conclusions:</b> The AQI is associated with asthma exacerbations among children in Allegheny County. This is driven primarily by PM<sub>2.5</sub>, with Black and younger children particularly affected. Healthcare providers should discuss the AQI in asthma management."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1202-044X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh."}], "LastName": "Rosser", "ForeName": "Franziska", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8409-3077"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Yueh-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8300-5947"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, and."}], "LastName": "Rothenberger", "ForeName": "Scott D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6497-9885"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh."}], "LastName": "Forno", "ForeName": "Erick", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioral and Community Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}], "LastName": "Mair", "ForeName": "Christina", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6139-5320"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh."}], "LastName": "Celed\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Juan C", "Initials": "JC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "UL1 TR001857", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 MD011764", "Acronym": "MD", "Agency": "NIMHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL149693", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "K08 HL159333", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "KL2 TR001856", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL117191", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Am Thorac Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "101600811", "ISSNLinking": "2325-6621"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Guarnieri M, Balmes JR.
