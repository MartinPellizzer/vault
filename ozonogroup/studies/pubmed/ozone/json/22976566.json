Quadrants of each subject were randomly assigned to four groups and treated accordingly: Group A, scaling and root planing (SRP): Group B, topical ozonated olive oil (OZO) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing: Group C, topical ozonated olive oil as a monotherapy and: Group D, topical chlorhexidine gel as a monotherapy. The quadrants were analyzed clinically by plaque index, gingival index, sulcus bleeding index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level at baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of time intervals. The subjects were also analyzed for perceived pain, discomfort or tooth hypersensitivity (quadrant wise) on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Additionally, subgingival plaque samples were collected from the two predetermined sites of each quadrant at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks for the analysis of total bacterial counts (TBCs) and the detection of frequency of eight putative periodontopathogens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.", "The adjunctive use of the OZO with SRP resulted in a significant improvement (P<0.001) of clinical parameters as well as microbiological parameters over the time and in comparison to the control groups. The OZO as monotherapy also showed a significant improvement (P<0.001) in clinical parameters as well as microbiological parameters over the time without any documented side effects. However, there was a significant increase (P<0.05) in dentinal hypersensitivity following OZO as an adjunct to scaling and root planing therapy.", "The OZO, as an adjunctive therapy as well as a mono-therapy is efficient in improving periodontal conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kalindi Oro Care and Research Centre, Lanka, Uttar Pradesh, India. punitvai@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holmes", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Minerva Stomatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0421071", "ISSNLinking": "0026-4970"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Olive Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gingiva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Olive Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22976566", "R18123533"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
