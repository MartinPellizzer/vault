However, VOCs emissions from broiler houses have been less characterized, and studies of related dominant odorants, carcinogenic risk, and ozone formation potential are still lacking. To fill this research gap, VOCs pollutants emitted from a broiler house were investigated in this study. The VOCs emission characteristics of the broiler house during three different periods of broiler growth (early, middle, and later) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that 77 types of VOCs were detected, including 16 types of halogenated hydrocarbons, 21 types of alkanes, 5 types of olefins, 12 types of aromatic hydrocarbons, 15 types of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), and 8 types of sulfides. During the entire 42-day growth period, the concentrations of halogenated hydrocarbons, alkanes, olefin, aromatic hydrocarbons, and OVOCs in the broiler house showed few changes. However, with the growth of broilers, the intake of sulfur-containing amino acids and the fecal emission coefficient increased, resulting in the gradual conversion of the VOCs to sulfide. Therefore, emissions of sulfur-containing VOCs increased in the early and middle growth periods. Moreover, the increase in ventilation in the house during the later growth period resulted in a decrease in the sulfur-containing VOCs concentrations. The dominant odorants in the broiler house were naphthalene, ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, carbon disulfide, dimethyl disulfide, methanethiol, methanethiol, and thiophene. Methanethiol had the highest odorous values, ranging from 2172.4 to 19090.9. Meanwhile, there were acceptable levels of carcinogenic risk in the early and middle growth periods, with a lifetime cancer risk (LCR) of 7.7\u00d710<sup>-6</sup> and 4.5\u00d710<sup>-6</sup>, respectively. The average ozone formation potential (OFP) was (1458.9\u00b1787.4) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for the monitoring of malodorous substances and formulation of emission reduction strategies in broiler production."]}, "AuthorList":
