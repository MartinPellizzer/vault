Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of depression were included. Data on air pollution levels were extracted from the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection (G\u0142\u00f3wny Inspektorat Ochrony \u015arodowiska - GIO\u015a), and demographic data were extracted from Statistics Poland (G\u0142\u00f3wny Urz\u0105d Statystyczny - GUS).", "The percentage of people diagnosed with depression over the 6-year study period depended on the group of counties homogeneous in terms of air pollution exposure (p < 0.001). We showed statistically significant correlations between different depression diagnoses and exposure to air pollutants. Elevated concentration of airborne fine particles with a diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO), and low benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and cadmium (Cd) levels were independent risk factors for major depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms (F32.3). There was a significant negative correlation between ozone (O3) levels and depression incidence.", "Regions with heavy air pollution had a higher incidence of depression.
