Results show that the three cathodes had different electrocatalytic activity for converting sparged O2 to H2O2, which increased in order of carbon felt, RVC, and carbon-PTFE. The in-situ generated H2O2 then reacts with sparged O3 to yield OH, which can in turn oxidize ozone-refractory DEP toward complete mineralization. In general, satisfactory total organic carbon removal yields (76.4-91.8%) could be obtained after 60min of the E-peroxone treatment with the three carbon-based cathodes, and the highest yield was obtained with the carbon-PTFE cathode due to its highest activity for H2O2 generation. In addition, the carbon-PTFE and carbon felt cathodes exhibited excellent stability over six cycles of the E-peroxone treatment of DEP solutions. Based on the intermediates (e.g., monoethyl phthalate, phthalic acid, phenolics, and carboxylic acids) identified by HPLC-UV, plausible reaction pathways were proposed for DEP mineralization by the E-peroxone process. The results of this study indicate that carbon-based cathodes generally have good electrocatalytic activity and stability for application in extended E-peroxone operations to effectively remove phthalates from water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
