O<sub>3</sub> is formed in the reactions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with light. In this study, an O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode encountered in Shenzhen, South China in 2018 was investigated to illustrate the influence of aerosols on local O<sub>3</sub> production. We used a box model with comprehensive heterogeneous mechanisms and empirical prediction of photolysis rates to reproduce the O<sub>3</sub> episode. Results demonstrate that the aerosol light extinction and NO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous reactions showed comparable influence but opposite signs on the O<sub>3</sub> production. Hence, the influence of aerosols from different processes is largely counteracted. Sensitivity tests suggest that O<sub>3</sub> production increases with further reduction in aerosols in this study, while the continued NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reduction finally shifts O<sub>3</sub> production to an NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regime with respect to traditional O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-VOC sensitivity. Our results shed light on the role of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reduction on O<sub>3</sub> production and highlight further mitigation in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> not only limiting the production of O<sub>3</sub> but also helping to ease particulate nitrate, as a path for cocontrol of O<sub>3</sub> and fine particle pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3808-1964"],
