This study aimed to determine the effect of intradiscal ozone injection on pain score and satisfaction of patients with low back pain (LBP) secondary to disc herniation. Patients with LBP diagnosed with disc herniation were enrolled in this clinical trial. After prepping and draping the area, intradiscal injection of ozone/oxygen mixture (10 ml, 25\u03bcg/ml) was performed under fluoroscopy guide (c-arm). Pain score and patient satisfaction were assessed prior to the injection (baseline) and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the injection. Sixty three patients (24 males, 39 females) with mean age of 53.3 \u00b12.0 y enrolled in the study. The mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) of pain score before intervention was 6.968 \u00b10.11. Pain score was reduced to 4.25\u00b10.19 at 1 month, 4.33\u00b10.20 at 3 months, 4.87 \u00b10.21 at 6 months and 5.22 \u00b10.20 at 24 months. According to the modified MacNab scale success of pain relief was as follows: excellent: 4 (6.3%), good: 17 (26.98 %), sufficient: 13 (20.63 %), poor: 13 (20.63 %), no result: 11 (17.46%), negative: 4 (6.3 %). Intradiscal ozone therapy was determined to provide improved outcomes in patients with single level of bulging and protrusion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Faculty of Medicine, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozcan", "ForeName": "Sibel", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Pain Management, Firat University School of Medicine, Elazig, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muz", "ForeName": "Arzu", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Firat University School of Medicine, Elazig, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yildiz Altun", "ForeName": "Aysun", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Pain Management, Firat University School of Medicine, Elazig, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onal", "ForeName": "Selami Ates", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluoroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intralesional"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug effects", "innervation", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug effects", "innervation", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lumbar Vertebrae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Satisfaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29729693"]}}]}
