This study aims to understand the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals towards ozone therapy. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in a comprehensive hospital between November 2020 and January 2021. In addition to evaluating the sociodemographic characteristics of the healthcare professionals, we performed evaluations through a data collection form that we prepared based on the literature. A total of 544 people were included in the study. We found ozone therapy to be the fifth-most frequently heard (72.2%) and experienced (2%) application among traditional and complementary medical applications. Of the participants, 20.8% (n = 113) correctly answered the questions regarding the methods of application of ozone therapy. We found that the most common route of administration was intravenous administration, with a rate of 56.5% (n = 307). The number of correct answers received for the questions regarding ozone therapy was related to professional experience, sex, and occupation (P = .035, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). We determined that the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals towards ozone therapy are not satisfactory."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yazicioglu", "ForeName": "Bahadir", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oruc", "ForeName": "Muhammet Ali", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Emin Goktepe", "ForeName": "Muhammet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ozturk", "ForeName": "Onur", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude of Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36239564", "AT7635"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
