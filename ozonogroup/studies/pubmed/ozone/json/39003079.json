Herein, \u03b4-MnO<sub>2</sub> is successfully synthesized by a facile ozonation strategy, where Mn<sup>2+</sup> is oxidized by ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) bubble in an alkaline solution. It presents one of the best catalytic properties with a low 100% conversion temperature of 85\u00b0C for 50 ppm of HCHO under a GHSV of 48,000 mL/(g\u00b7hr). As a comparison, more than 6 times far longer oxidation time is needed if O<sub>3</sub> is replaced by O<sub>2</sub>. Characterizations show that ozonation process generates a different intermediate of tetragonal \u03b2-HMnO<sub>2</sub>, which would favor the quick transformation into the final product \u03b4-MnO<sub>2</sub>, as compared with the relatively more thermodynamically stable monoclinic \u03b3-HMnO<sub>2</sub> in the O<sub>2</sub> process. Finally, HCHO is found to be decomposed into CO<sub>2</sub> via formate, dioxymethylene and carbonate species as identified by room temperature in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy. All these results show great potency of this facile ozonation routine for the highly active \u03b4-MnO<sub>2</sub> synthesis in order to remove the HCHO contamination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
