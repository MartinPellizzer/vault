However, the toxicity of treated water increased, suggesting the generation of toxic oxidation products (OPs). In this study, eight OPs of BF ozonation were identified using a LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer coupled with HPLC, and six of them have not been previously reported during BF ozonation. Based on the abundant fragments and high assurance of accurate molar mass, structure elucidation was comprehensively performed and discussed. Hydroxylation, loss of methyl propionic acid group, and Crig\u00e9e mechanism were observed as the oxidation mechanisms of BF ozonation. The toxicity of identified OPs calculated by quantitative structure activity relationship indicated that three OPs were probably more toxic than the precursor compound BF. This result together with the evolution of identified OPs in the treated solutions, indicated that two OPs, namely N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-4-chlorobenzamide and N-(2,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-4-chlorobenzamide, were the potential toxicity-causing OPs during BF ozonation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to identify toxicity-causing OPs during the BF ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4667-9675"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Risk Assessment and Control on Chemical Process, School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology , 200237, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory for Emerging Organic Contaminants Control, Tsinghua University , 100084 Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Sui", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, Environmental Analytical Laboratory, RWTH Aachen University , Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Gebhardt", "ForeName": "Wilhelm", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, Environmental Analytical Laboratory, RWTH Aachen University , Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schr\u00f6der", "ForeName": "Horst Friedrich", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University , 200092 Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wentao", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Risk Assessment and Control on Chemical Process, School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology , 200237, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Shuguang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory for Emerging Organic Contaminants Control, Tsinghua University , 100084 Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9449Q51XH", "NameOfSubstance": "Bezafibrate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bezafibrate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28118709", "10.1021/acs.est.6b03548"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
