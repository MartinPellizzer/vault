Before field deployment, the entire set of instruments was colocated with reference instruments for at least 48 h, comparing hourly averaged data. The standard error of estimate over a typical range 0-50 ppb for the set was 3 \u00b1 2 ppb. Long-term accuracy was assessed over several months by colocation of a subset of ten instruments each at a different reference site. The differences (GSS-reference) of hourly average ozone concentration were normally distributed with mean -1 ppb and standard deviation 6 ppb (6000 measurement pairs). Instrument failures in the field were detected using network correlations and consistency checks on the raw sensor resistance data. Comparisons with modeled spatial O3 fields demonstrate the enhanced monitoring capability of a network that was a hybrid of low-cost and reference instruments, in which GSS sensors are used both to increase station density within a network as well as to extend monitoring into remote areas. This ambitious deployment exposed a number of challenges and lessons, including the logistical effort required to deploy and maintain sites over a summer period, and deficiencies in cell phone communications and battery life. Instrument failures at remote sites suggested that redundancy should be built into the network (especially at critical sites) as well as the possible addition of a \"sleep-mode\" for GSS monitors. At the network design phase, a more objective approach to optimize interstation distances, and the \"information\" content of the network is recommended. This study has demonstrated the utility and affordability of the GSS technology for a variety of applications, and the effectiveness of this technology as a means substantially and economically to extend the coverage of an air quality monitoring network. Low-cost, neighborhood-scale networks that produce reliable data can be envisaged."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Ltd. , P.O.
