After exposure to ozone, methacholine stimulation showed a functional hyperreactivity, whereas after stimulation with histamine a hyporeactivity was observed. These effects could be explained by the release of prostanoids. In a control situation an increase in PGF(2\u03b1), PGE(2) and PGD(2) release is observed after stimulation of the histaminergic receptor system. After ozone exposure the release of prostanoids was also enhanced (unstimulated, PGF(2\u03b1) and TxB(2); histamine, PGF(2\u03b1), PGE(2); methacholine, PGF(2\u03b1), TxB(2), 6-kPGF(1\u03b1), PGE(2)). This study shows that the prostanoid release is strongly dependent on the receptor system stimulated to induce smooth muscle contraction and the importance of prostanoids in ozone-induced changes in guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle reactivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leiden/Amsterdam Center for Drug Research, Department of Pharmacochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1083, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Toxic Effects, Laboratory of Health Effects Research, National Institute of Public Health and Environment, P.O.
