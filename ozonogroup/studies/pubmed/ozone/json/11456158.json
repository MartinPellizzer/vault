A specific instrument designed with the flow injection analysis (FIA) technique enabled us to measure accurately the ozone decomposition rate, which was found to consist of two stages: the instantaneous ozone consumption stage and the slower ozone decay stage. The ozone consumption rate was measured at the initial and secondary stages by determining certain parameters called the instantaneous ozone demand (ID) and the pseudo first-order decay rate constant (k(c)). Using the OH*-probe, the yield of OH* per consumed ozone was also measured to determine its potential to produce OH* for the oxidation of micropollutants during the ozonation process. The ozone consumption of the ID values was significant in most natural waters, and substantial amounts of OH* were found to generate during the instantaneous ozone consumption stage. This study also investigated the effects of particulates, ozone doses, and sequential ozone injection on ozone decomposition kinetics and OH* formation yield."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deparment of Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University at Wonju, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9159UV381P", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroxide ion"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Water Res 2001 Oct;35(14):3515"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11456158", "10.1016/s0043-1354(00)00564-9", "S0043-1354(00)00564-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
