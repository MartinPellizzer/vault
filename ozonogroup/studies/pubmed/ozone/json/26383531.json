Stable carbon isotopic signatures may provide valuable new information on the fate of these compounds as has been seen for other priority hydrocarbon contaminants, but to date no method for extraction and isotopic analysis of dissolved CFCs from groundwaters has been developed. Here we describe a cryogenic purge and trap system coupled to continuous flow compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis mass spectrometry for concentrations as low as 35 \u03bcg/L. The method is validated by comparing isotopic signatures from water extracted CFCs against a new suite of isotopic CFC standards. Fractionation of CFCs in volatilization experiments from pure-phase CFC-11 and CFC-113 resulted in enrichment factors (\u03b5) of +1.7 \u00b1 0.1\u2030 and +1.1 \u00b1 0.1\u2030, respectively, indicating that such volatile loss, if significant, would produce a more (13)C depleted signature in the remaining CFCs. Importantly, no significant fractionation was observed during volatile extraction of dissolved CFCs from aqueous solutions. \u03b4(13)C values for groundwaters from a CFC-contaminated site were, on average, more enriched than \u03b4(13)C values for pure compounds. Such enriched \u03b4(13)C values have been seen in other hydrocarbon contaminants such as chlorinated ethenes and ethanes due to in situ degradation, but definitive interpretation of such enriched signatures in field samples requires additional experiments to characterize fractionation of CFCs during biodegradation. The establishment of a robust and sensitive method of extraction and analysis, as described here, provides the foundation for such future directions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Toronto , Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Horst", "ForeName": "Axel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Toronto , Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Lacrampe-Couloume", "ForeName": "Georges", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Toronto , Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Sherwood Lollar", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Groundwater"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26383531", "10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02701"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
