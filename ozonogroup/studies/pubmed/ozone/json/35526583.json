Simulation results showed that the WRF/Chem model is well suited to simulate the ozone concentrations in this area. In addition, four simulation scenarios (removing the emissions from the northern Zhengzhou, southwestern Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou local and southeastern Zhengzhou) were conducted to explore the specific contributions of local emissions and emissions from surrounding areas within Henan to this ozone pollution episode. We found that contributions from the northern, local, southwestern, and southeastern regions were 6.1%, 5.9%, 1.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. The northern and local emissions of Zhengzhou (only emissions from Zhengzhou) were prominent contributors within the simulation areas. In other words, during this episode, most of the ozone pollution in Zhengzhou appeared to be transported in from regions outside Henan Province."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
