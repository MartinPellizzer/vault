By oxidation and soil washing the biodegradability and bioavailability of these otherwise recalcitrant compounds can be enhanced. The aim of the study was to optimize and integrate soil washing, ozonation (+ hydrogen peroxide) and biological treatment for the remediation of old saw mill soil contaminated by chlorophenols (CPs). The integration of different treatment train variables and the alternation of pHs (3, 7 and 10) and different ozone doses were studied in a laboratory scale. The soil was heavily contaminated aged soil (> 4000 mgCP kg(-1)), so more than 99% of removal should be attained in order to reach the Finnish guideline values. All the individual methods studied were able to degrade/transfer 25 - 95% of the CPs from the soil matrix. By biological treatment only 25% of the CPs were degraded. After soil washing, 40- 80% of the contaminants were transferred from the soil phase and by ozonation 35 - 95% decrease of CPs were achieved. All the methods studied successfully enhanced the biodegradability of the target compound. After biological treatment of ozonated and washed samples even 93 - 100% degradation of CPs was obtained. The most effective treatment was the combination of soil washing + ozonation (in pH 10) followed by biological treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Kuopio, Department of Environmental Sciences, P.O.
