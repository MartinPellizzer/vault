Previous studies have adjusted long-term trends in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations for meteorological effects using various statistical and mathematical methods in order to get a better estimate of the long-term changes in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations due to changes in precursor emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this work, the authors present improvements to the current method used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to adjust O<sub>3</sub> trends for meteorological influences by making refinements to the input data sources and by allowing the underlying statistical model to vary locally using a variable selection procedure. The current method is also expanded by using a quantile regression model to adjust trends in the 90<sup>th</sup> and 98<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, allowing for a better understanding of the effects of local meteorology on peak O<sub>3</sub> levels in addition to seasonal average concentrations. The revised method is used to adjust trends in the May to September mean, 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, and 98<sup>th</sup> percentile MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at over 700 monitoring sites in the U.S. for years 2000 to 2016. The utilization of variable selection and quantile regression allow for a more in-depth understanding of how weather conditions affect O<sub>3</sub> levels in the U.S. This represents a fundamental advancement in our ability to understand how interannual variability in weather conditions in the U.S. may impact attainment of the O<sub>3</sub> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC."}], "LastName": "Wells", "ForeName": "Benjamin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC."}], "LastName": "Dolwick", "ForeName": "Pat", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC."}], "LastName": "Eder", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC."}], "LastName": "Evangelista", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC."}], "LastName": "Foley", "ForeName": "Kristen", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC."}], "LastName": "Mannshardt", "ForeName": "Elizabeth", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC."}], "LastName": "Misenis", "ForeName": "Chris", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC."}], "LastName": "Weishampel", "ForeName": "Anthony", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Atmos Environ (1994)", "NlmUniqueID": "9888534", "ISSNLinking": "1352-2310"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Akaike H (1974).
