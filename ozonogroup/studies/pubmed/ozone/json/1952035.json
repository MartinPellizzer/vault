The main causes of ozone destruction are chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs) 11 and 12. Recently, caring anesthetists have wondered if and to what degree N2O and popular potent inhalation anesthetics may also contribute to ozone loss. Having consulted the literature, we attempt to answer that question. The ozone-destroying N2O is chiefly produced by burning fossil elements and nitrogenous fertilizing used in agriculture; the share of medically used N2O lies below 2%. Halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane are halogenated anesthetics that contain ozone-destroying halogens (bromine, chlorine, fluorine) to different extents. Complicated experimental calculations for these volatile anesthetics result in a potential for ozone destruction of 0.36 for halothane and 0.02 for enflurane and isoflurane if the potential for ozone destruction by CFCs is set at 1.0. The lifespan of the inhalation anesthetics in the troposphere is with less than 3 years, dramatically less than that of CFCs (70-140 years). The two most important CFCs, 11 and 12, are considered to be currently produced in a quantity of about 800,000 tons per year. On the other hand, the worldwide production of inhalation anesthetics is said to be only 2,000 tons. In view of the experimental calculations and the low worldwide production, the small greenhouse effect, the shorter lifespan in the troposphere, and the low potential for ozone destruction, the negative effects of medically used N2O and inhalation anesthetics on the ozone layer seem negligible. All in all, the inhalation anesthetics are considered to be responsible for only 0.0005% of the ozone destruction at present."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zentrum Anaesthesiologie, Rettungs- und Intensivmedizin, Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radke", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabian", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Die Ozonschicht und ihre Beeinflussung durch N2O und Inhalationsanaesthetika."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anaesthesist", "NlmUniqueID": "0370525", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2417"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anesthetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91I69L5AY5", "NameOfSubstance": "Enflurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CYS9AKD70P", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UQT9G45D1P", "NameOfSubstance": "Halothane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anesthetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enflurane"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Halothane"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflurane"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "NumberOfReferences": "18"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1952035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
