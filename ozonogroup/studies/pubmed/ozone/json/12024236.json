Reduction in the earth's stratospheric ozone layer has increased awareness of the potential effects that ultraviolet radiation may have in the environment, including how marine bacteria respond to changes in solar radiation. We examined the use of the bacterial RecA protein as an indicator of the potential of bacteria to repair DNA damage caused by solar UV irradiation using the marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens as a model. RecA is universally present in bacteria and is a regulator protein for the so-called Dark Repair Systems, which include excision repair, postreplication recombinational repair, and mutagenic or SOS repair. Solar UVB and UVA both reduced V. natriegens viability in seawater microcosms. After exposure to unfiltered solar radiation or radiation in which UVB was blocked, survival dropped below 1%, whereas visible light from which UVA and UVB had been filtered had no effect on survival. Using a RecA-specific antibody for detection, RecA protein was induced by solar radiation in a diel pattern in marine microcosms conducted in the Gulf of Mexico. Peak induction was observed at dusk each day. Although RecA expression was correlated with the formation of UVB-induced cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers, longer wavelength UVA radiation also induced recA gene expression. Our results demonstrate that RecA-regulated, light-independent repair is an important component in the ability of marine bacteria to survive exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and that RecA expression is a useful monitor of bacterial repair after exposure to solar UVR."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma 74078, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Booth", "ForeName": "M.G.", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeffrey", "ForeName": "W.H.", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "R.V.", "Initials": "RV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microb Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "7500663", "ISSNLinking": "0095-3628"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12024236", "10.1007/s00248-001-1009-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
