Nowadays, gas phase contaminants coming from different sources are becoming into the main cause of serious human illness. Particularly, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are getting more and more attention from the scientific community due the high level of volatilization showed by these compounds and their toxicity. Decomposition of these compounds using different treatments is requiring lots of new strategies based on novel options. In the present work the use of ozone was proposed as possible alternative treatment in the gaseous phase of VOC's liberated from water by stripping. This study deals with the decomposition by ozone in gaseous phase of model mixtures of BTEX stripped from water. The experiments were realized in a tubular reactor with fixed length (1.5 m length and diameter of 2.5 cm). The experiments were conducted in two stages: in the first one, organics was ventilated by oxygen flow to liberate BTEX to the gaseous phase; second stage deals with the liberated BTEX decomposition by ozone in the tubular reactor. Ozonation efficiency was determined measuring the VOC's concentration at the output of the tubular reactor. This concentration was compared to the concentration obtained at the input of the reactor. The obtained results confirm the possibility to use of ozone for the VOC's decomposition in gaseous phase. Also, the dynamic relationship between degradation and liberation was studied and characterized."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
