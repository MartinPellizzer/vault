However, test methods to measure ozone penetration factors in residences (P) remain limited. We developed a method to measure ozone penetration factors in residences under infiltration conditions and applied it in an unoccupied apartment unit. Twenty-four repeated measurements were made, and results were explored to (i) evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of the new procedure using multiple solution methods, (ii) compare results from 'interference-free' and conventional UV absorbance ozone monitors, and (iii) compare results against those from a previously published test method requiring artificial depressurization. The mean (\u00b1s.d.) estimate of P was 0.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 across a wide range of conditions using the new method with an interference-free monitor; the conventional monitor was unable to yield meaningful results due to relatively high limits of detection. Estimates of P were not clearly influenced by any indoor or outdoor environmental conditions or changes in indoor decay rate constants. This work represents the first known measurements of ozone penetration factors in a residential building operating under natural infiltration conditions and provides a new method for widespread application in buildings."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
