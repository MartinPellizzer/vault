In this study, three facet-engineered \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> was prepared and successfully utilized for catalytic ozonation toward an odorous CH<sub>3</sub>SH. The as-synthesized 310-MnO<sub>2</sub> exhibited superior activity in catalytic ozonation of CH<sub>3</sub>SH than that of 110-MnO<sub>2</sub> and 100-MnO<sub>2</sub>, which could achieve 100% removal efficiency for 70 ppm of CH<sub>3</sub>SH within 20 min. The results of XPS, Raman, H<sub>2</sub>-TPR, and DFT calculation all prove that the (310) facets possess a higher surface energy than other facets can feature the construction of oxygen vacancies, thus facilitating the adsorption and activate O<sub>3</sub> into intermediate peroxide species (O<sup>2-</sup>/O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and reactive oxygen species (\u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>/<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) for eliminating adjacent CH<sub>3</sub>SH. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) revealed that the CH<sub>3</sub>SH molecular was chemisorbed on S atom to form CH<sub>3</sub>S<sup>-</sup>, which was further converted into intermediate CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and finally oxidized into SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>/CO<sub>2</sub> during the process. Attributed to the deep oxidation of CH<sub>3</sub>SH on 310-MnO<sub>2</sub> via efficient cycling of active oxygen vacancies, the lifetime of 310-MnO<sub>2</sub> can be extended to 2.5 h with limited loss of activity, while 110-MnO<sub>2</sub> and 100-MnO<sub>2</sub> were inactivated within 1 h. This study deepens the comprehension of facet-engineering in MnO<sub>2</sub> and presents an efficient and portable catalyst to control odorous pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3875-5631"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yunchen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhiyao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yajing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Yuhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6016-358X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Dehua", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5144-8372"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Shuncheng", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32877602", "10.1021/acs.est.0c05235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
