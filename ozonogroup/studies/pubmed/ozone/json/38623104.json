The aim of this study was to compare the effect of different virucidal disinfecting methods on the dimensional accuracy and surface detail reproduction (SDR) of impression materials. Methods A total of 160 samples were fabricated with different impression materials using zinc oxide eugenol (Group 1), alginate (Group 2), polyether (Group 3), and addition silicone (Group 4) impression materials, each containing 40 samples (n=40). These groups were further divided into Subgroups A, B, C, and D (n=10) based on the disinfecting method used. Disinfection was carried out\u00a0using 0.2% peracetic acid (A), a natural polymer of glucosamine (B), ultraviolet (UV) radiation (C), and ozonated water (D). The disinfected impressions were poured in type IV gypsum, and the obtained casts were checked for dimensional accuracy and surface detail reproduction (SDR). For dimensional accuracy, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and, for surface detail reproduction, the chi-square test were used to compare the different subgroups of each impression material separately. Results Zinc oxide eugenol samples showed the lowest mean dimensional change when disinfected with 0.2% peracetic acid (1A=154.1 \u00b5m), and alginate showed the lowest mean dimensional change when disinfected using ozonated water (2D=134.9 \u00b5m). On the other hand, the lowest mean dimensional change observed in polyether and addition silicone samples was those which were disinfected using UV radiation (3C=100.9 \u00b5m and 4C=113.5 \u00b5m). Surface detail was reproduced adequately in most of the samples. Conclusion A 0.2% peracetic acid could be used to disinfect zinc oxide eugenol impressions, ozonated water for alginate impressions, and UV radiation for polyether and addition silicone impressions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Sabharwal et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, Institute of Technology and Science (ITS) Dental College, Ghaziabad, IND."}], "LastName": "Sabharwal", "ForeName": "Niharika", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, JN Kapoor Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) Dental College, Yamunanagar, IND."}], "LastName": "Arora", "ForeName": "Aman", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, JN Kapoor Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) Dental College, Yamunanagar, IND."}], "LastName": "Upadhyaya", "ForeName": "Viram", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, JN Kapoor Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) Dental College, Yamunanagar, IND."}], "LastName": "Sehgal", "ForeName": "Monika M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, Institute of Technology and Science (ITS) Dental College, Ghaziabad, IND."}], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Karvika", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endodontics, Institute of Technology and Science (ITS) Dental College, Ghaziabad, IND."}], "LastName": "Katyal", "ForeName": "Setu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, JN Kapoor Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) Dental College, Yamunanagar, IND."}], "LastName": "Dahiya", "ForeName": "Manisha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, JN Kapoor Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) Dental College, Yamunanagar, IND."}], "LastName": "Pratap", "ForeName": "Chandrama", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Prosthodontics, JN Kapoor Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) Dental College, Yamunanagar, IND."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Radhika", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Consistent detection of 2019 novel coronavirus in saliva.
