Previous studies on plum blossom have mostly focused on Volatile Oils, Flavonoids, Phenylpropanoids, and other compounds, whereas few studies have focused on low molecular weight polypeptide (LMWP) of plum blossom. This research provides a reference for the deep processing and utilization of plum blossom.", "(a) Plum blossom low molecular weight polypeptides protect HaCaT cells against UVB-induced oxidative damage in vitro and the underlying mechanism. (b) Improve the theoretical basis for the intense processing and utilization of plum blossom.", "The safe concentration of LMWP and the survival rate of HaCaT cells were determined using the CCK-8 experiment. The fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was identified using the dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) method; Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were measured in ruptured cells; Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression levels of three proteins: nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and benzoquinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1).", "It was noted that a certain concentration of LMWP could promote cell proliferation. In oxidatively damaged HaCaT cells, SOD levels and survival rates were markedly reduced, but ROS and MDA levels were elevated. However, after treatment with LMWP, the survival rate of the cells and SOD levels were markedly increased, and the levels of ROS and MDA were markedly decreased. As shown by Western blotting, the model group exhibited lower levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 expression than the control group, whereas LMWP-treated cells had significantly higher levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 expression than their model-treated counterparts.", "LMMP can effectively protect HaCaT cells against oxidative damage in vitro induced by UVB, and the underlying mechanism is linked to the activation of the transcription factor Nrf2."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Authors.
