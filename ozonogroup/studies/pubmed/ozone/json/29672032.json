The challenge of oxidative abatement of organic micropollutants is the formation of transformation products with unknown (eco)toxicological consequences. Four aspects need to be considered for oxidative micropollutant abatement: (i) Reaction kinetics, controlling the efficiency of the process, (ii) mechanisms of transformation product formation, (iii) extent of formation of disinfection byproducts from the matrix, (iv) oxidation induced biological effects, resulting from transformation products and/or disinfection byproducts. It is impossible to test all the thousands of organic micropollutants in the urban water cycle experimentally to assess potential adverse outcomes of an oxidation. Rather, we need multidisciplinary and automated knowledge-based systems, which couple predictions of kinetics, transformation and disinfection byproducts and their toxicological consequences to assess the overall benefits of oxidation processes. A wide range of oxidation processes has been developed in the last decades with a recent focus on novel electricity-driven oxidation processes. To evaluate these processes, they have to be compared to established benchmark ozone- and UV-based oxidation processes by considering the energy demands, economics, the feasibilty, and the integration into future water treatment systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag , Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , Ueberlandstrasse 133 , 8600 Duebendorf , Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) , \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , 1015 , Lausanne , Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics , ETH Zurich , 8092 Zurich , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6852-8977"], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29672032", "10.1021/acs.est.8b00586"]}}]}
