For three consecutive growing seasons (1997-2000), we studied the biological impacts (morphology, physiology, demography and phenology) of natural UV-B radiation on a perennial Salicornia ambigua Michx. community in San Sebastian Bay (53 degrees S and 68 degrees W), Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. This is the first UV-B screening experiment on a subantarctic halophytic community. The shortwave UV-B spectrum (280 to 320 nm) was excluded by covering plots with UV-B blocking film (Mylar). These plots were compared to controls covered with UV-B transparent (Aclar) plastic screens, and unscreened plots. Shoot length in Salicornia was not affected by UV-B. Exposure to natural UV-B reduced biomass and density (by 17% and 38%, respectively). Concentration of UV-shielding pigments and cuticle thickness were both significantly higher (25-48% and 21-40%, respectively) in plants receiving ambient UV-B. The increase in cuticle thickness persisted throughout the growing season, whereas pigment concentration was higher at the beginning of the growing season. Also, the number of dead shoots was higher in plants exposed to UV-B. At the end of the growing season (March) shoot mortality was higher in plants exposed to ambient UV-B, and post-flowering senescence was 30 days earlier. Slight changes in the relative composition of Salicornia to Puccinellia were seen. The reduction observed in Salicornia shoot density under ambient UV-B was cumulative over time; 23% in the first growing-season, rising to 38% by the third growing-season. A similar incremental increase in pigment absorption at 305 nm was seen; 25% in the first and 48% in the third growing season."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro Austral de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CONICET), CC. 92 (9410) Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. o_bianciotto@gmx.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bianciotto", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinedo", "ForeName": "L B", "Initials": "LB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "San Roman", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blessio", "ForeName": "A Y", "Initials": "AY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Collantes", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Argentina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Height"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chenopodiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12962642", "10.1016/s1011-1344(03)00089-7", "S1011134403000897"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
