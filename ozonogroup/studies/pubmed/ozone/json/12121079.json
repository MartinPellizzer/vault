Most mechanistic studies to date have focused on the role of syn carbonyl oxides; however, OH production from ethene ozonolysis indicates a second, poorly understood OH-forming channel, which may contribute to OH production in the ozonolysis of substituted alkenes as well. Using laser-induced fluorescence, we have measured OH and OD yields from the ozonolysis of two partially deuterated alkenes, cis- and trans-3-hexene-3,4-d2. OD is formed from both alkenes, indicating a pathway of hydroxyl-radical formation involving vinylic hydrogens, accounting for one-third of total OH formation from cis-3-hexene. The lack of a significant kinetic isotope effect suggests this pathway is the \"hot acid\" channel, arising from rearrangement of anti carbonyl oxides. Measured yields also allow for the estimation of syn:anti carbonyl oxide ratios, approximately 50:50 for trans-3-hexene and approximately 20:80 for cis-3-hexene, qualitatively consistent with our understanding of ozonide decomposition pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA. kroll@huarp.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kroll", "ForeName": "Jesse H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donahue", "ForeName": "Neil M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cee", "ForeName": "Victor J", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demerjian", "ForeName": "Kenneth L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "James G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12121079", "10.1021/ja0266060", "ja0266060"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
