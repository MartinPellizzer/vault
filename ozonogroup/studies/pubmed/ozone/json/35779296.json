In particular, the daily maximum 8-hr average O<sub>3</sub> (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) concentration frequently exceeds the standard. The goal of this study is to find a solution for reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> simultaneously by numerical modeling. After the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC<sub>S</sub>)-limited and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>)-limited areas were defined in Taiwan, then, in total, 50 scenarios are simulated in this study. In terms of the average in Taiwan, the effect of VOC<sub>S</sub> emission reduction is better than that of NO<sub>X</sub> on the decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration, when the same reduction proportion (20%, 40%) is implemented. While the effect of further NO<sub>X</sub> emission reduction (60%) will exceed that of VOC<sub>S</sub>. The decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> is proportional to the reduction in precursor emissions such as NO<sub>X</sub>, VOC<sub>S</sub>, sulfur dioxides (SO<sub>2</sub>), and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). The lower reduction of NO<sub>X</sub> emission for whole Taiwan caused O<sub>3</sub> increases on average but higher reduction can ease the increase, which suggests the implement of NO<sub>X</sub> emission reductions must be cautious. When comparing administrative jurisdictions in terms of grids, districts/towns, and cities/counties, it was found that controlling NO<sub>X</sub> and VOC<sub>S</sub> at a finer spatial resolution of control units did not benefit the decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> but did benefit the decrease in O<sub>3</sub>. The enhanced O<sub>3</sub> control strategies obviously cause a higher decrease of O<sub>3</sub> throughout Taiwan due to NO<sub>X</sub> and VOC<sub>S</sub> emission changes when they are implemented in the right places. Finally, three sets of short-term and long-term goals of controlling PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> simultaneously are drawn from the comprehensive rankings for all simulated scenarios, depending on whether PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> control is more urgent. In principle, the short-term scenarios could be ordinary or enhanced version of O<sub>3</sub> decrease with lower NO<sub>X</sub>/VOC<sub>S</sub> emissions, while the long-term scenario is enhanced version of O<sub>3</sub> decrease plus high emission reductions for all precursors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
