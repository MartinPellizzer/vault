An interquartile range (IQR) increase of median household income reduced the predicted average PM2.5 level by 0.10 \u00b5g/m3. The opposite relationship was true for O3. An IQR increase of median household income increased the predicted average O3 measure by 0.11 ppb.", "The analyses demonstrate that SES and race/ethnicity are related to predicted estimates of PM2.5 and O3 for census tracts in North Carolina.
