OH and Cl rate coefficients obtained by both techniques were indistinguishable, within experimental precision, and the average values were k1 = (7.82 \u00b1 0.55) \u00d7 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k2 = (3.45 \u00b1 0.24) \u00d7 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), respectively. The quoted uncertainties are at 95% level of confidence and include the estimated systematic uncertainties. An upper limit for the O3 rate coefficient was determined to be k3 < 9.0 \u00d7 10(-22) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). In global warming potential (GWP) calculations, radiative efficiency (RE) was determined from the measured IR absorption cross-sections and treating HFIB both as long (LLC) and short (SLC) lived compounds, including estimated lifetime dependent factors in the SLC case. The HFIB lifetime was estimated from kinetic measurements considering merely the OH reaction, \u03c4OH = 14.8 days and including both OH and Cl chemistry, \u03c4eff = 10.3 days. Therefore, GWP(HFIB,OH) and GWP(HFIB,eff) were estimated to be 4.1 (LLC) and 0.6 (SLC), as well as 2.8 (LLC) and 0.3 (SLC) for a hundred year time horizon. Moreover, the estimated photochemical ozone creation potential (\u03b5(POCP)) of HFIB was calculated to be 4.60. Finally, HCHO and (CF3)2C(O) were identified as final oxidation products in both OH- and Cl-initiated oxidation, while HC(O)Cl was additionally observed in the Cl-initiated oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Photochemistry and Kinetics, Department of Chemistry, University of Crete, 71003, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. bpapadim@uoc.gr."}], "LastName": "Papadimitriou", "ForeName": "Vassileios C", "Initials": "VC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Spitieri", "ForeName": "Christina S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Papagiannakopoulos", "ForeName": "Panos", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cazaunau", "ForeName": "Mathieu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lendar", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Da\u00eble", "ForeName": "V\u00e9ronique", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "Abdelwahid", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26372403", "10.1039/c5cp03840e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
