Semen quality was assessed according to standardized methods outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Manual 1999 and 2010, including total sperm count, progressive sperm motility (%), rapid progressive sperm motility (%), and sperm with normal morphology (%). All designated national air quality automatic continuous monitoring stations measured the levels of air pollution [particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)], and was documented by Environmental Protection Administration in Taiwan. We collected data on the levels of air pollution based on the participants' residential addresses.", "In our study, we found that progressive and rapid progressive sperm motility significantly decreased annually (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, increasing age influenced total sperm count, progressive sperm motility, rapid progressive sperm motility, and sperm with normal morphology (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Among different air pollution, we observed SO<sub>2</sub> was associated with lower rapid progressive sperm motility and lower sperm with normal morphology (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.103, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.118, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, respectively). However, NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with higher rapid progressive sperm motility and a high number of sperm with normal morphology (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.129, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.127, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively).", "The semen quality in southern Taiwan appears to have declined in recent years. The participant's age for semen analysis was most strongly associated with semen parameters, Moreover, a significant association between SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> levels and semen motility was observed, even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Further study is required to analyze the dose-dependent effect of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> on semen parameters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
