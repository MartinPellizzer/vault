We applied a time-stratified case-crossover analysis taking temporal variation, meteorological conditions and autocorrelation into account. We computed associations between daily ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5--particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 or 2.5 \u03bcm, respectively) or ozone (O3) and hospital admissions for cardiovascular illnesses.", "We found for CO, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 adverse relationships to cardiovascular admissions while effect strength and lag depended on the pollutant and on the disease group. By trend, in 1-pollutant models most adverse pollutants were NO2 and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) followed by CO, while in 2-pollutant models effects of PM10 persisted in most cases whereas other effects weakened. In addition the strongest effects seemed to be immediate or with a delay of up to 2 days. Adverse effects of ozone could not be detected.", "Our results provided evidence for adverse health effects of combined exposure to airborne pollutants. Different pollutants accounted for varying adverse effects within different cardiovascular disease groups. Taking case numbers and effect strength of all cardiovascular diseases into account, mitigation measures should address all pollutants but especially NO2, PM10, and CO."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Core Facility Studies, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Leipzig, Germany.
