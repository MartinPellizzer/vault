Caries-affected dentin (CAD) samples were randomly distributed into groups based on methods of disinfection (n\u00a0=\u00a010). Group 1: chlorhexidine, group 2: ow, group 3: KTPL, group 4: Triphala, and group 5: ICGP. Following disinfection, specimens were applied with Adper prime and bond NT and then restored with resin composite. All specimens were positioned in a jig of the universal testing machine for shear bond strength (SBS). The debonded samples were analyzed under a stereomicroscope at 40x magnification to determine the type of failure. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD tests were used keeping the level of significance p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.", "The highest bond of adhesive resin was displayed by group 2 specimens cleaned using OW (16.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 MPa). Whereas, the lowest bond integrity was observed by group 5 specimens disinfected using ICGP (11.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 MPa). It was observed samples disinfected with OW (16.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 MPa) in group 2 and samples in group 4 (16.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26 MPa) treated with Triphala displayed comparable outcomes of bond strength (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). It was observed that group 2 (70%) and 4 (80%) treated specimens accounted mostly for cohesive failure. However, groups 1 (80%), 3 (60%), and 5 (70%) displayed an adhesive failure pattern.", "OW and Triphala displayed better bond integrity of adhesive resin to CAD and therefore have the potential to be used as a cavity disinfectant in clinical settings. However, ICGP and KTPL displayed weak bonds of adhesive to CAD. More work is needed to extrapolate the findings of the present study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
