Here, we compared various preparation methods to create a defect-enriched Ag-MnO<sub><i>x</i></sub> nanocomposite that exhibits a remarkably multifunctional activity in VOC combustion and ozone decomposition. Ag<sup>+</sup> ions were well-dispersed in the microtunnels of Ag-MnO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-H via hydrothermal replacement of the original K<sup>+</sup> ions; this catalyst's benzene combustion efficiency (<i>T</i><sub>90%</sub> = 216 \u00b0C at a space velocity of 90\u2009000 mL h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) was comparable to that of typical noble metal catalysts. Moreover, the decomposition of ozone over the Ag-MnO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-H catalyst (space velocity = 840\u2009000 mL h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) under a relative humidity of 60% was above 90%, indicating that it is a promising material for ozone elimination in practical application. The local structure results indicated that silver incorporation via the hydrothermal method facilitates the formation of nonstoichiometric defects in the MnO<sub><i>x</i></sub> matrix. The large number of active oxygen species related to O vacancies appeared to play critical roles in VOC combustion; moreover, the oxygen vacancies originating from O defects were also critical in O<sub>3</sub> abatement. This work provides multifunctional catalysts for VOC combustion and ambient O<sub>3</sub> decomposition and may assist with the rational design of MnO<sub><i>x</i></sub> catalysts for application in various conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5258-906X"], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Shunyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-0669"], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jinzhu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lian", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2124-0620"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Changbin", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31415165", "10.1021/acs.est.9b01822"]}}]}
