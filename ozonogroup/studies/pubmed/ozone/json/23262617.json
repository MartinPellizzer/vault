The instrument was operated in solar occultation mode during a two-month measurement campaign at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, UK, in winter 2010/2011, and ultrahigh-resolution (60 MHz or 0.002 cm(-1)) transmission spectra were recorded for multiple narrow spectral windows (~1 cm(-1) width) specific to each molecule. The ultrahigh spectral resolution of the EC-QC-LHR allows retrieving altitudinal profiles from transmission spectra that contain only few (1-3) significant absorption lines of a target molecule. Profiles are validated by comparing with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational atmospheric profiles (ozone and water), with other data in the literature (nitrous oxide, methane, dichlorodifluoromethane), and with retrievals from a lower resolution (600 MHz or 0.02 cm(-1)) Fourier transform spectroscopy data that were also recorded during the measurement campaign."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electrical Engineering Department, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Tracy R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rose", "ForeName": "Rebecca A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weidmann", "ForeName": "Damien", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wysocki", "ForeName": "Gerard", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23262617", "10.1364/AO.51.008779", "247193"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
