Due to the cosmetic disfigurement it produces and its psychological impact, especially to women, aging of the skin has become an issue of great social significance and concern. Intrinsic aging is an inevitable, genetically programmed process, the underlying mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. No prevention or effective treatment is currently available [1]. Among extrinsic influences (wind, heat, cigarette smoke, chemicals, etc.), ultraviolet radiation appears to be the single most important factor associated with aging of the skin [2]. Photoaging refers to gross and microscopic cutaneous changes induced by cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These changes are superimposed on the background of intrinsic aging [2]. Increased recreational sun exposure, including excessive sunbathing, the depletion of stratospheric ozone, the use of UVR in the treatment of various skin diseases, are some of the causes that have led to increased prevalence of photoaging during the last decades. The clinical importance of photoaging lies mostly on the potential for the development of precancerous lesions or skin cancer [3]. In contrast to intrinsic aging, photodamage can be prevented by sun avoidance and proper sun protection [2]. Furthermore, overwhelming clinical and histological evidence indicate that skin changes of photoaging can be reversed by the use of topical retinoids [4]."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National University of Athens, Department of Dermatology and Venereology, A.
