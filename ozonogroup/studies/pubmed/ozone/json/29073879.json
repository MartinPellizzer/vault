Eight monitoring stations, ranging from urban-industrial to rural-background, were operated across three east-central U.S. states. Annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations ranged from 12.6 to 21.3 micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), with an overall mean of 15.7 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Likewise, annual average PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations ranged from 17.8 to 33.7 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, with an overall mean of 23.7 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. High summer-low winter seasonality was evident, particularly for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, with the highest monthly PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations in August (26.4 and 37.5 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively) and the lowest in February (9.9 and 15.3 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively). A strong association (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.84) was found between PM and PM mass with PM mass contributing, on average, 67% of PM<sub>10</sub> mass. Applying TVA's PM<sub>2 5</sub>/PM<sub>10</sub> ratio to recent (1993-1995) regional high-volume PM<sub>10</sub> Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) data for the east-central United States suggests that as many as 80% of monitored counties would have equaled or exceeded the level of the new annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> metric of 15 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. A decline in average PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass on the order of 3-5 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> from 1982 through 1991 is also suggested. Daily PM<sub>2 5</sub> mass appears to be reasonably well associated (r = 0.47) with maximum hourly ozone during the warmer months (spring through fall). Sulfate compounds comprise a major portion of the measured PM<sub>2 5</sub> mass, with that fraction being highest in the summer months. Viewed collectively, these data suggest that although compliance with the annual and 24-hr PM and 24-hr PM metrics should prove readily attainable, the annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> metric will present a major regulatory management challenge for much of the east-central United States."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Research & Services , Tennessee Valley Authority , Muscle Shoals , Alabama , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parkhurst", "ForeName": "William J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Research & Services , Tennessee Valley Authority , Muscle Shoals , Alabama , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanner", "ForeName": "Roger L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Research & Services , Tennessee Valley Authority , Muscle Shoals , Alabama , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weatherford", "ForeName": "Frances P", "Initials": "FP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Research & Services , Tennessee Valley Authority , Muscle Shoals , Alabama , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valente", "ForeName": "Ralph J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Aeronomy Laboratory, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration , Boulder , Colorado , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meagher", "ForeName": "James F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29073879", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463894"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
