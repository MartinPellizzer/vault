This study documented information about architectural coating VOC emission characteristics to facilitate formulation of control strategies by environmental management departments. This research was based on measured data for architectural wall and waterproof coatings to identify localized emission factors, used industry research to compile additional information, and was combined with the Beijing completed building inventory, to develop a compilation method for VOC emissions from architectural coatings. According to the above research to estimate VOC emissions of the interior wall, exterior wall and waterproof coatings in 2015, analysis of the spatial distribution of VOCs was performed and VOC emissions were estimated under two conditions regarding whether to limit the content of hazardous substances in architectural coatings from 2002-2015. The results show that \u2460VOC emissions from the Beijing architechtural wall and waterproof coating was about 6914.2t\u00b7a<sup>-1</sup> in 2015. The emissions from wall paint and waterproof coating were 2394.9 t\u00b7a<sup>-1</sup>and 4519.3 t\u00b7a<sup>-1</sup>, accounting for 34.6% and 65.4%, respectively. \u2461The spatial distribution of VOC emissions showed that emissions were mainly concentrated around the new cities being developed in the Chaoyang and Tongzhou districts. The district with the highest VOC emission is Tongzhou District, where the proportion of emission is about 13.2%. Following it are the Changping and Chaoyang districts, respectively, at 11.8% and 10.5%. \u2462In 2015, because of implementation of the standards < Indoor decorating and refurbishing materials-Limit of harmful substances of interior architectural coatings > (GB 18582-2008) and < Limit of harmful substances of exterior wall coatings > (GB 24408-2009), compared to the no control scenario, the VOCs emissions under control scenario was one where VOCs emissions were reduced by 8954.2 t. \u2463It follows that environmental management and control of the hazardous substance contents of architectural coatings can effectively control the VOC emission in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resource Environment and Tourism, Capital Normal University, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Zi-Yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Mei-Ping", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Shunyi District Environmental Protection Bureau, Beijing 101300, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qing-Wei", "Initials": "QW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30229585", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201801087"]}}]}
