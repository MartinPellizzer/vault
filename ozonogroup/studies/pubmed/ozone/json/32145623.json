The study on pollution characteristics of VOC, which are important precursors of O<sub>3</sub> and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) contributing PM2.5, is of great significance for providing a reference to guide its reduction policy formulation. Herein, the seasonal variation of atmospheric VOCs and meteorological conditions at the sampling frequency of 1 time per hour were continuously measured from March 2016 to January 2017 in Beijing. Using the collected data combined with multiple models, the role of VOCs in SOA and O<sub>3</sub> production was investigated. Alkanes were the most abundant species, contributing 54.1-64.7% of the total VOC concentration for four seasons, followed by aromatics, alkenes and acetylene. The SOA potential (SOAP) was highest in winter at 2885.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, followed by autumn, spring and summer. Aromatics were the main contributors to SOAP, accounting for ~98.2% of the total SOAP during the entire observation period. The empirical kinetic modeling approach results showed that O<sub>3</sub> production featured the VOC-limited regime in Beijing. Alkenes and aromatics were major contributors to O<sub>3</sub> formation potential (OFP), accounting for 33.1-45.6% and 27.2-45.2%, respectively, particularly ethylene and m,p-xylene. Positive matrix factorization results indicated that motor vehicle exhaust was still the largest local source of VOCs, but its proportion was considerably reduced. The potential source contribution function results revealed that regional transport sources of VOC pollution in Beijing mainly came from the northwest and southern areas. Thus, to control PM2.5 and O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Beijing, the restriction of alkenes and aromatics emission, accompanied by regional cooperation combined with local control, is essential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
