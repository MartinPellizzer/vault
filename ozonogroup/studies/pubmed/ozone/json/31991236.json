CARTaGENE is a public research platform created for investigating the associations of environmental, genomic, and lifestyle factors on chronic diseases. Ambient NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimates, derived from ground-measurement and chemical-transport-model simulated concentrations, were assigned to subjects based on residential postal codes at the time of blood collection. Our models adjusted for age, sex, French Canadian origin, smoking, and family income.", "Concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were closely correlated in space.
