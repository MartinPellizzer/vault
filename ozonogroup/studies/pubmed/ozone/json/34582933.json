Potassium permanganate, chlorine, and ozone treatments were used for pre-oxidation, which effectively attenuated some TrOCs, particularly the combination of MAR with ozone achieved 84-99% attenuation. The pre-oxidation step using potassium permanganate showed high removal of carbamazepine (96%). Moreover, MAR was also combined with nanofiltration (NF) as a multi-barrier concept for the removal of persistent TrOCs after MAR. A short-chain polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) was effectively removed after combining MAR columns with NF membranes. Thus, pre-oxidation coupled with MAR followed by NF could potentially enhance the removal of selected TrOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
