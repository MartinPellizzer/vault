At solar maximum, a warming of the summer stratosphere was found to strengthen easterly winds, which penetrated into the equatorial upper troposphere, causing poleward shifts in the positions of the subtropical westerly jets, broadening of the tropical Hadley circulations, and poleward shifts of the storm tracks. These effects are similar to, although generally smaller in magnitude than, those observed in nature. A simulation in which only solar irradiance was changed showed a much weaker response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Space and Atmospheric Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London SW7 2BZ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haigh", "ForeName": "JD", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8662582", "10.1126/science.272.5264.981"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
