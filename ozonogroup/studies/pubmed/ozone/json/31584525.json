They were randomly assigned into 2 groups: first group comprised 44 patients treated with intralesional ozone gas, and the second group comprised 30 patients who received intralesional saline injection. In both groups, warts in all patients were directly injected weekly until complete clearance occurred or for a maximum of 10 treatment sessions. The subjects were followed for 6 months to record any recurrences.", "In the ozone group, 25 patients (56.8%) had a complete response with an excellent cosmetic outcome, 15 patients (34.1%) showed a partial response, and 4 patients (9.1%) had no response.
