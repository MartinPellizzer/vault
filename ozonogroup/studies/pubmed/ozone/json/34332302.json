In this study, it was investigated in terms of electron-donating-moieties (EDMs) and UVA<sub>254</sub> for a representative natural organic matter from Suwanee river (SRNOM). Pre-ozonation suppressed the post-chlorination of SRNOM through oxidation of almost all EDMs (>85%) and UVA<sub>254</sub> (>90%) in high MW fractions (HMW, >3.2\u00a0kDa) and moderate EDMs (43%) and UVA<sub>254</sub> (72%) in medium MW fractions (MMW, 1.0-3.2\u00a0kDa). Furthermore, pre-ozonation led to comparable abatements of EDMs and UVA<sub>254</sub> for HMW fractions, but lower abatement of EDMs than UVA<sub>254</sub> for MMW fractions. However, when t-BuOH was used as an <sup>\u2022</sup>OH-quencher, pre-ozonation led to a few instances in which there were higher abatements of EDMs than UVA<sub>254</sub> for the MMW fraction. These findings suggested that the HMW fraction dominantly underwent ring-cleavage of phenols via O<sub>3</sub>- or <sup>\u2022</sup>OH-oxidation. Differently, the MMW fraction underwent ring-cleavage of phenols and quinones-formation via O<sub>3</sub>-oxidation, but occasionally underwent hydroxylation and hydro-phenol formation via <sup>\u2022</sup>OH-oxidation. Because of forehand elimination of reactive moieties (e.g. EDMs), pre-ozonation obviously inhibited the formation of representative DBPs (67%-84% inhibition), total organic chloride (51% inhibition) and cytotoxicity (31% inhibition), but may have promoted the formation of carbonyl-DBPs (trichloroacetone and chloral hydrate). When compared with UVA<sub>254</sub>, EDMs would better for surrogate of DBPs formation. EDM abatement surrogated the formation of total organic chlorine (TOCl) and cytotoxicity following a two-stage phase, possibly because the speciation of DBPs and transformation products varied with the abatement of EDMs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
