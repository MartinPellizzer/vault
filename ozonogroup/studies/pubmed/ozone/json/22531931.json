Furthermore, three additional ozone and other phytotoxic pollutant (NO(x), SO(2) and NH(3)) monitoring networks were installed in 2000 in Retezat (11 locations) and during 2006-2009 in Bucegi-Piatra Craiului (22 locations) LTER Sites. Since 2007, in four Intensive Forest Monitoring plots (level II), measurements of ozone concentrations were developed. Measurements were made using the Ogawa\u00ae passive sampler system during the growing season (April to October). In the Bucegi LTER Site, the seasonal means of 42.5-47.2 ppb in 2006 and 2008 were higher than those determined in the Carpathian Network in the 1997-1999 period (39.0-42.0 ppb), while the 2009 mean of 40.0 ppb was in the range of these values. The O(3) levels were slightly higher than those measured in Retezat LTER Site. In the Intensive Forest Monitoring Network (level II), no significant differences in ozone concentrations between individual core plots were noticed. The seasonal means for each plot range between 36.8 and 49.8 ppb in 2008. An influence of ozone concentrations on crown condition and tree volume growth was not determined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forest Research and Management Institute, Eroilor Bld. 128, 77190 Voluntari, Ilfov, Romania. diana.silaghi@icas.ro obadea@icas.ro"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silaghi", "ForeName": "Diana", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Badea", "ForeName": "Ovidiu", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Romania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22531931", "10.1039/c2em30022b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
