The backward trajectories were then combined with the hourly concentration data of O<sub>3</sub> in Nanjing for trajectories clustering analysis and potential pollution sources analysis. The results show that in 2017, the maximum daily 8 h running average O<sub>3</sub> level in Nanjing was around 12-261 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> with 58 days of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Nanjing, mainly in the spring and summer. The monthly variation of O<sub>3</sub> showed a single peak, with the highest O<sub>3</sub> concentration, as well as the most days exceeding the standard, occurring in June; the diurnal variation of O<sub>3</sub> was unimodal and reached its peak around 14:00. A total number of 5136 trajectories were obtained by simulation, among which the exceeded trajectories accounted for approximately 10%. The exceedance trajectories in May and June were significantly higher, accounting for 60% of the total exceedance trajectories. Six ground-level air mass transporting pathways were identified through clustering analysis, from the NNE, NW, SW, SSE, SE, and NE directions. The SE and SSE directions with higher O<sub>3</sub> levels were the dominant transport routes of O<sub>3</sub> pollution, contributing to 23.33% and 20.76% of backward trajectories, respectively. As for the potential pollution source analysis, the area with high WCWT value distribution matched the WPSCF result, indicating that the potential sources of O<sub>3</sub> pollution were mainly distributed in Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Huzhou, and other cities around Taihu Lake. Additionally, cities located around Nanjing, such as Taizhou, Ma'anshan, Wuhu, Chuzhou, Nantong, and Lianyungang, were considered the secondary potential sources. The results indicate that O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Nanjing is a regional issue and its control requires joint prevention and control strategies in the Yangtze River Delta."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Fang-Jian", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Environmental Monitoring Center of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Bureau of Ecology and Environment, Nanjing 210017, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wen-Qing", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yi-Song", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yi-He", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Municipal Academy of Ecological and Environment Protection Science, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qing-Jiu", "Initials": "QJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring & Pollution Control, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33372460", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202005077"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
