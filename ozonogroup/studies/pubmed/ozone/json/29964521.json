In this process, coagulation and ozonation could synchronize within a single unit. Compared with the pre-ozonation-coagulation process and traditional coagulation process at the same coagulants dosage, the HOC process exhibited higher treatment efficiency, especially better organic matter removal performance at each pH value, which were 37.96% and 39.66%, respectively. In order to obtain the removal mechanism of dissolved organic matters by HOC process,ozone decomposition at two pH values either with or without AlCl<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O was monitored in this study. The results showed that higher pH and the addition of coagulant could accelerate ozone decay. In addition, <i>para</i>-chlorobenzoic acid (<i>p</i>-CBA) was chosen as the hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) probe compound to indirectly calculate the \u00b7OH exposure. The results revealed that the HOC process was involved in \u00b7OH reaction and coagulant could promote ozone decomposition due to its enhancing effect on \u00b7OH production during the ozonation process. Furthermore, the ozone depletion occurred more quickly at high pH due to its reaction with hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>), leading to the formation of \u00b7OH through a series of chain reactions. Moreover, the effects of <i>tert</i>-butanol, a well-known \u00b7OH inhibitor on ozone decay and <i>p</i>-CBA decomposition were also investigated. The results indicated that ozone depletion and <i>p</i>-CBA decomposition were significantly inhibited by <i>tert</i>-butanol, which further proved that ozone was decomposed into \u00b7OH radicals through chain reactions. In the HOC process, Al-based coagulants and hydrolyzed products could act as catalysts to enhance ozone decomposition into \u00b7OH which is a powerful oxidant to improve the organics removal efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Peng-Kang", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Chang", "Initials": "XC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964521", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201607195"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
