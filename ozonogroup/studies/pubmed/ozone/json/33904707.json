Nitrification in the activated sludge process (ASP) is an important N<sub>2</sub>O emission source. This study demonstrated that a short-term low dissolved oxygen (DO) increased the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by six times, while long-term low DO operation decreased the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by 54% (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Under long-term low DO, the ammonia oxidizer abundance in the ASP increased significantly, and thus, complete nitrification was recovered and no NH<sub>3</sub> or nitrite accumulated. Moreover, long-term low DO decreased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) by 28%, while increased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) by 507%, mainly due to their higher oxygen affinity. As a result, AOA outnumbered AOB with the AOA/AOB <i>amoA</i> gene ratio increasing to 19.5 under long-term low DO. The efficient nitrification and decreased AOB abundance might not increase N<sub>2</sub>O production via AOB under long-term low DO conditions. The enriched AOA could decrease the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions because they were reported to lack canonical nitric oxide (NO) reductase genes that convert NO to N<sub>2</sub>O. Probably because of AOA enrichment, the positive and significant (<i>P</i> = 0.02) correlation of N<sub>2</sub>O emission and nitrite concentration became insignificant (<i>P</i> = 0.332) after 80 days of low DO operation. Therefore, ASPs can be operated with low DO and extended sludge age to synchronously reduce N<sub>2</sub>O production and carbon dioxide emissions owing to lower aeration energy without compromising the nitrification efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8212-6875"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Water Treatment Processes and Materials and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Guoqiang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Water Treatment Processes and Materials and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xianwei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Water Treatment Processes and Materials and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Deyong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Water Treatment Processes and Materials and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Lugao", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Water Treatment Processes and Materials and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ju", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Water Treatment Processes and Materials and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Zhuang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Archaea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33904707", "10.1021/acs.est.0c07279"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
