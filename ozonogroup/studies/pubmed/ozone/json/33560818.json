X-ray diffraction of ALD-grown gold on silicon, silica, sapphire, and mica reveals consistent out-of-plane oriented crystalline film growth as well as epitaxially directed in-plane orientation on closely lattice-matched mica at a relatively low growth temperature of 180 \u00b0C. A more complete understanding of ALD gold nucleation, surface chemistry, and epitaxy will inform the next generation of low-temperature, nanoscale, textured depositions that are applicable to high surface area supports."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2032-0979"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Illinois Institute of Technology, 3101 S Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60616, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Material Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Avenue, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Pengfei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Illinois Institute of Technology, 3101 S Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60616, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuchen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2145-5034"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Avenue, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Cong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, 2220 Campus Drive, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}], "LastName": "Emery", "ForeName": "Jonathan D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, 2220 Campus Drive, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Anusheela", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1026-4558"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, 2220 Campus Drive, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2220 Campus Drive, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}], "LastName": "Bedzyk", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1440-1473"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Illinois Institute of Technology, 3101 S Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60616, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Avenue, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Hock", "ForeName": "Adam S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3916-1672"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Material Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Avenue, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Martinson", "ForeName": "Alex B F", "Initials": "ABF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33560818", "10.1021/acsami.0c17943"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
