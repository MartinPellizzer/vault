Epidemiological evidence, however, is inconsistent.", "Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2011-2015), we conducted a nationwide cohort study of 7424 adults. We measured overweight/obesity according to body mass index. We used annual average ground-level air pollutants, including ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), to demonstrate air pollution levels. We used the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure greenness exposure. We used time-varying Cox proportional hazard regression models to analyze the connections among air pollution, greenness, and the development of overweight/obesity in middle-aged and older adults in China. We also conducted mediation analyses to examine the mediating effects of air pollution.", "We found that lower risk of overweight/obesity was associated with more greenness exposure and lower levels of air pollution. We identified that an interquartile increment in NDVI was correlated with a lower hazard ratio (HR) of becoming overweight or obese (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.806, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.754-0.862). Although a 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> was correlated with higher risks (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.049, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.022-1.075, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.376, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.264-1.499). Effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on being overweight or obese were stronger in men than in women. According to the mediation analysis, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> mediated 8.85% and 19.22% of the association between greenness and being overweight or obese.", "An increased risk of being overweight or obese in middle-aged and older adults in China was associated with long-term exposure to higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. This risk was reduced through NDVI exposure, and the associations were partially mediated by air pollutants. To verify these findings, fine-scale studies are needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
