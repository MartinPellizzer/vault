Among various technologies, catalytic oxidation is considered a promising method for the post-treatment of VOCs. Researchers are sparing no effort to develop novel catalysts to meet the requirements of the catalytic process. Compared with the powdered or granular catalysts, the monolithic catalysts have the advantages of low pressure drop, high utilization of active phases, and excellent mechanical properties. This review summarized the new design of monolithic catalysts (including new preparation methods, new supports, and new energy supply methods) for the post-treatment of VOCs. It addressed the advantages of the new designs in detail, and the scope of applicability for each new monolithic catalyst was also highlighted. Finally, the highly required future development trends of monolithic catalysts for VOCs catalytic oxidation are recommended. We expect this work can inspire and guide researchers from both academic and industrial communities, and help pave the way for breakthroughs in fundamental research and industrial applications in this field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
