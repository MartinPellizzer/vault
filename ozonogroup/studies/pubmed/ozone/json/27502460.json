Results showed that the total organic carbon (TOC) removal increased significantly from 27\u00a0% (sole-ozonation) to 79.8\u00a0% (FMSO catalytic ozonation). The presence of FMSO in the ozonation process effectively enhanced the ozone utilization efficiency and accelerated the transformation of ozone into hydroxyl radicals. The latter result was verified by the indirect method, using NaHSO<sub>3</sub> as the reductor, and the direct electron spin resonance (ESR) determination technology. The adsorption of SMX on FMSO was minimal (1.8\u00a0%). However, ozone rapidly converted SMX into various intermediates, which was exhibited by the much higher adsorption affinity on the surface of FMSO than that of SMX. The accumulation of various intermediates on the FMSO surface also increased their contact probability with the \u00b7OH radicals generated by the ozone decomposition. The continuous interaction of intermediates with \u00b7OH radicals could further promote the benign cycling of the release of adsorption sites and the succeeding adsorption/decomposition of ozone and intermediates on FMSO. This could be another reason for the higher and faster TOC removal rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal & Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Guoying", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal & Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal & Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, China. shenjimin@hit.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jimin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal & Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, China. zhonglinchen@hit.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhonglin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "iron-manganese silicate oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JE42381TNV", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethoxazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2009 Aug 30;168(1):246-52", "ArticleIdList": ["19272699"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1978 Jul 14;83(1):69-74", "ArticleIdList": ["212052"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2003 Mar 1;37(5):1016-24", "ArticleIdList": ["12666935"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2014 Jun 15;274:258-69", "ArticleIdList": ["24793298"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2010 Apr 15;44(8):3116-22", "ArticleIdList": ["20201519"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2007 Mar;41(5):1013-21", "ArticleIdList": ["16934312"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicology. 1995 Jan 6;95(1-3):141-6", "ArticleIdList": ["7825180"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2002 Sep;48(10):1047-60", "ArticleIdList": ["12227510"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2007 Jan 1;372(2-3):361-71", "ArticleIdList": ["17126383"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2008 Feb 11;150(3):790-4", "ArticleIdList": ["17573190"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2015 Apr 9;286:276-84", "ArticleIdList": ["25590821"]}, {"Citation": "Ann Intern Med. 1984 Apr;100(4):495-9", "ArticleIdList": ["6230976"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27502460", "10.1007/s11356-016-7376-8", "10.1007/s11356-016-7376-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
