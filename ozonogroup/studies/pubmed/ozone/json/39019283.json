While the ecological project brings benefits to regional carbon assimilation, it also affects surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution level through perturbations in biogenic emissions and dry deposition. Here, we use a coupled chemistry-vegetation model to assess the impacts of land use and land cover change (LULCC) on summertime surface O<sub>3</sub> in China during 2000-2019. The LULCC is found to enhance O<sub>3</sub> by 1-2 ppbv in already-polluted areas. In contrast, moderate reductions of -0.4 to -0.8 ppbv are predicted in southern China where the largest forest cover changes locate. Such inconsistency is attributed to the background chemical regimes with positive O<sub>3</sub> changes over VOC-limited regions but negative changes in NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regions. The net contribution of LULCC to O<sub>3</sub> budget in China is 24.17 Kg/s, in which the positive contribution by more isoprene emissions almost triples the negative effects by the increased dry deposition. Although the LULCC-induced O<sub>3</sub> perturbation is much lower than the effects of anthropogenic emissions, forest expansion has exacerbated regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution in North China Plain and is expected to further enhance surface O<sub>3</sub> with continuous forestation in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
