In this study, four kinds of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts with a controllable microstructure were prepared to catalyze the direct NOR of N<sub>2</sub> in the air. At the same time, the reaction mechanism of the conversion of N<sub>2</sub> to nitric acid under catalytic ozonation was explored through experimental research and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The results showed that the prepared porous nanosheets self-assembled into microflower-structured samples. The HCOF showed extraordinary catalytic performance for direct NOR to produce a high concentration of nitric acid. The maximum rate of nitric acid formation could be as high as 6.67 mmol/(h\u00b7g<sub>cat</sub>), which was higher than those of most reported photocatalytic or electrocatalytic N<sub>2</sub> fixation processes for direct NOR to produce NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Furthermore, the <sup>15</sup>N isotopic-labeling experiment confirmed that the produced NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> originated from N<sub>2</sub> in the air by the direct NOR process. In the direct NOR mechanism, inert N<sub>2</sub> molecules were captured at the Co<sup>3+</sup> active sites by the acceptance-donation electron conduction mode, and the oxygen vacancies boosted the chemical adsorption of N<sub>2</sub> molecules and greatly reduced the activation energy barrier of N<sub>2</sub> molecules. The active free radicals <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and <sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generated by the decomposition of O<sub>3</sub> molecules oxidized N<sub>2</sub> to the intermediate *NO, which was the rate-determining step, and it was then absorbed by water to form nitric acid. The air catalytic ozonation method in this study was proposed as a facile pathway for efficient nitrogen fixation. This research provides a new method for environmental protection and efficient production of nitric acid at distributed sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0000-8831-209X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, P.
