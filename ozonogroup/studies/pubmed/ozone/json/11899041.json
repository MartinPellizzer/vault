Direct ozone sparging of seeds in water was used as an alternative mode of ozone treatment. Ozone-sparged seeds were also subsequently exposed to heat treatment at 40, 50, and 60 degrees C for 3 h. Populations of E. coli O157:H7 on untreated and treated seeds were determined by spread plating diluted samples on tryptic soy agar supplemented with 50 microg/ml of nalidixic acid. Since E. coli O157:H7 was released from inoculated seeds during treatment with ozone, the rate of release of cells from inoculated seeds soaked in 0.1% peptone water for up to 64 min was also determined. The overall reduction of E. coli O157:H7 on seeds treated with ozonated water without continuous sparging ranged from 0.40 to 1.75 log10 CFU/g (59.6 to 98.2%), whereas reductions for control seeds were 0.32 to 1.03 log10 CFU/g (51.7 to 90.5%). Treatment with higher ozone concentrations enhanced inactivation, but contact time longer than 8 min did not result in significantly higher reductions (P > 0.05). For seeds treated by ozone sparging, a 1.12-log10 CFU/g (92.1%) reduction was achieved using a 2-min contact time, and a 2.21-log10 CFU/g (99.4%) reduction was achieved with a 64-min contact time. The corresponding reductions for control seeds were 0.71 log10 CFU/g (79.5%) and 2.21 log10 CFU/g (99.4%), respectively. Treatment of ozone-sparged seeds at 60 degrees C for 3 h reduced the population to an undetectable level by direct plating (4 to 4.8 log10 CFU/g), although survivors were detected by enrichment. Ozone did not have a detrimental effect on seed germination percentage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ratna R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demirci", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beuchat", "ForeName": "Larry R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fett", "ForeName": "William F", "Initials": "WF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Medicago sativa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11899041", "10.4315/0362-028x-65.3.447", "S0362-028X(22)04858-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
