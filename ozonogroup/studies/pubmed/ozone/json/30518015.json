Both the rapid filters and BAC filters were dominated by <i>Rhizobiales</i> within <i>\u03b1-proteobacteria</i>, but other abundant orders and genera were significantly different in both types of filter. <i>Firmicutes</i> were abundant only in the intermediate chlorinated rapid filter, while <i>Acidobacteria</i> were abundant only in the BAC filters. Bacterial communities in the rapid filter showed high utilization of carbohydrates, while those in the BAC filters showed high utilization of polymers and carboxylic acids. These different characteristics of the bacterial communities could be related to the different substrates in the influents, filling materials, and residual disinfectants. Chlorination and ozonation inactivated the existing bacteria in the influent and formed different bacterial communities, which could be resistant to the oxidants and effectively utilize different substrates produced by the oxidant, including <i>Phreatobacter</i> in the rapid filters and <i>Hyphomicrobium</i> in the BAC filters. <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> and <i>Leptothrix</i>, which could utilize compounds adsorbed on the GAC, were abundant in the BAC filters. Ozonation increased taxonomic diversity but decreased functional diversity of the bacterial communities in the BAC filters. This study provides some new insights into the effects of oxidation processes and filling materials on the bacterial community structure in the biological filters of drinking water treatment plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seoul Water Institute, Seoul 04981, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yonkyu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seoul Water Institute, Seoul 04981, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cha", "ForeName": "Yeongseop", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seoul Water Institute, Seoul 04981, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Bogsoon", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9431852", "ISSNLinking": "1017-7825"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Consortia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30518015", "10.4014/jmb.1808.07068", "10.4014/jmb.1808.07068"]}}]}
