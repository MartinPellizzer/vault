However, it cannot be overlooked that the solid residue generated from this process can still pose environmental risks and impose economic pressure on society. To mitigate and recycle the solid residue, this study utilized it as a primary raw material for manufacturing ceramsite with potential applications in wastewater treatment. The optimal ratio of solid residue to fly ash was demonstrated to be 6:4 with an additional 15% of clay supplementing the raw ceramsite materials. Furthermore, the optimal sintering process was established as preheating at 300\u00a0\u00b0C for 25\u00a0min followed by sintering at 1085\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, as determined through an L16 (4<sup>4</sup>) Orthogonal test. The prepared ceramsite demonstrated advantageous performance parameters that exceeded the standards outlined in the Chinese industry standard CJ/T 299-2008 for water treatment artificial ceramsite. When utilized in an ozonation system, the ceramsite exhibited remarkable catalytic activity for phenol degradation by promoting the decomposition of molecular O<sub>3</sub> into hydroxyl radicals. Additionally, it displayed minimal leaching of heavy metals and lower application costs. These findings emphasize its attractiveness in water and wastewater treatment processes and present a practical strategy for reclaiming this solid residue."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
