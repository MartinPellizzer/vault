The objective of this study was to explore the association in 14 Chinese cities using a time-stratified case-crossover design. We identified 80,787 hospital admissions for AMI between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 from electronic hospitalization summary reports. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the percent changes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in AMI admissions in relation to an interquartile range increase in ambient air pollutant concentrations. All analyzed air pollutants, with the exception of ozone, were positively associated with daily AMI admissions on lag2 and lag3 days. An interquartile range increase in particulate matter <10\u2009\u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide concentrations on lag2 day was significantly associated with a 0.8% (95% CI 0.1%, 1.6%), 2.0% (95% CI 1.2%, 2.9%), 2.2% (95% CI 1.4%, 3.1%), and 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%, 1.8%) increase in AMI admissions, respectively. We also observed a significant association in relation to ozone on lag4 day (percent change: 1.3%; 95% CI 0.2%, 2.4%). Subgroup analyses indicated no effect modification of risk by age (\u226565 years and <65 years) or gender. In conclusion, this is the first multicity study in China, or even in other developing countries, to report the short-term effects of air pollution on AMI morbidity. Our findings contribute to the limited scientific data on the effects of ambient air pollution on AMI in developing countries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
