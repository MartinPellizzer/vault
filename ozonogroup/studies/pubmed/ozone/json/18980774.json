Wide diversity of natural waters has been subjected to reactions with various amounts of ClO(2). For comparison examined waters have also been treated with ozone and chlorine. The application of chlorine dioxide and ozone significantly changed the molecular weight distribution of aquatic organic matter. As a result significant amounts of biodegradable carboxylic acids and aldehydes were generated. The formic, acetic, oxalic and ketomalonic acids as well as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal were identified. The productivity of aldehydes calculated for all examined waters and disinfectants amounted 12.7-47.7microgmg(-1) DOC in the case of ozonation, 1.3-8.1microgmg(-1) DOC after chlorination and 1.7-9.4microgmg(-1) DOC for ClO(2) treatment. The highest total concentration of carboxylic acids was determined after the ozonation processes. In this case the organic acids' formation potential was in the range 10.8-62.8microgmg(-1) DOC. Relatively high formation potential (5.3-17.9microgmg(-1) DOC) was determined after the oxidation with ClO(2) as well. In the case of chlorination, the productivity of organic acids was low and did not exceed 3.4microgmg(-1) DOC. The relatively high correlation between BDOC formation and carboxylic acids' formation potential was observed. Thus, carboxylic acids' formation potential may be used as a measure of water potential to form BDOC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Water Treatment Technology, Adam Mickiewicz University, Drzyma\u0142y 24, 60-613 Pozna\u0144, Poland. askas@amu.edu.pl <askas@amu.edu.pl>"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Swietlik", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raczyk-Stanis\u0142awiak", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nawrocki", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8061YMS4RM", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorine dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18980774", "10.1016/j.watres.2008.10.021", "S0043-1354(08)00472-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
