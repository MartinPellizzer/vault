The catalyst properties were analyzed by proximate, ultimate, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, Fourier-transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. In addition, hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction experiments were conducted to analyze the catalyst properties. The specific area and formation of micropores of SDC were improved by applying KOH treatment. MnOx/SDC-K3 exhibited a higher toluene removal efficiency of 89.7% after 100\u00a0min than MnOx supported on activated carbon (MnOx/AC) with a removal efficiency of 6.6%. The higher (O<sub>ads</sub> (adsorbed oxygen)+O<sub>v</sub>(vacancy oxygen))/O<sub>L</sub> (lattice oxygen) and Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>4+</sup> ratios of MnOx/SDC-K3 than those of MnOx/AC seemed to be important for the catalytic oxidation of toluene."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
