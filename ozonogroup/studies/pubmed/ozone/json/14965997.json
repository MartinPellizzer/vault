Because it has been suggested that changes in air quality are responsible for the decline, we examined the effects of acidic mists and ozone on several biochemical and growth parameters in mature montane red spruce. We used branch-sized environmental chambers to introduce mists of controlled composition and exclude ambient clouds and ozone from individual branches within a tree. Mists consisting of distilled water increased the end-of-season pigment concentration and shoot length of enclosed branches relative to ambient or artificial mists. Needle and twig weights and starch concentrations were not significantly altered by the acidic mist treatments. Removal of ambient ozone had no apparent effect on the variables measured."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6018, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vann", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Strimbeck", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14965997", "10.1093/treephys/15.10.639"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
