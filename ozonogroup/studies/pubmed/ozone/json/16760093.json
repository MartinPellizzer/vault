Using a range of different dosage of coagulant, the breakage of flocs was followed at a high stirring speed, corresponding to average shear rate (G) of about 518 s(-1). Most of the breakage occurred within a few seconds of increasing the shear rate. After breakage the stirring rate was reduced to the original value of 50 rpm (G approximately equals 23 s(-1)) to allow the flocs to re-grow. It was found that only limited re-growth of flocs occurred indicating irreversibility of the floc breakup process. For preozonated samples, the re-growth of flocs occurred to a much greater extent with lower residual turbidity. The findings show that the use of preozonation (1.25 and 1.50 mg/L) provides beneficial results to both improve turbidity removal and reduce coagulant requirement. Furthermore, better re-formation of flocs is achievable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Marmara University, Goztepe, Istanbul, Turkey. yukselen@eng.marmara.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yukselen", "ForeName": "Mehmet Ali", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Halloran", "ForeName": "Kelvin", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gregory", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3HWS7HF5XD", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diatoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16760093", "10.1080/10934520600623067", "HX3HV742M6560M42"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
