Abundant reports have explored the damage mechanisms of O<sub>3</sub> on soybean. However, how the elevated O<sub>3</sub> affects metabolite profiling of soybean remains to be poorly understood. Here, we compare the metabolic profile of soybean leaves under charcoal filtered air (CF, <20 ppb) and short-term elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentration (EO, 100 ppb). High level of O<sub>3</sub> affects metabolites for the tricarbonic acid (TCA) cycle, reactive oxygen species, cell wall composition and amino acids. Significantly, jasmonic acid-related metabolite promoting stomata closure is highly induced with 125-fold change. Furthermore, O<sub>3</sub> fumigation alters the expression of genes contributing to the biosynthesis of certain metabolites in TCA cycle. Together, these findings identify a wide range of changed metabolites in response to O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Our results pave the way for the genetic improvement of soybean to adapt to O<sub>3</sub> pollution to maintain stable yields."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
