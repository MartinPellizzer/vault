However, the addition of H2O2 will change the oxidation pathways of organic compounds due to the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals, which could affect the removal efficacy of trihalomethane precursors via the combination of ozone and biological activated carbon (O3-BAC). In this study, we evaluated the effects of H2O2 addition on bromate formation and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) reduction during treatment of bromide-containing (97.6-129.1 microg/L) source water by the O3-BAC process. At an ozone dose of 4.2 mg/L, an H2O2/O3 (g/g) ratio of over 1.0 was required to maintain the bromate concentration below 10.0 microg/L, while a much lower H2O2/O3 ratio was sufficient for a lower ozone dose. An H2O2/O3 (g/g) ratio below 0.3 should be avoided since the bromate concentration will increase with increasing H2O2 dose below this ratio. However, the addition of H202 at an ozone dose of 3.2 mg/L and an H2O2/O3 ratio of 1.0 resulted in a 43% decrease in THMFP removal when comparedwith the O3-BAC process. The optimum H2O2/O3 (g/g) ratio for balancing bromate and trihalomethane control was about 0.7-1.0. Fractionation of organic materials showed that the addition of H2O2 decreased the removal efficacy of the hydrophilic matter fraction of DOC by ozonation and increased the reactivity of the hydrophobic fractions during formation of trihalomethane, which may be the two main reasons responsible for the decrease in THMFP reduction efficacy. Overall, this study clearly demonstrated that it is necessary to balance bromate reduction and THMFP control when adopting an H2O2 addition strategy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China. wild.trees@163.com"}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yongjing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jianwei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhengzhou Water Supply Investment Holdings Co.
