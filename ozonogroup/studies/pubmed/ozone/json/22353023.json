Naphthalene and ozone exhibit a strong preference to be adsorbed at the surfactant-coated air/ice interfaces, as opposed to either being dissolved into the bulk of the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) or being incorporated into the ice crystals. The QLL becomes thinner when the air/ice interface is coated with surfactant molecules. The adsorption of both naphthalene and ozone onto surfactant-coated air/ice interfaces is enhanced when compared to bare air/ice interface. Both naphthalene and ozone tend to stay dissolved in the surfactant layer and close to the QLL, rather than adsorbing on top of the surfactant molecules and close to the air region of our systems. Surfactants prefer to orient at a tilted angle with respect to the air/ice interface; the angular distribution and the most preferred angle vary depending on the hydrophilic end group, the length of the hydrophobic tail, and the surfactant concentration at the air/ice interface. Naphthalene prefers to have a flat orientation on the surfactant coated air/ice interface, except at high concentrations of 1-hexadecanol at the air/ice interface; the angular distribution of naphthalene depends on the specific surfactant and its concentration at the air/ice interface. The dynamics of naphthalene molecules at the surfactant-coated air/ice interface slow down as compared to those observed at bare air/ice interfaces. The presence of surfactants does not seem to affect the self-association of naphthalene molecules at the air/ice interface, at least for the specific surfactants and the range of concentrations considered in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cain Department of Chemical Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liyana-Arachchi", "ForeName": "Thilanga P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valsaraj", "ForeName": "Kalliat T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "Francisco R", "Initials": "FR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ice"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2166IN72UN", "NameOfSubstance": "naphthalene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22353023", "10.1021/jp3002417"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
