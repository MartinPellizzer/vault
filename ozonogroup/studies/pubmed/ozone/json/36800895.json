Introducing combustion promoters as additives in NH<sub>3</sub>-based fuel can be a feasible solution. In this work, the oxidation of ammonia by adding different reactivity promoters, i.e., hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), was investigated in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at temperatures between 700 and 1200 K and at a pressure of 1 bar. The effect of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was also studied, starting from an extremely low temperature (450 K). Species mole fraction profiles as a function of the temperature were measured by molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). With the help of the promoters, NH<sub>3</sub> consumption can be triggered at lower temperatures than in the neat NH<sub>3</sub> case. CH<sub>3</sub>OH has the most prominent effect on enhancing the reactivity, followed by H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Furthermore, two-stage NH<sub>3</sub> consumption was observed in NH<sub>3</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub>OH blends, whereas no such phenomenon was found by adding H<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub>. The mechanism constructed in this work can reasonably reproduce the promoting effect of the additives on NH<sub>3</sub> oxidation. The cyanide chemistry is validated by the measurement of HCN and HNCO. The reaction CH<sub>2</sub>O + NH<sub>2</sub> \u21c4 HCO + NH<sub>3</sub> is responsible for the underestimation of CH<sub>2</sub>O in NH<sub>3</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> fuel blends. The discrepancies observed in the modeling of NH<sub>3</sub> fuel blends are mainly due to the deviations in the neat NH<sub>3</sub> case. The total rate coefficient and the branching ratio of NH<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub> are still controversial. The high branching fraction of the chain-propagating channel NH<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub> \u21c4 H<sub>2</sub>NO + OH improves the model performance under low-pressure JSR conditions for neat NH<sub>3</sub> but overestimates the reactivity for NH<sub>3</sub> fuel blends. Based on this mechanism, the reaction pathway and rate of production analyses were conducted. The HONO-related reaction routine was found to be activated uniquely by adding CH<sub>3</sub>OH, which enhances the reactivity most significantly. It was observed from the experiment that adding ozone to the oxidant can effectively initiate NH<sub>3</sub> consumption at temperatures below 450 K but unexpectedly inhibit the NH<sub>3</sub> consumption at temperatures higher than 900 K. The preliminary mechanism reveals that adding the elementary reactions between NH<sub>3</sub>-related species and O<sub>3</sub> is effective for improving the model performance, but their rate coefficients have to be refined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, 38116 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xiaoyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4555-2074"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, 38116 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mengdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, 38116 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, 38116 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Fernandes", "ForeName": "Ravi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9254-216X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, 38116 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Moshammer", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36800895", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07547"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
