Herein, novel copper oxide (CuO<sub>x</sub>) catalysts supported on defect-rich mesoporous alumina microspheres are developed using a spray-drying-assisted evaporation induced self-assembly method. The catalysts possess a special structure composed of a mesoporous outer layer, a mesoporous-nanosphere-stacked under layer and a hollow cavity. Because of this special structure and the defective nature of the alumina support, the CuO<sub>x</sub> catalysts are ultrasmall in size (1\u00a0~\u00a03\u00a0nm), bivalent with a very high Cu<sup>+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> ratio (0.7), and highly stable against sintering and oxidation at high temperatures (up to 800\u00a0\u00b0C), while the wet impregnation method results in CuO<sub>x</sub> catalysts with much larger sizes (~15\u00a0nm) and lower the Cu<sup>+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> ratios (~0.29). The catalyst formation mechanism through the spray drying method is proposed and discussed. The catalysts show remarkable performance in catalytic ozonation of phenol wastewaters. With high-concentration phenol (250\u00a0ppm) as the model organic pollutant, the optimized catalyst delivers promising catalytic performance with 100% phenol removal and 53% TOC removal in 60\u00a0min, and a high cyclic stability. Superoxide anion free radicals (\u22c5O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) and hydroxyl radicals (\u22c5OH) are the predominant reactive species. A detailed structure-performance study reveals the surface hydroxyl groups and Cu<sup>+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> redox couples play cooperatively to accelerate O<sub>3</sub> decomposition generating reactive radicals. The plausible catalytic O<sub>3</sub> decomposition mechanism is proposed and discussed with supportive evidences."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
