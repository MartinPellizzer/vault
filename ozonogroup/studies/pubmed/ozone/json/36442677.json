The outcomes were used to produce an ecological risk assessment model to predict the extra risk of adverse outcomes based on the concentration of ozonated residuals. A test soil with low organic matter (0.5% w/w) was mixed with raw crude oil, artificially weathered, and treated at three doses of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) gas (5\u00a0g, 10\u00a0g, and 40\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub> per 600\u00a0g of soil). Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and produced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured. TREATMENT categories (control, petroleum, petroleum\u00a0+\u00a05\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>, petroleum\u00a0+\u00a010\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>, and petroleum\u00a0+\u00a040\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>) were then used to create a dilution series using different proportions of the test soil and a commercially available potting mix (\u223c75% w/w organic matter) to evaluate the effects of background organic matter (b-ORGANIC) in conjunction with TPH and DOC. Multivariable logistic regression was performed on the adverse germination outcome as a function of TPH, DOC, TREATMENT, and b-ORGANIC. The parameters controlling germination were the continuous variable DOC and the categorical variables TREATMENT and b-ORGANIC. Radish germination was strongly harmed by DOC from ozonation, but DOC's ecotoxicity decreased with increasing O<sub>3</sub> dose and the presence of b-ORGANIC beyond 10% (w/w). We used the germination outcome of radish to produce a logistic regression model that computes margins of DOC (\u00b1 std. error) that create 10%, 25%, and 50% extra risk of adverse germination effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
