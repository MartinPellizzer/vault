This study was based on the observation that upper facial stratum corneum contained significantly higher levels of the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol than corresponding layers of arm stratum corneum. We hypothesized that the underlying mechanism involves sebaceous gland secretion of vitamin E. To test this, we examined in eight human volunteers: (i) stratum corneum levels and distribution profiles of vitamin E in sites with a different sebaceous gland density (arm versus cheek); (ii) whether vitamin E is a significant constituent of human sebum; and (iii) if there is a correlation between levels of vitamin E and squalene, a marker of sebum secretion, in skin surface lipids. Using standardized techniques for stratum corneum tape stripping and sebum collection, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of tocopherols and squalene, we found that: (i) the ratio of cheek versus upper arm alpha-tocopherol levels was 20 : 1 for the upper stratum corneum and decreased gradually with stratum corneum depth; (ii) vitamin E (alpha- and gamma-tocopherol forms) is a significant constituent of human sebum and is continuously secreted at cheek and forehead sites during a test period of 135 min; and (iii) vitamin E correlates well with levels of cosecreted squalene (r2 = 0.86, p < 0.001). In conclusion, sebaceous gland secretion is a relevant physiologic pathway for the delivery of vitamin E to upper layers of facial skin. This mechanism may serve to protect skin surface lipids and the upper stratum corneum from harmful oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Freidrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thiele", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weber", "ForeName": "S U", "Initials": "SU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Packer", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0426720", "ISSNLinking": "0022-202X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sebaceous Glands"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10594744", "10.1046/j.1523-1747.1999.00794.x", "S0022-202X(15)40690-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
