The impact of the oxygen precursor on the structural properties of the films and their moisture-barrier performance is investigated. The O<sub>3</sub>-AlO<sub><i>x</i></sub>films, followed by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-AlO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, exhibit higher refractive indexes, lower concentrations of OH- groups, and lower water-vapor-transmission rates compared to the films deposited using water (H<sub>2</sub>O-AlO<sub><i>x</i></sub>). The AlO<sub><i>x</i></sub>films are then rapidly deposited as thin-film-encapsulation layers on perovskite solar cells at 130 \u00b0C without damaging the temperature-sensitive perovskite and organic materials. The stability of the<i>p-i-n</i>formamidinium methylammonium lead iodide solar cells under standard ISOS-D-3 testing conditions (65 \u00b0C and 85% relative humidity) is significantly enhanced by the encapsulation layers. Specifically, the O<sub>3</sub>-AlO<sub><i>x</i></sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-AlO<sub><i>x</i></sub>layers result in a six-fold increase in the time required for the cells to degrade to 80% of their original efficiency compared to un-encapsulated cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Creative Commons Attribution license."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Asgarimoghaddam", "ForeName": "Hatameh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Advanced Optoelectronic Materials, Suzhou Key Laboratory of Novel Semiconductor Materials and Devices, Suzhou Key Laboratory of Macromolecular Design and Precision Synthesis, College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qiaoyun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Shahin", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Advanced Optoelectronic Materials, Suzhou Key Laboratory of Novel Semiconductor Materials and Devices, Suzhou Key Laboratory of Macromolecular Design and Precision Synthesis, College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9752-0015"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, Waterloo N2L 3G1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Musselman", "ForeName": "Kevin P", "Initials": "KP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38016447", "10.1088/1361-6528/ad1059"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
