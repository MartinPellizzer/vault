The uptake rate of these compounds by leaves of three different Quercus species, Q. acutissima, Q. myrsinaefolia, and Q. phillyraeoides, at typical concentrations within a forest (several part per billion by volume) were determined. The rates of uptake of croton aldehyde (CA) and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) were also investigated for comparison. The rates of uptake of the two aldehydes MACR and CA were found to be higher than those of the two ketones. In particular, the rate of MEK uptake for Q. myrsinaefolia was exceptionally low. The ratio of intercellular to fumigated concentrations, Ci/Ca, for MACR and CA was found to be low (0-0.24), while the ratio for the two ketones was 0.22-0.90. To evaluate the contribution of tree uptake as a sink for the two isoprene-oxygenates within the forest canopy, loss rates of the compounds due to uptake by trees and by reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH radicals) and O(3) were calculated. The loss rate by tree uptake was the highest, followed by the reaction with OH radicals, even at a high OH concentration (0.15 pptv) both for MACR and MVK, suggesting that tree uptake provides a significant sink."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan. atani@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tani", "ForeName": "Akira", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tobe", "ForeName": "Seita", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimizu", "ForeName": "Sachie", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butadienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0A62964IBU", "NameOfSubstance": "isoprene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7864XYD3JJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrolein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9HRB24892H", "NameOfSubstance": "methacrylaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AR7642I1MP", "NameOfSubstance": "3-buten-2-one"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acrolein"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Butadienes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Quercus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20715865", "10.1021/es1017569"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
