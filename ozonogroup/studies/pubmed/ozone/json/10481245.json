Air samples in the two tunnels were collected using canisters. Analysis of VACs was conducted with a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer. The total VOCs concentrations in Zefun tunnel ranged from 483.5 to 1032.2 (micrograms/m3) which increased with the increase in traffic volume. In the Lishin tunnel, the total VACs concentration ranged from 356.6 to 1961.3 (micrograms/m3) which was not well correlated with the traffic volume. The most predominant VACs in these vehicle tunnels were toluene and xylenes. Although the traffic volume and types of vehicles were not exactly the same, the characteristic ratios of the VACs concentrations were found to be similar. These results indicated that the existence of a specific characteristic ratio of VAC concentration was affected by the mobile sources. The maximum ozone formation potential resulted from the vehicles in the Lishin motorcycle tunnel which had higher values than the Zefun tunnel and much higher than the SPECIATE databases in the US via weighting the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) scale."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Safety Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Touliu, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsieh", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kao", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10481245", "10.1016/s0045-6535(99)00045-4", "S0045653599000454"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
