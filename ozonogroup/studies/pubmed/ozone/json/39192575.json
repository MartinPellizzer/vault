This requires identifying and understanding a proxy that is well-correlated with ground-level ozone variation and available with spatiotemporal high-resolution data. This study introduces a high-resolution ozone modeling method utilizing the XGBoost algorithm with satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) as the primary predictor. Focusing on China in 2019, our model achieved a cross-validation <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> of 0.91 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 13.51 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. We provide detailed maps highlighting ground-level ozone concentrations in urban areas, uncovering spatial variations previously unresolved, along with time series aligning with established understandings of ozone dynamics. Our local interpretation of the machine learning model underscores the significant contribution of LST to spatiotemporal ozone variations, surpassing other meteorological, pollutant, and geographical predictors in its influence. Validation results indicate that model performance decreases as spatial resolution becomes coarser, with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> decreasing from 0.91 for the 1 km model to 0.85 for the 25 km model. The methodology and data sets generated by this study offer new insights into ground-level ozone variability and mapping and can significantly aid in exposure assessment and epidemiological research related to this critical environmental challenge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6712-0133"], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Qingqing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jingru", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3879-7962"], "LastName": "Saide", "ForeName": "Pablo E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Weihang", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39192575", "10.1021/acs.est.4c02926"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
