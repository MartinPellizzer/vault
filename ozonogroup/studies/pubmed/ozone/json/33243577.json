The MOF-derived Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite remained similar polyhedrons structure of ZIF-67, suggesting that Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was well-dispersed in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite. Furthermore, a larger amount of surface carbon-oxygen functional groups were distributed on Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite, which resulted in the diversification of active sites for catalytic ozonation reaction. NOF degradation and mineralization could be effectively enhanced in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C/O<sub>3</sub> process. Moreover, NOF mineralization by catalytic ozonation strongly depended on the solution pH, while other operational conditions, such as O<sub>3</sub> concentration and catalyst dosage had not obvious influence on it. Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite could significantly accelerate O<sub>3</sub> decomposition to produce active free radicals (such as \u2022OH), which enhanced the mineralization of NOF. The possible catalytic mechanism of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite was proposed. Additionally, after five consecutive use of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite in catalytic ozonation process, there was no obvious decrease in TOC removal efficiency, indicating a stable performance of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-C composite, which was suitable for the catalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
