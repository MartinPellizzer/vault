The ozone/UV process was compared to individual ozone and the UV processes and control parameters were total and fecal coliforms. Different ozone concentrations (6-12 mg O\u2083/min) and different UV fluencies (6.7-20.12 mJ/cm\u00b2) were tested. It is possible to conclude than none of the processes achieved the disinfection levels required to comply with the Mexican standard NOM-003-SEMARNAT-1997. The continuous ozone process offered the lower total and fecal coliforms reductions, while UV light resulted a disinfection agent with higher germicide power than ozone. The maximum logarithmic reduction achieved due to the combined ozone/UV process was of 2.04 for fecal coliforms and of 2.17 for total coliforms. The next 8 combinations showed lower removal efficiencies, but always higher than those obtained with the single ozone or UV processes. The ozone/UV process was highly effective for the disinfection and a synergistic effect was observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Energia, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bustos", "ForeName": "Yaneth A", "Initials": "YA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vaca", "ForeName": "Mabel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "Raymundo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torres", "ForeName": "Luis G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20924916", "10.1080/10934529.2010.513241", "927408460"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
