With the maximum concentration, acute skin toxicity test was applied on the intact and damaged skins of rats.Active cutaneous anaphylaxis was applied to the guinea pigs.\u2029 Results: High concentration (ozone consumption: 150 g/L) of medical ozone oil showed a slight irritation on the broken skin of guinea pigs, while low concentrations did not show skin irritation.Medical ozone oil had no obvious acute toxicity to rats. The medical ozone oil and base oil showed mildallergy for the skin of guinea pig.\u2029 Conclusion: The irritation of medical ozone oil is related to its concentration.
