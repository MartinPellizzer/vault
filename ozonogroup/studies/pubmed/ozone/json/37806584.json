Many previous studies have confirmed more rapid NO<sub>x</sub> reduction compared with VOCs might be responsible for the O<sub>3</sub> increase during this period, while the comprehensive impacts of each VOC species and NO<sub>x</sub> on ambient O<sub>3</sub> and their interactions with meteorology were not revealed clearly. To clarify the detailed reasons for the O<sub>3</sub> increase, a continuous campaign was performed in a typical industrial city of NCP. Meanwhile, the machine-learning technique and the box model were employed to reveal the mechanisms of O<sub>3</sub> increase from the perspective of meteorology and photochemical process, respectively. The result suggested that the ambient O<sub>3</sub> level in Tangshan increased from 18.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.63 to 45.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.52\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (143%) during COVID-19 lockdown, and the emission reduction and meteorology contributed to 54\u00a0% and 46\u00a0% of this increment, respectively. The lower wind speed (WS) coupled with regional transport played a significant role on O<sub>3</sub> increase (30.8\u00a0kg/s). The O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity verified that O<sub>3</sub> production was highly volatile organic compounds (VOC)-sensitive (Relative incremental reactivity (RIR): 0.75), while the NO<sub>x</sub> showed the negative impact on O<sub>3</sub> production in Tangshan (RIR: -0.59). It suggested that the control of VOCs rather than NO<sub>x</sub> might be more effective in reducing O<sub>3</sub> level in Tangshan because it was located on the VOC-limited regime. Besides, both of ozone formation potential (OFP) analysis and observation-based model (OBM) demonstrated that the alkenes (36.3\u00a0ppb) and anthropogenic oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) (15.2\u00a0ppb) showed the higher OFP compared with other species, and their reactions released a large number of HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> radicals. Moreover, the concentrations of these species did not experience marked decreases during COVID-19 lockdown, which were major contributors to O<sub>3</sub> increase during this period. This study also underlined the necessity of priority controlling alkenes and OVOCs across the NCP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
