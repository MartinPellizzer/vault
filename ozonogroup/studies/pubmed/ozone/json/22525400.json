While some progress has been made using cavity ring-down spectroscopy, these systems rely on complex and expensive lasers. Here we investigate an approach combining Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (CEAS) with an inexpensive low vapour pressure mercury lamp for sensitive absorption measurements at 253.7 nm. We demonstrate that the CEAS absorption in our system is 50 times greater than the absorption found in a single-pass configuration; using this approach, we obtained limits of detection of 8.1 pptv (66 ng m(-3)) for gaseous elemental mercury and 8.4 ppbv for ozone. We evaluate the performance of the system and discuss potential improvements and applications of this approach."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Environmental Research Institute, University College Cork, Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Darby", "ForeName": "Steven B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Paul D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venables", "ForeName": "Dean S", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Analyst", "NlmUniqueID": "0372652", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2654"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22525400", "10.1039/c2an35149h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
