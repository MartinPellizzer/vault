Teeth were divided into 2 main groups according to the method of ozone treatment. Each group was further subdivided equally into test and control subgroups. Following caries excavation, color, consistency and DIAGNOdent assessments of dentin were evaluated after 6 and 12 months.", "Regarding dentin color and consistency, no significant differences were observed following ozone application, with and without a remineralizing solution. There were no significant differences between ozone treatment, and calcium hydroxide during the different evaluation periods, except in group I cases after 6 months, concerning the dentin color. The DIAGNOdent values were significantly reduced following ozone application, with or without a remineralizing solution, as well as between test and control cases in group I after 6 months.", "Ozone application through the stepwise excavation had no significant effect on dentin color and consistency in young permanent molars.
