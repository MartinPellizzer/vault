Ozone (O3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydrogen polyoxides (H2Ox, x > 2), associated hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals (HOx = OH and HO2), and superoxide and ozonide anions (O2(-) and O3(-), respectively) are the primary oxidants in these systems. They are commonly classified as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Atmospheric chemistry is driven by a complex system of chain reactions of species, including nitrogen oxides, hydroxyl and hydroperoxide radicals, alkoxy and peroxy radicals, and ozone. HOx radicals contribute to keeping air clean, but in polluted areas, the ozone concentration increases and creates a negative impact on plants and animals. Indeed, ozone concentration is used to assess air quality worldwide. Clouds have a direct effect on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. On one hand, cloud droplets absorb many trace atmospheric gases, which can be scavenged by rain and fog. On the other hand, ionic species can form in this medium, which makes the chemistry of the atmosphere richer and more complex. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that air-cloud interfaces might have a significant impact on the overall chemistry of the troposphere. Despite the large differences in molecular composition, concentration, and thermodynamic conditions among atmospheric, environmental, and biological systems, the underlying chemistry involving ROS has many similarities. In this Account, we examine ROS and discuss the chemical characteristics common to all of these systems. In water treatment, ROS are key components of an important subset of advanced oxidation processes. Ozonation, peroxone chemistry, and Fenton reactions play important roles in generating sufficient amounts of hydroxyl radicals to purify wastewater. Biochemical processes within living organisms also involve ROS. These species can come from pollutants in the environment, but they can also originate endogenously, initiated by electron reduction of molecular oxygen. These molecules have important biological signaling activities, but they cause oxidative stress when dysfunction within the antioxidant system occurs. Excess ROS in living organisms can lead to problems, such as protein oxidation-through either cleavage of the polypeptide chain or modification of amino acid side chains-and lipid oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Departament de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f2gica i Modelitzaci\u00f3 Molecular, IQAC-CSIC, C/ Jordi Girona 18, 08034 Barcelona, Spain."}], "LastName": "Anglada", "ForeName": "Josep M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021SRSMC, University of Lorraine, BP 70239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7UMR 7565, CNRS, 54506 Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France."}], "LastName": "Martins-Costa", "ForeName": "Marilia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2225College of Arts and Sciences, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 1223 Oldfather Hall Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska 68588-0312, United States."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021SRSMC, University of Lorraine, BP 70239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7UMR 7565, CNRS, 54506 Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France."}], "LastName": "Ruiz-L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "Manuel F", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acc Chem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0157313", "ISSNLinking": "0001-4842"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25688469", "10.1021/ar500412p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
