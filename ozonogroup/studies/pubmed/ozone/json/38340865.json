Here we conducted real-time measurements of gaseous organic compounds using a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (Vocus PTR-MS) at the Shanghuang mountain site (1128\u00a0m\u00a0a.s.l.) in southeastern China during November 2022. Our results revealed a substantial impact of mixed biogenic and anthropogenic compounds at the mountain site, with oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) comprising 74\u00a0% of the organic vapors. Two distinct periods, characterized by sunny days (P1) and persistent cloud events (P2), were observed. P1 exhibited higher concentrations of biogenic-related emissions compared to P2. For instance, isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes during P1 were 2.4-2.9 times higher than those during P2. OVOCs such as acetaldehyde, MVK\u00a0+\u00a0MACR, acetone, and MEK also showed higher concentrations during P1, indicating a dominant source from the photochemical oxidation of biogenic VOCs. Anthropogenic-related VOCs like benzene and toluene had higher concentrations during P2, displaying different diurnal cycles compared to P1. Our analysis identified four biogenic-related factors dominated by isoprene and sesquiterpene oxidation products, and two anthropogenic-related factors. During P1, biogenic sources contributed approximately 80\u00a0% to total organic compounds, while during P2, anthropogenic sources, particularly the aromatic-related factor, increased from 16\u00a0% to 35\u00a0%. Furthermore, a unique factor characterized by C<sub>2</sub> amines and C<sub>3</sub> amides and periodic plumes indicated the influence of industrial emissions from regional transport. The study highlights the significant variations in sources and compositions of gaseous organic compounds at regional mountain sites due to changes in meteorology and photochemical processing, potentially impacting regional ozone and SOA formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
