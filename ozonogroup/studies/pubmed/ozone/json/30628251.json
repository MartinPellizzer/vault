The main progress included impacts of BVOCs categories, plant functional types, O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity of plants, the O<sub>3</sub> stress level on the response of BVOCs emissions to single O<sub>3</sub> stress, and the combined effects of elevated O<sub>3</sub> and temperature, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), drought, and nitrogen (N) deposition. Results indicated that most published results reported no change in BVOCs emissions in response to increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Specifically, decreasing effects of O<sub>3</sub> on BVOCs emissions were more obvious in studies on isoprene and deciduous species, whereas studies on monoterpenes and evergreen plant species showed more results with an increasing trend as well as acute O<sub>3</sub> exposure experiments. There was an increased tendency of monoterpene emissions to the combined effects of O<sub>3</sub> and temperature or N deposition. However, the combined effects of O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> decreased isoprene emissions. Given that studies on the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on BVOCs emissions remain scarce, more complete experiments are needed that consider differences between short-term and long-term or individual-level and ecosystem-level. Furthermore, future research should strengthen the multi-factor interactive studies, particularly on O<sub>3</sub> and other global change components and biotic and abiotic stresses, to assess BVOCs emissions from terrestrial ecosystems in response to O<sub>3</sub> pollution both currently and in the future, which will provide valuable theoretical support to air pollution control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xiang-Yang", "Initials": "XY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30628251", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201802075"]}}]}
