The California Air Resources Board recently adopted a rule requiring that by 2014 all in-use heavy trucks and buses meet current (2007) exhaust particulate matter (PM) emission standards. Also by 2023 all in-use heavy-duty vehicles will have to meet current NO(x) emission standards, with significant progress in achieving the requirements for NO(x) control expected by 2014. This will require retrofit or replacement of older in-use engines. Diesel particle filters (DPF) reduce PM emissions but may increase the NO(2)/NO(x) emission ratio to approximately 35%, compared to approximately 5% typical of diesel engines without particle filters. Additionally, DPF with high oxidative capacity reduce CO and hydrocarbon emissions. We evaluate the effects of retrofitting trucks with DPF on air quality in southern California, using an Eulerian photochemical air quality model. Compared to a 2014 reference scenario without the retrofit program, black carbon concentrations decreased by 12 +/- 2% and 14 +/- 2% during summer and fall, respectively, with corresponding increases in ambient ozone concentrations of 3 +/- 2% and 7 +/- 3%. NO(2) concentrations decreased by 2-4% overall despite the increase in primary NO(2) emissions because total NO(x) emissions were reduced as part of the program to retrofit NO(x) control systems on in-use engines. However, in some cases NO(2) concentrations may increase at locations with high diesel truck traffic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-1710, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Millstein", "ForeName": "Dev E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harley", "ForeName": "Robert A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20521811", "10.1021/es1006669"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
