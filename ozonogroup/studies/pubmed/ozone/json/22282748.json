In experiment 1, dentin was treated with ozone before the bonding procedure, while in experiment 2, ozone was applied to resin/dentin bonded interfaces. In experiment 1, dentin surfaces were treated either with ozone gas (2100 ppm), ozonated water (3.5 ppm), or distilled water for 120 s, and then bonded with SB2 or XP according to manufacturers' instructions. Hybrid composite buildups were incrementally constructed and the teeth were sectioned into resin-dentin sticks (0.8 mm2). In experiment 2, dentin surfaces were first bonded with SB2 or XP, composite buildups were constructed, and bonded sticks obtained. The sticks were treated with ozone as previously described. Bonded sticks were tested under tensile stress at 1 mm/min. Silver nitrate impregnation along the resin/dentin interfaces was also evaluated under SEM.", "Two-way ANOVA (adhesive and ozone treatment) detected no significant effect for the cross-product interaction and the main factors in the two experiments (p > 0.05), which was confirmed by the photomicrographs.", "Ozone gas and ozonated water used before the bonding procedure or on resin/dentin bonded interfaces have no deleterious effects on the bond strengths and interfaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Department of Dental Materials, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garcia", "ForeName": "Eugenio Jose", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Serrano", "ForeName": "Alexandra Patr\u00edcia", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urruchi", "ForeName": "Wilfredo Irrazabal", "Initials": "WI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deboni", "ForeName": "Maria Cristina", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reis", "ForeName": "Alessandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grande", "ForeName": "Rosa Helena", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loguercio", "ForeName": "Alessandro Dourado", "Initials": "AD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Adhes Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "100888552", "ISSNLinking": "1461-5185"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adper single bond 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resin Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "XP-Bond"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "filtek Z350"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E4GA8884NN", "NameOfSubstance": "phosphoric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Etching, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Cements"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photomicrography"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Resin Cements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver Staining"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Mechanical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tensile Strength"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22282748", "10.3290/j.jad.a22707", "842994"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
