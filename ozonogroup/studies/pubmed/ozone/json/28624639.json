'55/56'\u00d7P. deltoides cv. 'Imperial') and 107 (P. euramericana cv. '74/76') were exposed to five ozone concentrations in 15 open-top chambers (OTCs). Both ozone exposure (AOT40, Accumulation Over a Threshold hourly ozone concentration of 40ppb) and flux-based (POD<sub>7</sub>, Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above an hourly flux threshold of 7nmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> PLA (projected leaf area) s<sup>-1</sup>) response relationships were established with photosynthesis, leaf morphology and biomass variables. Increases in both metrics showed significant negative relationships with light-saturated photosynthesis rate, chlorophyll content, leaf mass per area, actual photochemical efficiency of PSII in the light and root biomass but not with stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>), leaf and stem biomass. Ozone had a greater impact on belowground than on aboveground biomass. The ranking of these indicators from higher to lower sensitivity to ozone was: photosynthetic parameters, morphological index, and biomass. Clone 546 had a higher sensitivity to ozone than clone 107. The coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) were similar between exposure- and flux-based dose-response relationships for each variable. The critical levels (CLs) for a 5% reduction in total biomass for the two poplar clones were 14.8ppmh for AOT40 and 9.8mmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> PLA for POD<sub>7</sub>. In comparison, equivalent reduction occurred at much lower values in photosynthetic parameters (4ppmh for AOT40 and 3mmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> PLA for POD<sub>7</sub>) and LMA (5.8ppmh for AOT40 and 4mmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> PLA for POD<sub>7</sub>). While in recent decades different CLs have been proposed for several plant receptors especially in Europe, studies focusing on both flux-based dose-response relationships and CLs are still scarce in Asia. This study is therefore valuable for regional O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment in Asia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
