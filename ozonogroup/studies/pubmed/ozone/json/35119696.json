The effect of different numbers of nerve crushes and exercise on motor function recovery is unknown. We aimed to examine how different numbers of crushes of the rat sciatic nerve affects muscle reinnervation and plasticity of spinal circuits and the effect of exercise intervention.", "Single and multiple sciatic nerve crush models with different numbers of crushes were created in rats. Treadmill exercise was performed at 10\u00a0m/min for 60\u2009min, five times a week. Muscle reinnervation and synaptic changes in L4-5 motor neurons were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Behavioral tests were the sciatic functional index (SFI) and the pinprick tests.", "The percentage of soleus muscle reinnervation was not significantly increased by the presence of exercise in single or multiple crushes. Exercise after a single crush increased the contact of motor neurons with VGLUT1-containing structures (Exercised vs. Unexercised, 12.9% vs. 8.7%; p\u2009<\u2009.01), but after multiple crushes, it decreased with or without exercise (8.1% vs. 8.6%). Exercise after a single crush significantly improved SFI values from 14 to 24\u2009days, and exercise after multiple crushes from 21 to 35\u2009days (all p\u2009<\u2009.05). The pinprick test showed no difference in recovery depending on the number of crushes or whether or not exercised.", "Different numbers of sciatic nerve crushes affect muscle reinnervation and motor neuron synaptic changes differently, but motor function recovery may improve with exercise regardless of the number of crushes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0463-6124"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Saitama, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Fellowship for Young Scientists, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Minegishi", "ForeName": "Yuki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4830-0120"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nishimoto", "ForeName": "Junji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Saitama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Uto", "ForeName": "Minori", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Saitama, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Fellowship for Young Scientists, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Kaichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Saitama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Oka", "ForeName": "Yuichiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health and Social Services, Saitama Prefectural University, Saitama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kokubun", "ForeName": "Takanori", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health and Social Services, Saitama Prefectural University, Saitama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Murata", "ForeName": "Kenji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation, Hiroshima International Medical and Welfare College, Hiroshima, Japan."}], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "Hidenori", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3313-9717"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health and Social Services, Saitama Prefectural University, Saitama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kanemura", "ForeName": "Naohiko", "Initials": "N"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "18-02", "Agency": "Grant of Saitama Chapter, Japanese Physical Therapy Association for Study Promotion", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "20J23448", "Agency": "Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Muscle Nerve", "NlmUniqueID": "7803146", "ISSNLinking": "0148-639X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crush Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": ["innervation"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Crush"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peripheral Nerve Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Recovery of Function"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Sciatic Nerve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sciatic Neuropathy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Terzis JK, Kokkalis ZT.
