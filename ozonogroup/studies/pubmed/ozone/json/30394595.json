For example, compounds such as the \u03b2-blocker atenolol (ATE), widely used for the treatment of cardiac disease, are detected in drinking water since conventional water treatment plants are not designed to remove them. Thus, the evaluation of ATE removal at different water oxidative treatment processes, identification of its degradation products and evaluation of their toxicity is necessary.", "Aqueous solutions of ATE (10\u2009mg/L) were submitted to oxidative treatments of chlorination ([NaClO]\u2009=\u200910\u2009mg/L), ozonation ([O<sub>3</sub> ]\u2009=\u20098\u2009mg/L), photocatalysis ([TiO<sub>2</sub> ]\u2009=\u2009120\u2009mg/L and UV-C light) and photolysis (UV-C light). The removal of ATE and formation of degradation products (DPs) were monitored by mass spectrometry. To assess acute cytotoxicity, DPs were submitted to colorimetric MTT assay using HepG2 cells. The Ecological Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) software was applied to estimate the acute and chronic toxicity of identified DPs at different trophic levels.", "Photocatalysis was the treatment that demonstrated greater efficiency, removing 94% of the initial ATE. For the four tested treatments, 12 DPs were confirmed after 30\u2009min. Moreover, some of the identified DPs were unpublished in the literature. Through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), it was possible to elucidate the structure of the DPs. Solutions of DPs were not considered to be toxic to HepG2 cells. Only the DP with a molecular formula of C<sub>13</sub> H<sub>19</sub> NO<sub>3</sub> (m/z 238.1438) could be considered detrimental to daphnid and green algae.", "Low rates of organic matter removal and high rates of ATE degradation were obtained in the applied treatments after 30\u2009min. Although the treated solutions were not toxic to HepG2 cells, one of the degradation products can be considered an environmental concern since it presents chronic toxicity to daphnid and green algae."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Post-Graduate Programme (ProAmb), Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, 35400-000, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6314-6208"], "LastName": "Quaresma", "ForeName": "Amanda V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, 35400-000, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sousa", "ForeName": "Bianca A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Department, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, 35400-000, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Karina T S", "Initials": "KTS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Department, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, 35400-000, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Silvana Q", "Initials": "SQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, 35400-000, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Werle", "ForeName": "Alceni A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, 35400-000, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1940-3304"], "LastName": "Afonso", "ForeName": "Robson J C F", "Initials": "RJCF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "APQ-00918-13", "Agency": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Apoio \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30394595", "10.1002/rcm.8338"]}}]}
