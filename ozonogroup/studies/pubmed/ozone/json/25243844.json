Soils are large contributors to this increase through microbial processes that are enhanced in agricultural land due to nitrogenous fertilizer applications. Denitrification, a respiratory process using nitrogen oxides as electron acceptors in the absence of oxygen, is the main source of N\u2082O. The end product of denitrification is benign dinitrogen (N\u2082) and understanding what regulates the shift in ratio of N\u2082O and N\u2082 emission is crucial for mitigation strategies. The role of organic carbon in controlling N\u2082O reduction is poorly understood, and mostly based on application of glucose. Here we investigated how a range of carbon compounds (succinate, butyrate, malic acid, acetate, glucose, sucrose and cysteine) affect denitrifier N\u2082/N\u2082O production stoichiometry under laboratory conditions. The results show that a soil's capability in efficiently reducing N\u2082O to N\u2082 is C substrate dependent and most compounds tested were different in regards to this efficiency compared to glucose. We challenge the concept of using glucose as a model soil C compound in furthering our understanding of denitrification and specifically the efficiency in the N\u2082O reductase enzyme. Organic acids, commonly exuded by roots, increased N\u2082/N\u2082O ratios compared to glucose, and therefore mitigated net N\u2082O release and we suggest provides better insights into soil regulatory aspects of N\u2082O reduction. The widespread use of glucose in soil laboratory studies could lead to misleading knowledge on the functioning of denitrification in soils with regards to N\u2082O reduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Morley", "ForeName": "Nicholas J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Richardson", "ForeName": "David J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Baggs", "ForeName": "Elizabeth M", "Initials": "EM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "BB/H012796/1", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "BB/H013431/1", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denitrification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Smith P, Martino D, Cai Z, Gwary D, Janzen H, et al.
