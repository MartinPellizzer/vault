Many studies explored the association between air pollutants and frequency of asthma hospital visits, although their effects are unclear. This study examined the link between air pollution, asthma, and socioeconomic and demographic factors. A questionnaire survey was administered among four age groups (15-25, 25-45, 45-60, and over 60\u00a0years old) in public and private hospitals of Lahore city. Daily average concentrations of five air pollutants including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) were recorded at ten fixed air monitoring sites in Lahore city. There were favorable connections between outpatient department (OPD) asthma visits (64%) and levels of outdoor air quality during winter season throughout the study period. The correlation between 1, 29, and 370 asthma patients and average daily air pollution levels found that the condition was more prevalent in females (53%) than males (47%). There was a significant correlation between PM<sub>10</sub> exposure and asthma OPD visits in the city (p 0.001), as well as the elevated PM<sub>10</sub> levels were substantially linked with OPD asthma visits over the winter season in the city. The hazard index (HI) for all adult population was estimated 0.001132. The study's findings indicate that exposure to ambient air pollution is a significant predictor of asthma hospital visits, particularly among the elderly. Strategies can be developed by policymakers in response to the worrying situation of allergic disease asthma in industrial cities due to air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
