The average concentrations of GEM, RGM, and Hg(p) were 1.4 +/- 0.4 ng m(-3), 1.8 +/- 2.2 pg m(-3), and 3.2 +/- 3.7 pg m(-3), respectively. RGM represents < 3.5% of total atmospheric Hg or total gaseous Hg (TGM: GEM + RGM) and Hg(p) represents < 3.0% of the total atmospheric Hg. The highest mean concentrations of GEM, RGM, and Hg(p) were measured during winter and summer whereas the lowest mean concentrations were measured during spring and fall. Significant diurnal patterns were apparent in warm seasons for all species whereas diurnal patterns were weak in cold seasons. RGM was better correlated with ozone concentration and temperature in both warm (rho (RGM - ozone) = 0.57, p < 0.001; rho (RGM - temperature) = 0.62, p < 0.001) and cold seasons (rho (RGM - ozone) = 0.48, p = 0.002; rho (RGM - temperature) = 0.54, p = 0.011) than the other species. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis was applied to identify possible Hg sources. This method identified areas in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, and Missouri, which coincided well with sources reported in a 2002 U.S. mercury emissions inventory."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York 13699-5710, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyun-Deok", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holsen", "ForeName": "Thomas M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hopke", "ForeName": "Philip K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kentucky"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Missouri"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ohio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pennsylvania"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "West Virginia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18754488", "10.1021/es7028137"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
