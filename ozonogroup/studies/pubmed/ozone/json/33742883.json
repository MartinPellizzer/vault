The E-HOC process has a better removal effect on dissolved organic matter in WWTP effluent, achieving 46.4%, 20.0%, 19.4%, 36.1%, and 49.7% higher removal than EC, ozonation, pre-ozonation-EC, electrocoagulation-ozonation, and chemical coagulation, respectively. To determine the mechanism of the E-HOC process, quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were conducted, which confirmed that metal coagulants can be used as a catalyst to effectively increase the generation of the hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH). Synergistic effects between ozone and the coagulants (SOC) were also found to be involved. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) illustrated that the surface hydroxyl groups of the coagulant (hydrolyzed species produced by Al anode electrolysis) were the active sites for the generation of\u00b7OH in the SOC reaction. Based on a kinetics analysis of organic matter removal in the E-HOC system, SOC effects and ozonation played dominant roles in the E-HOC process. Additionally, the SOC created a new pathway for\u00b7OH formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Xin-Yue", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Machinery International Engineering Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd.
