The search included studies published in English or French language, and was based on title, abstract, and complete text. Documents not meeting inclusion requirements were excluded.", "We identified 18 studies published in the last five years that were eligible for inclusion in this review. We found that these studies concerned European, Asian, American, and Oceanic cities. Extreme variations in temperature, humidity, wind speed, exceptional incidents like hurricanes, cold and heat waves, and seasonal shifts were strongly correlated with the worsening of asthmatic symptoms, particularly in childhood. In addition, excessive concentrations of air pollutants and aeroallergens were linked to pediatric asthma emergency hospital admissions.", "A significant association between the consequences of CC and asthma in adults particularly in children has been demonstrated. Future research should quantify the impact of global change in climate regarding the aeroallergens' distribution in terms of geography and time. It is also necessary to research the impact of air pollution on asthmatic health, like sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and particles having an aerodynamic diameter lower than 2.5\u2009\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1489-5645"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory of Innovation in Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques, Health Sciences and Environment Laboratory, Health Sciences, Epidemiology and Human Pathologies Research Team, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Rida", "ForeName": "Jamila", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques, Health Sciences and Environment Laboratory, Health Sciences, Epidemiology and Human Pathologies Research Team, Agadir, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geosciences, Environment and Geomatic Laboratory, Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Bouchriti", "ForeName": "Youssef", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geosciences, Environment and Geomatic Laboratory, Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Ait Haddou", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Achbani", "ForeName": "Abderrahmane", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Sine", "ForeName": "Hasnaa", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory of Innovation in Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Serhane", "ForeName": "Hind", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38953539", "10.1080/02770903.2024.2375272"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
