Although different formation mechanisms involving reactive intermediates and/or closed-shell monomeric species have been proposed for the particle-phase dimers, their relative importance remains in debate. Here, we report unambiguous experimental evidence of the important role of acyl organic peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>) and a small but non-negligible contribution from stabilized Criegee intermediates (SCIs) in the formation of particle-phase dimers during ozonolysis of \u03b1-pinene, one of the most important precursors for biogenic SOA. Specifically, we find that acyl RO<sub>2</sub>-involved reactions explain 50-80% of total oxygenated dimer signals (C<sub>15</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>, O/C \u2265 0.4) and 20-30% of the total less oxygenated (O/C < 0.4) dimer signals. In particular, they contribute to 70% of C<sub>15</sub>-C<sub>19</sub> dimer ester formation, likely mainly via the decarboxylation of diacyl peroxides arising from acyl RO<sub>2</sub> cross-reactions. In comparison, SCIs play a minor role in the formation of C<sub>15</sub>-C<sub>19</sub> dimer esters but react noticeably with the most abundant C<sub>9</sub> and C<sub>10</sub> carboxylic acids and/or carbonyl products to form C<sub>19</sub> and C<sub>20</sub> dimeric peroxides, which are prone to particle-phase transformation to form more stable dimers without the peroxide functionality. This work provides a clearer view of the formation pathways of particle-phase dimers from \u03b1-pinene oxidation and would help reduce the uncertainties in future atmospheric modeling of the budget, properties, and health and climate impacts of SOA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1157-5101"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yingqi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ziyue", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shunyao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chenxi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Huayun", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Esters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36178682", "10.1021/acs.est.2c02090"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
