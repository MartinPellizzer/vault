Over the last 5 years we have studied some of the biological impacts of solar UV-B on natural ecosystems of this region. We have addressed two general problems: (i) do the fluctuations in UV-B levels under the influence of the Antarctic ozone 'hole' have any measurable biological impact, and (ii) what are the long-term effects of solar (ambient) UV-B on the Tierra del Fuego ecosystems? In this paper, we provide an overview of the progress made during the first 4 years of the project. We highlight and discuss the following results: (1) ambient UV-B has subtle but significant inhibitory effects on the growth of herbaceous and graminoid species of this region (growth reduction < or = 12%), whereas no consistent inhibitory effects could be detected in woody perennials; (2) in the species investigated in greatest detail, Gunnera magellanica, the inhibitory effect of solar UV-B is accompanied by increased levels of DNA damage in leaf tissue, and the DNA damage density in the early spring is clearly correlated with the dose of weighted UV-B measured at ground level; (3) the herbaceous species investigated thus far show little or no acclimation responses to ambient UV-B such as increased sunscreen levels and DNA repair capacity; and (4) ambient UV-B has significant effects on heterotrophic organisms, included marked inhibitory effects on insect herbivory. The results from the experiments summarized in this review clearly indicate that UV-B influences several potentially important processes and ecological interactions in the terrestrial ecosystems of Tierra del Fuego."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IFEVA, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina. ballare@ifeva.edu.ar"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ballar\u00e9", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rousseau", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Searles", "ForeName": "P S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zaller", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giordano", "ForeName": "C V", "Initials": "CV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robson", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caldwell", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sala", "ForeName": "O E", "Initials": "OE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scopel", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Argentina"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "50"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11693368", "10.1016/s1011-1344(01)00152-x", "S1011-1344(01)00152-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
