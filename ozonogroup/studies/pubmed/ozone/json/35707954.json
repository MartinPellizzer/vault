Thus, we evaluated the potential of both gaseous and aqueous ozone as a potential preharvest insecticide against the adult life stage of the invasive fruit pest, spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura). Gaseous ozone was applied at two dosages, 14,600 and 30,100 ppmv, for varying durations and the respective concentration-time (CT) exposure responses were modeled for sex-specific mortalities recorded at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h following treatment. We found that gaseous ozone primarily caused mortality immediately following exposure, with slight increases 72 h following ozone treatments. The female and male lethal concentration-time (LCT) 50 estimates were significantly different at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after 30,100 ppmv treatments, where males observed an increased mortality response. However, the LCT 99 estimates confidence intervals (95%) of adult female and male D. suzukii were similar at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after 14,600 or 30,100 ppmv ozone treatments. In contrast, ozone dissolved in distilled water at 18.52 ppm (mg/L) did not provide any mortality after total immersion of subjects for 30 s. While gaseous ozone may have some utility as a fumigant for D. suzukii in closed vessels where concentrations could be maintained, we did not identify any insecticidal potential for ozone dissolved in aqueous solution when simulating a preharvest treatment under optimal laboratory conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
