In response to this demand, we innovatively construct a space-time Bayesian neural network parametric regressor to fuse TOAR historical observations, CMIP6 multimodel simulation ensemble, population distributions, land cover properties, and emission inventories altogether and downscale to 10 km \u00d7 10 km spatial resolution with high methodological reliability (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.89-0.97, RMSE = 1.97-3.42 ppbV), fair prediction accuracy (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.69-0.77, RMSE = 5.63-7.97 ppbV), and commendable spatiotemporal extrapolation capabilities (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.62-0.76, RMSE = 5.38-11.7 ppbV). Based on our predictions in 8-h maximum daily average metric, the rural-site surface O<sub>3</sub> are 15.1\u00b17.4 ppbV higher than urban globally averaged across 30 historical years during 1990-2019, with developing countries being of the most evident differences. The globe-wide urban surface O<sub>3</sub> are climbing by 1.9\u00b12.3 ppbV per decade, except for the decreasing trends in eastern United States. On the other hand, the global rural surface O<sub>3</sub> tend to be relatively stable, except for the rising tendencies in China and India. Using CMIP6 model simulations directly without urban-rural differentiation will lead to underestimations of population O<sub>3</sub> exposure by 2.0\u00b10.8 ppbV averaged over each historical year. Our original Bayesian neural network framework contributes to the deep-learning-driven environmental studies methodologically by providing a brand-new feasible way to realize data fusion and downscaling, which maintains high interpretability by conforming to the principles of spatial statistics without compromising the prediction accuracy. Moreover, the 30-year highly spatial resolved monthly surface O<sub>3</sub> database with multiple metrics fills in the literature gap for long-term surface O<sub>3</sub> exposure tracing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8820-909X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, U.K."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Haitong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Youngsub Matthew", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Mingtao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K."}], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Shengxian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Michelle", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4282-0459"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Le", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne Victoria 3004, Australia."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yuming", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Centre for Atmospheric Science, Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K."}], "LastName": "Archibald", "ForeName": "Alexander T", "Initials": "AT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bayes Theorem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34751030", "10.1021/acs.est.1c04797"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
