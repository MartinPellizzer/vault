Individual O<sub>3</sub> exposure concentrations were evaluated using a high temporal-spatial resolution model. Each participant underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to screen for GDM between 24 and 28 gestational weeks. Multiple logistic and multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of O<sub>3</sub> with GDM risks and with blood glucose levels of OGTT, respectively. Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) were used to estimate the critical windows of O<sub>3</sub> exposure for GDM.", "Nearly 13.29 % of participants developed GDM. After controlling for covariates, we observed increased GDM risks per IQR increment of O<sub>3</sub> exposure in the first trimester (OR = 1.738, 95 % CI: 1.002-3.016) and the first two trimesters (OR = 1.576, 95 % CI: 1.005-2.473). Gestational O<sub>3</sub> exposure was positively associated with increased fasting blood glucose (the first trimester: \u03b2 = 2.964, 95 % CI: 1.529-4.398; the first two trimesters: \u03b2 = 1.620, 95 % CI: 0.436-2.804) and 2 h blood glucose (the first trimester: \u03b2 = 6.569, 95 % CI: 1.775-11.363; the first two trimesters: \u03b2 = 6.839, 95 % CI: 2.896-10.782). We also observed a concentration-response relationship of gestational O<sub>3</sub> exposure with GDM risk, as well as fasting and 2 h blood glucose levels. Additionally, 5-10 gestational weeks was identified as a critical window of O<sub>3</sub> exposure for GDM development.", "In summary, we found that gestational O<sub>3</sub> exposure disrupts glucose homeostasis and increases the risk of GDM in pregnant women. Furthermore, 5-10 gestational weeks could be a critical window for the effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on GDM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
