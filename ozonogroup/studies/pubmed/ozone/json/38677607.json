These contaminants have been associated with various adverse health effects. Among different treatment processes, nanofiltration (NF) has demonstrated superior performance in effectively reducing the levels of DBPs compared to conventional processes and ozone-biological activated carbon (O<sub>3</sub>-BAC) processes. In this experiment, we systematically investigated the performance of three advanced membrane filtration treatment schemes, namely \"sand filter\u00a0+\u00a0nanofiltration\" (SF\u00a0+\u00a0NF), \"sand filter\u00a0+\u00a0ozone-biological activated carbon\u00a0+\u00a0nanofiltration\" (SF\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>-BAC\u00a0+\u00a0NF), and \"ultrafiltration\u00a0+\u00a0nanofiltration\" (UF\u00a0+\u00a0NF), in terms of their ability to control disinfection by-product (DBP) formation in treated water, analyzed the source and fate of DBP precursors during chlorination, and elucidated the role of precursor molecular weight distribution during membrane filtration in relation to DBP formation potential (DBPFP). The results indicated that each treatment process reduced DBPFP, as measured by trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) and haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP), with the SF\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>-BAC\u00a0+\u00a0NF process being the most effective (14.27\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 14.88\u00a0\u03bcg/L), followed by the SF\u00a0+\u00a0NF process (21.04\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 16.29\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and the UF\u00a0+\u00a0NF process (26.26\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 21.75\u00a0\u03bcg/L). Tyrosine, tryptophan, and soluble microbial products were identified as the major DBP precursors during chlorination, with their fluorescence intensity decreasing gradually as water treatment progressed. Additionally, while large molecular weight organics (60-100,000\u00a0KDa) played a minor role in DBPFP, small molecular weight organics (0.2-5\u00a0KDa) were highlighted as key contributors to DBPFP, and medium molecular weight organics (5-60\u00a0KDa) could adhere to the membrane surface and reduce DBPFP. Based on these findings, the combined NF process can be reasonably selected for controlling DBP formation, with potential long-term benefits for human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
