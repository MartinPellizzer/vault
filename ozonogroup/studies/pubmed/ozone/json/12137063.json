DBPs were measured also from the distribution systems of three waterworks. Di- and trichloroacetic acids, and chloroform were the major DBPs found in treated water samples. The concentration of six haloacetic acids (HAA6) exceeded the concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs). Chlorinated drinking waters (DWs) originating from surface waters contained the highest concentration of HAA6 and THMs: 108 and 26 microg/l, respectively. The lowest concentrations of DBPs were measured from ozonated and/or activated carbon filtrated and chloraminated DWs. Higher concentrations of HAA6, THMs, and adsorbable organic halogens were measured in summer compared to winter. The levels of chlorinated acetic acids, chloroform, and bromodichloromethane correlated positively with mutagenicity. Past mutagenicity levels of DWs were examined. A major reduction in the use of prechlorination, increased use of chloramine disinfection, and better removal of organic carbon were the most important reasons for the 69% decrease in mutagenicity from 1985 to 1994."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health, National Public Health Institute, Kuopio, Finland. tarja.nissinen@ktl.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nissinen", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miettinen", "ForeName": "I T", "Initials": "IT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martikainen", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vartiainen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Finland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12137063", "10.1016/s0045-6535(02)00034-6", "S0045-6535(02)00034-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
