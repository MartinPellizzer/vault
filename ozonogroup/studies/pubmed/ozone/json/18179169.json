Each batch was treated by the Oxygreen process, a treatment by ozone, in a closed sequential batch reactor. Leucotriene B4 (LTB 4) was induced by germination, but ozone treatment did not increase this effect. Extract obtained from these wheat batches was applied on human epithelial bronchial cells. Wheat extract from nongerminated wheat did not induce any DNA adduct. More the wheat germination gets underway, more DNA adducts are observed. In contrast, germination did not affect the cell viability. Ozonization of wheat exemplified genotoxic effects only if the wheat was germinated. The implication of hydroxamic acids is discussed. In conclusion, ozonization of wheat, of high milling quality, does not pose any problem."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Technologies, ZAC de la Madeleine, Avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Patton CS 61848, 35418 Saint-Malo Cedex, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dubois", "ForeName": "Michel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Canadas", "ForeName": "Delphine", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Despres-Pernot", "ForeName": "Anne-Ga\u00eblle", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coste", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfohl-Leszkowicz", "ForeName": "Annie", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HGW4DR56D", "NameOfSubstance": "Leukotriene B4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Leukotriene B4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18179169", "10.1021/jf0725528"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
