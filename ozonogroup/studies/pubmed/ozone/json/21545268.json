Life on Earth has developed in the context of these backgrounds, and characterizing event rates will elaborate the important influences. This in turn can be a base for comparison with other potential life-bearing planets. In this review, we estimate the intensities and rates of occurrence of many kinds of strong radiation bursts by astrophysical entities, ranging from gamma-ray bursts at cosmological distances to the Sun itself. Many of these present potential hazards to the biosphere; on timescales long compared with human history, the probability of an event intense enough to disrupt life on the land surface or in the oceans becomes large. Both photons (e.g., X-rays) and high-energy protons and other nuclei (often called \"cosmic rays\") constitute hazards. For either species, one of the mechanisms that comes into play even at moderate intensities is the ionization of Earth's atmosphere, which leads through chemical changes (specifically, depletion of stratospheric ozone) to increased ultraviolet B flux from the Sun reaching the surface. UVB is extremely hazardous to most life due to its strong absorption by the genetic material DNA and subsequent breaking of chemical bonds. This often leads to mutation or cell death. It is easily lethal to the microorganisms that lie at the base of the food chain in the ocean. We enumerate the known sources of radiation and characterize their intensities at Earth and rates or upper limits on these quantities. When possible, we estimate a \"lethal interval,\" our best estimate of how often a major extinction-level event is probable given the current state of knowledge; we base these estimates on computed or expected depletion of stratospheric ozone. In general, moderate-level events are dominated by the Sun, but the far more severe infrequent events are probably dominated by gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. We note for the first time that so-called \"short-hard\" gamma-ray bursts are a substantial threat, comparable in magnitude to supernovae and greater than that of the higher-luminosity long bursts considered in most past work. Given their precursors, short bursts may come with little or no warning."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA. melott@ku.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melott", "ForeName": "Adrian L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Brian C", "Initials": "BC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Astrobiology", "NlmUniqueID": "101088083", "ISSNLinking": "1557-8070"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cosmic Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Earth, Planet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solar Activity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21545268", "10.1089/ast.2010.0603"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
