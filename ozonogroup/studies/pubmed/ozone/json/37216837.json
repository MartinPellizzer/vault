Results indicate that the spatial variation of O<sub>3</sub> depends on the part of the O<sub>3</sub> distribution being analyzed. Metrics associated with moderate O<sub>3</sub> concentrations depict an increasing O<sub>3</sub> gradient between the northern and Mediterranean coasts due to climatic factors, while for metrics considering the upper end of the O<sub>3</sub> distribution, this climatic gradient tends to attenuate in favor of hotspot regions pointing to relevant local/regional O<sub>3</sub> formation. A classification of atmospheric regions in Spain is proposed based on their O<sub>3</sub> pollution patterns, to identify priority areas (or O<sub>3</sub> hotspots) where local/regional precursor abatement might significantly reduce O<sub>3</sub> during pollution episodes. The trends assessment reveals a narrowing of the O<sub>3</sub> distribution at the national level, with metrics influenced by lower concentrations tending to increase over time, and those reflecting the higher end of the O<sub>3</sub> distribution tending to decrease. While most stations show no statistically significant variations, contrasting O<sub>3</sub> trends are evident among the O<sub>3</sub> hotspots. The Madrid area exhibits the majority of upward trends across all metrics, frequently with the highest increasing rates, implying increasing O<sub>3</sub> associated with both chronic and episodic exposure. The Valencian Community area exhibits a mixed variation pattern, with moderate to high O<sub>3</sub> metrics increasing and peak metrics decreasing, while O<sub>3</sub> in areas downwind of Barcelona, the Guadalquivir Valley and Puertollano shows no variations. Sevilla is the only large Spanish city with generalized O<sub>3</sub> decreasing trends. The different O<sub>3</sub> trends among hotspots highlight the need for mitigation measures to be designed at a local/regional scale to be effective. This approach may offer valuable insights for other countries developing O<sub>3</sub> mitigation plans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
