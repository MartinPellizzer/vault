Poisson log linear regression models were used to investigate the relation of the daily event rate with daily air pollution concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and black smoke from 1981 to 1995, and of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM10) from 1992 to 1995. Adjustments were made for seasonal and weekday variation, daily temperature, and wind speed.", "The most significant findings were positive associations over the period 1981-95 between black smoke as a mean of the previous three days and daily all cause mortality in people aged > or = 65, and respiratory mortality also in this age group (3.9% increase in mortality for a 10 micrograms/m3 increment in black smoke). For hospital emergency admissions between 1992 and 1995 the two most significant findings (p < 0.05) were for cardiovascular admissions of people aged > or = 65 which showed a positive association with PM10 as a mean of the 3 previous days, and a negative association with O3 as a mean of the previous three days. Analyses of outcomes based on linkage with previous cardiorespiratory emergency admissions did not show substantially different results.", "These data suggest that in the City of Edinburgh, after correction for confounders, there was a small but significant association between concentrations of black smoke and respiratory mortality in the older age group, probably attributable to higher pollution levels in the early part of the study period. There were also generally weak and variable associations between day to day changes in concentrations of urban air pollutants at a single central point and emergency hospital admission rates from cardiac and respiratory disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Medical School, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prescott", "ForeName": "G J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cohen", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elton", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fowkes", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agius", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9422759", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Scotland"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Epidemiol Community Health. 1990 Dec;44(4):321-4", "ArticleIdList": ["2277256"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 1995 Jan 21;345(8943):176-8", "ArticleIdList": ["7741860"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1994 Oct 22;309(6961):1029-30", "ArticleIdList": ["7950726"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health. 1994 Nov;84(11):1738-42", "ArticleIdList": ["7977910"]}, {"Citation": "Annu Rev Public Health. 1994;15:107-32", "ArticleIdList": ["8054077"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1994 Sep;150(3):648-55", "ArticleIdList": ["8087333"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1994 Feb;49(2):133-40", "ArticleIdList": ["8128402"]}, {"Citation": "N Engl J Med. 1993 Dec 9;329(24):1753-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8179653"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1994 Jan;64(1):26-35", "ArticleIdList": ["8287840"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1994 Jan;64(1):36-52", "ArticleIdList": ["8287841"]}, {"Citation": "Health Bull (Edinb). 1993 Mar;51(2):72-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8514493"]}, {"Citation": "Occup Environ Med. 1995 Dec;52(12):790-2", "ArticleIdList": ["8563840"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1996 Mar 16;312(7032):665-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8597732"]}, {"Citation": "J Epidemiol Community Health. 1996 Apr;50 Suppl 1:s63-70", "ArticleIdList": ["8758227"]}, {"Citation": "Occup Environ Med. 1997 Feb;54(2):108-16", "ArticleIdList": ["9072018"]}, {"Citation": "Occup Environ Med. 1997 Mar;54(3):145-51", "ArticleIdList": ["9155775"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1997 Jun 7;314(7095):1658-63", "ArticleIdList": ["9180068"]}, {"Citation": "Occup Environ Med. 1997 Aug;54(8):535-40", "ArticleIdList": ["9326156"]}, {"Citation": "Occup Environ Med. 1997 Nov;54(11):781-4", "ArticleIdList": ["9538349"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9930092", "PMC1757510", "10.1136/oem.55.10.697"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
