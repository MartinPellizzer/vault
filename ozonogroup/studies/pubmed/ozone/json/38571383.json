However, understanding their complex interactions with dynamic bacterial behaviors, especially during the disinfection process, remains very limited. In this work, we investigated the impact of EPS on bacterial disinfection kinetics by developing a permanent EPS removal strategy. We genetically disrupted the synthesis of exopolysaccharides, the structural components of EPS, in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a well-known EPS-producing opportunistic pathogen found in diverse environments, creating an EPS-deficient strain. This method ensured a lasting absence of EPS while maintaining bacterial integrity and viability, allowing for real-time in situ investigations of the roles of EPS in disinfection. Our findings indicate that removing EPS from bacteria substantially lowered their susceptibility threshold to disinfectants such as ozone, chloramine B, and free chlorine. This removal also substantially accelerated disinfection kinetics, shortened the resistance time, and increased disinfection efficiency, thereby enhancing the overall bactericidal effect. The absence of EPS was found to enhance bacterial motility and increase bacterial cell vulnerability to disinfectants, resulting in greater membrane damage and intensified reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon exposure to disinfectants. These insights highlight the central role of EPS in bacterial defenses and offer promising implications for developing more effective disinfection strategies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhen-Jie", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Han-Quan", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Fei-Fei", "Initials": "FF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7144-0968"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5247-6244"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Han-Qing", "Initials": "HQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38571383", "10.1021/acs.est.4c01612"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
