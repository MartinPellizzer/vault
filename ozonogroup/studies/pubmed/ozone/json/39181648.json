Here the \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst treated with 0.1 mol/L nitric acid exhibits higher ozone decomposition activity at high relative humidity than the counterpart treated with acetic acid. Besides the increases in surface area and lattice dislocation, the improved activity can be due to relatively higher Mn valence on the surface and newly-formed Br\u00f8nsted acid sites adjacent to oxygen vacancies. The remnant nitro species deposited on the catalyst by nitric acid treatment is ideal hydrophobic groups at ambient conditions. The decomposition route is also proposed based on the DRIFTS and DFT calculations: ozone is facile to adsorb on the oxygen vacancy, and the protonic H of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites bonds to the terminal oxygen of ozone to accelerate its cleavage to O<sub>2</sub>, reducing the reaction energy barrier of O<sub>2</sub> desorption."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
