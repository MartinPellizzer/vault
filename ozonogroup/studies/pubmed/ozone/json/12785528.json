Propanal and nonanal tended to have the largest concentrations, with afternoon maxima of approximately 0.3 ppb. These aldehydes typically represented a significant fraction of the VOC reactivity defined as k(OH)[VOC]. However, this information is misleading with regard to the impact of these aldehydes on ozone formation, as their oxidation can represent a significant NOx sink. Motivated by the relatively large nonanal concentrations, we conducted a laboratory study of the products of the nonanal + OH reaction. The OH + nonanal reaction rate constant was determined via the relative rate technique and found to be 3.6 (+/- 0.7) x 10(-11) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1). Under conditions of high [NO2]/[NO], we determined that 50 +/- 6% of OH-nonanal reaction occurs via abstraction of the aldehydic H-atom through measurement of the peroxynonanyl nitrate yield. We also studied the production of organic nitrates from OH reaction with nonanal in the presence of NO. As expected, a major product (20% at large [NO]/[NO2]) of this reaction was 1-nitrooxy octane. We calculate that the branching ratio for 1-nitrooxy octane formation from peroxyoctyl radicals is 0.40 +/- 0.05. On the basis of these measurements, we find that for more than 50% of the time OH reacts with nonanal (for midday summer conditions) an organic nitrate or PAN compound is formed, making this important atmospheric aldehyde an effective NOx sink."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, 1393 Brown Building, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bowman", "ForeName": "Julia Hurst", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barket", "ForeName": "Dennis J", "Initials": "DJ", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shepson", "ForeName": "Paul B", "Initials": "PB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2L2WBY9K6T", "NameOfSubstance": "nonanal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tennessee"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12785528", "10.1021/es026220p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
