In order to gain insights on VOCs characteristics and their potentials for O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation, the volume fraction of 102 VOCs in autumn and winter in the urban area of Tongchuan were monitored using the TH-300B online monitoring system. The maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) coefficient and the fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC) were used to estimate the ozone formation potential (OFP) and SOA formation potential (SOAFP), respectively. The <i>\u03c6</i>(TVOC, total VOCs) were (50.52\u00b116.81)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in autumn and (63.21\u00b135.24)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in winter. The OFPs were 138.43\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in autumn and 137.123\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in winter, and the SOAFPs were 3.098 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 0.612 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Alkanes (26.19%) and aromatics (26.04%) were the most abundant species in autumn, and alkanes (48.88%) were the most abundant species in winter. Trans-2-pentene, toluene, and <i>m/p</i>-xylene were the most reactive species in terms of OFPs in autumn, and ethylene, acetylene, and propylene were the top three species contributing to the total OFPs in winter. Toluene, <i>m/p</i>-xylene, and ethylbenzene contributed the most to the total SOAFPs in both of autumn and winter. Traffic emissions were considered as the major source of VOCs in both seasons. VOCs from biomass/coal combustion emissions showed seasonal differences, which were more prominent in winter. The results can provide references for the \"one city, one policy\" to mitigate regional VOCs pollution and improve ambient air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water and Environment, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Subsurface Hydrology and Ecological Effects in Arid Region, Ministry of Education, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xiao", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water and Environment, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Subsurface Hydrology and Ecological Effects in Arid Region, Ministry of Education, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiang-Hao", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water and Environment, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guang-Hua", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water and Environment, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Zhen-Zhen", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water and Environment, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water and Environment, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water and Environment, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Subsurface Hydrology and Ecological Effects in Arid Region, Ministry of Education, Chang'an University, Xi'an 710064, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Shun-Xi", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34989498", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202104180"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
