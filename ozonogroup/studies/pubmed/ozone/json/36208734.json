As a widely used class of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones (FQs) generally accumulated in the environments as traditional sewage treatment plants cannot completely remove them. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been shown to be a promising method for the abatement of antibiotic contamination. In this review, influencing factors and relevant mechanisms of FQs removal by various AOPs were summarized. Compared with other AOPs, photocatalytic ozone may be considered as a cost-effective method for degrading FQs. Finally, the benefits and application restrictions of AOPs were discussed, along with proposed research directions to provide new insights into the control of FQs pollutant via AOPs in practical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
