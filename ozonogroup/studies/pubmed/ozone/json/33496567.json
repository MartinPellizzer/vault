Prolonged UV/ozone oxidation combined with proper surface functionalizations and a novel microchip bonding method using thiol-epoxy click reaction enable the robust attachment of the photopolymerized hydrogel to the microchannel surface for eventual operation in electrolytes as an ionic circuit. The stretchable ionic diode constructed on the PDMS microchip shows a superior rectification ratio even under tensile stress and long-term storage stability. Furthermore, the combination of the ionic circuit and unique material properties of PDMS allows us to maximize the versatility and diversify the functionalities of the iontronic device, as demonstrated in a pressure-driven ionic switch and chip-integrated ionic regulator. Its iontronic signal transmission mimicking the excitatory and inhibitory synapses also evinces the potential of the hydrogel-based iontronics on the PDMS microchip as developed toward an aqueous neuromimetic information processor while opening up new opportunities for various bioinspired applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2518-278X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Seok Hee", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sung Il", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Advanced Materials (RIAM), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hae-Ryung", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Advanced Materials (RIAM), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Seung-Min", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yeon", "ForeName": "Song Yi", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Min-Ah", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program in Nano Science and Technology, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16229, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sunmi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7276-1947"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Advanced Materials (RIAM), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jeong-Yun", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2562-375X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Advanced Materials (RIAM), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}], "LastName": "Joo", "ForeName": "Young-Chang", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1092-8550"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program in Nano Science and Technology, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16229, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16229, Korea."}], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Taek Dong", "Initials": "TD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33496567", "10.1021/acsami.0c19892"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
