Here, tetramethylsilane (TMS) is selected as a model to study the photochemical oxidation mechanisms for VOSiCs using <i>ab initio</i> and RRKM theory/master equation kinetic modeling. Under tropospheric conditions, the radical (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiCH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022</sup> reacts with O<sub>2</sub> to produce a stabilized peroxyl radical, which is expected to ultimately yield the alkoxyl radical (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiCH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>\u2022</sup>. At combustion-relevant temperatures, however, a well-skipping reaction to (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiO<sup>\u2022</sup> + HCHO dominates. Importantly, the (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiCH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>\u2022</sup> radical is predicted to rearrange to (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiOCH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022</sup> with a very low reaction barrier, enabling an auto-oxidation process involving addition of a second O<sub>2</sub>. Subsequent oxidation reaction mechanisms of (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiOCH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022</sup> have been developed, with the major product predicted to be the trimethylsilyl formate (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiOCHO, an experimentally observed TMS oxidation product. The production of substantially oxygenated compounds following a single radical initiation reaction has implications for the ability of VOSiCs to contribute to ozone and particle formation in both outdoor and indoor environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9263-493X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Parkville 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Zhonghua", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4284-4474"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Parkville 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "da Silva", "ForeName": "Gabriel", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32567312", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c02922"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
