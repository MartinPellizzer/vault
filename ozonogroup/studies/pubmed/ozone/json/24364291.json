Styrene oxidation by O3/H2O2 was investigated. Ozone dosage, residence time, H2o2 volume fraction, spray density and molar ratio of O3/C8H8 on styrene removal were evaluated. The experimental results showed that styrene removal efficiency achieved 85.7%. The optimal residence time, H2O2, volume fraction, spray density and O3/C8H8 molar ratio were 20. 6 s, 10% , 1.72 m3.(m2.h)-1 and 0.46, respectively. The gas-phase degradation intermediate products were benzaldehyde(C6H5CHO) and benzoic acid (C6H5 COOH) , which were identified by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). The degradation mechanism of styrene is presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China. anniedam@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jue-Cong", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qian-Ru", "Initials": "QR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Qi-Hong", "Initials": "QH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yu-Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zai-Li", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Qing-Juan", "Initials": "QJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Zai-Shan", "Initials": "ZS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "44LJ2U959V", "NameOfSubstance": "Styrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Styrene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24364291"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
