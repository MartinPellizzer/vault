At baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months, the ECM III and DIAGNOdent were employed. Subsequently, the root caries lesions were clinically assessed for color, hardness, cavitation, dimensions, distance from the gingival margin, and severity index. Modified USPHS criteria were also performed after 1, 3, and 6 months. These groups were as follows: Group 1: Ozone application was performed for a period of 10 seconds on caries lesions; Group 2: There was neither ozone nor root sealant application on root caries; Group 3: Ozone treatment and a root sealant were applied to root caries lesions; and Group 4: Only root sealant was applied to root caries.", "At the 6-month recall, 78 subjects were examined. There were no observed adverse events. 38.1% of lesions became hard in the ozone only group, while none of the lesions became hard in the control group (P< 0.001). Noncavitated lesions were more likely to reverse than cavitated lesions. 38.4% of noncavitated lesions became hard, while only 5.7% of cavitated lesions became hard in the ozone only group. Modified USPHS criteria revealed that there were 66.6% intact sealants in the ozone and sealant group and 45.5% intact sealants in the sealant only group (P< 0.05). After 1, 3, and 6 months, the ECM and DIAGNOdent readings showed improvements in the ozone only group when compared to the control group (P< 0.001). The ozone and sealant group also had greater improvements in the ECM and DIAGNOdent values when compared to the sealant only group (P< 0.05)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Adult Oral Health, The Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry, Turner Street, London, UK. aylin.baysan@kcl.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baysan", "ForeName": "Aylin", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8806701", "ISSNLinking": "0894-8275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pit and Fissure Sealants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hardness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pit and Fissure Sealants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Root Caries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17907479"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
