In this work the occurrence and building up of OMs, DBPs of trihalomethanes (THMs) and nitrosamines (NAs) during water purification steps under different pre-ozonation dosages have been studied through lab-scale and pilot-scale studies. Results indicated that 0-0.4\u00a0mg/L of pre-ozonation dosage could reduce organic load of following-up process steps but insufficient to control DBPs. Seasonal performances of a pilot plant indicated that the accumulation of DBPs was much less in summer than in winter. Furthermore the formation potential of NAs was higher in winter than summer when 0.4\u00a0mg/L pre-ozonation was dosed while the maximum removal efficiency of organic matter was found at a pre-ozonation dosage of 0.8\u00a0mg/L in summer. Finally a seasonal trade-off control strategy for both OMs and DBPs was proposed with an elucidated role of pre-ozonation in the drinking water treatment chain. This study provided working principles on optimizing pre-ozonation dosage and a seasonal control strategy for trade-off control of both OMs and DBPs in drinking water treatment plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
