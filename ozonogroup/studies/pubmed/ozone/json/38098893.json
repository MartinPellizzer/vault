When compared to traditional medical treatments like antibiotics and disinfectants, ozone therapy is more budget-friendly, reliable, and conservative. Ozone therapy has proven more effective than the standard treatments available today. Ozone treatment shortens treatment time and eradicates bacterium counts. The fact that there is no discomfort involved with the procedure also helps to boost patient acceptance. Clinical research on the use of ozone in dentistry is limited compared to the amount of research conducted in laboratories. The intent is to assess the knowledge and awareness about ozone dentistry among dental students at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods In this examination, a cross-sectional study was undertaken using a questionnaire that has been pre-validated and pre-tested. A total 201 individuals of BDS graduates took part in the survey. Non-probability convenience sampling was used for selecting the samples. The IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), was used to statistically analyze the collected data. Descriptive statistics in the form of frequencies and percentages were used. To determine the degree of significance, Pearson's chi-squared test was used; results were deemed significant if p < 0.05. Using Lawshe's method, the questionnaire's validity was examined. Results The study population included 65 men (48.87%) and 68 females (51.12%), with 22.75 \u00b1 0.76 as the population's mean age. The research included 51.87% (69) third-year students and 48.12% (64) final-year students. In all, 53.38% knew about dental ozone. Meanwhile, 82.70% of respondents believed that the primary chemical characteristic of ozone is its oxidative nature (p = 0.021), and 78.19% utilized aqueous ozone for hospital disinfection (p = 0.008). With a p = 0.007, 36.84% recognized that ozonated oil is an intra-canal dressing or medicine. Moreover, 37.59% and 42.85% assess gaseous ozone's microbicidal and wound-healing properties accordingly (p = 0.037, statistically significant). The correlation was calculated using Pearson's test with a high level of significance between age and gender as well as gender and awareness (p = 0.01). A statistically significant relationship was found between age and awareness (p = 0.036). Conclusion The clinical application of ozone is a minimally invasive technique for the prevention and treatment of dental disorders. In order to establish ozone therapy as a widely accepted treatment modality in dental practice, it is necessary to do additional research in the field of dentistry. This research should involve controlled clinical studies that have an adequate follow-up duration and utilize standardized metrics. Although ozone therapy has been demonstrated to be effective, its utilization in the field of dentistry is not commonly practiced."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Salam Thekkiniyakath Ali et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Dental Sciences Department, College of Dentistry, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Salam Thekkiniyakath Ali", "ForeName": "Abdul", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Dental Sciences Department, College of Dentistry, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Nuri Alohali", "ForeName": "Sultan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Dental Sciences Department, College of Dentistry, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Hassan Alheraisi", "ForeName": "Yousef", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Dental Sciences Department, College of Dentistry Riyadh Elm University, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Abdullah Aldakhil", "ForeName": "Bader", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Dental Sciences Department, College of Dentistry, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Abdulrazaq Alnafisah", "ForeName": "Sultan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Preventive Dental Sciences Department, College of Dentistry, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, SAU."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim Alsaad", "ForeName": "Faisal", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ozone therapy a new vista in dentistry: integrated review.
