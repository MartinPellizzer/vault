In the drying of acidic solutions, weak acid ions and chloride ions combine with protons and evaporate, depending on the proton concentration. In the drying of alkaline solutions, weak acid ions evaporate or remain as salts depending on the ratio of the concentrations of excess nonvolatile cations (the difference between concentrations of nonvolatile cation and nonvolatile anion) to volatile anions defined as DeltaCA. Under neutral and alkaline conditions, the fate of nitrite depends not only on DeltaCA but also on the drying speed. Nitrite is converted to N2, which is formed by reacting nitrite with ammonium (denitrification), NO and NO2, HONO and salts. In urban areas, nitrite and ammonium can appear in high concentrations in dew. HONO in the atmosphere affects the ozone concentration, but dew formation decreases the concentration of HONO. If chemical denitrification occurs, nitrogen species will decrease in the environment, and as a result, the ozone concentration could decrease. Ozone levels show an ozone depression when dew formed, and a Box model simulation showed an ozone depression by decreasing HONO levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Gakuen-cho 1-1, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan. takenaka@chem.osakafu-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takenaka", "ForeName": "Norimichi", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takayama", "ForeName": "Kayoko", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ojiro", "ForeName": "Naofumi", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimazaki", "ForeName": "Wataru", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohira", "ForeName": "Kingo", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soda", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suzue", "ForeName": "Takahiko", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadanaga", "ForeName": "Yasuhiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bandow", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda", "ForeName": "Yasuaki", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19817385", "10.1021/jp9054395"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
