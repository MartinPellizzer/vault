Both plants employed conventional activated sludge process whereas as last treatment step the first unit use chlorination and the second one ozonation. OPEs were determined in dissolved fraction, total suspended solids and sludge from various treatment stages of WWTPs. Tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TClPP) and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) were the most abundant compounds in influent and treated effluent. Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) was also abundant in suspended solids and sludge. Total concentrations of \u2211<sub>11</sub>OPEs ranged from 2144 to 9743\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in influents, 1237-2909\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in effluents and 3332-14294\u00a0ng\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> dw in sludge. Removal rates from 55% to 80% were observed for most OPEs, whereas chlorinated OPEs, especially for tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) exhibited low removal efficiency. Mass balance analysis showed that biodegradation was the dominant removal mechanism contributing up to 85%. Sorption onto sludge was also relevant removal pathway for most compounds. Emissions of OPEs through effluents and sludge did not pose considerable risk to the aquatic and terrestrial environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
