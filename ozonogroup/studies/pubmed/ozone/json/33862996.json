Ozone exposure increased foliar water loss and minimal conductance to water vapour for P. euramericana, but not P. nigra and P. menziesii. Both Populus species had lower photosynthetic biomass in O<sub>3</sub> treatments, due to production of fewer new leaves, premature leaf abscission and decreased leaf size (P. euramericana only). Leaf abscission was preceded by foliar injury symptoms characteristic of O<sub>3</sub> exposure. \u2022 \u2002Results suggest that exposure to [O<sub>3</sub> ] common during the growing season can increase water loss in Populus saplings, but this effect might be offset by decreased foliar biomass. Importantly, responses were highly species specific in a given O<sub>3</sub> treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Sciences Inc., 421 SW 6th Avenue, Suite 1400, Portland, OR 97204, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schreuder", "ForeName": "Maarten D J", "Initials": "MDJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Meteorology and Air Quality Group, Wageningen University and Research Centre, Duivendaal 2, 6701 AP Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Hove", "ForeName": "Lambertus W A", "Initials": "LWA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biological Sciences, The University of Montana, Missoula, MT 59812, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brewer", "ForeName": "Carol A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Barnes JD, Brown KA. 1990.
