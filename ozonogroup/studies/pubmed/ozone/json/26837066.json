It comprises a UV ozone-bonded Ecoflex-polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic assembly filled with GO nanosuspension, which serves as the working fluid of the tactile sensor. This device is highly flexible and able to withstand numerous modes of deformation as well as distinguish various user-applied mechanical forces it is subjected to, including pressing, stretching, and bending. This tactile sensor is also highly deformable and wearable, and capable of recognizing and differentiating distinct hand muscle-induced motions, such as finger flexing and fist clenching. Moreover, subtle differences in the handgrip strength derived from the first clenching gesture can be identified based on the electrical response of our device. This work highlights the potential application of the GO nanosuspension liquid-based flexible microfluidic tactile sensing platform as a wearable diagnostic and prognostic device for real-time health monitoring. Also importantly, this work can further facilitate the exploration and potential realization of a functional liquid-state device technology with superior mechanical flexibility and conformability."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
