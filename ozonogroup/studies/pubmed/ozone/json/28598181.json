The success rate at 12 months was 93,62% (n. 88/94 restorations), similar to that reported in the literature for pulpotomy.", "The deciduous teeth considered for this study, if treated conventionally, would have probably been subjected to pulpotomy, because of the extension of the carious lesions. The proposed protocol, through the use of ozone, proved to be an excellent alternative, with the fundamental advantage of saving dental tissue and preventing the invasion of the pulp chamber."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DDS, MS, Private practice Varese, Italy."}], "LastName": "Beretta", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DDS, MS, Private practice Monticelli Terme (PR), Italy."}], "LastName": "Federici Canova", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Paediatr Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101121881", "ISSNLinking": "1591-996X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Restoration, Permanent"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tooth, Deciduous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28598181", "10.23804/ejpd.2017.18.02.05"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
