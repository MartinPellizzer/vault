To address the contamination of selected German surface waters examined and the importance of bank filtration in Eastern Germany, investigations on the behaviour of polar organic nitrogen compounds during water treatment were carried out. Test conditions were designed appropriately for drinking water treatment conditions, and the tests were carried out using model water as well as bank filtrate. Test filter studies of microbial degradation of selected compounds demonstrated the following order of biodegradability: ethanolamine > dimethylamine > pyrrolidine > ethylenediamine. piperidine > diethylamine > morpholine > piperazine > cyclohexylamine. Flocculation tests using iron salts as well as aluminium salts as coagulants showed very low removal rates for the amines. The best results for the removal of the polar organic nitrogen compounds from the water were obtained using ozonation. Based on the reaction-rate constants, the order of degradation by ozone is: piperazine > morpholine > ethylenediamine > piperidine, cyclohexylamine > dimethylamine > ethanolamine > pyrrolidine > diethylamine. Disinfection by chlorine-containing agents under drinking water treatment conditions did not give effective elimination of the selected polar nitrogen compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DVGW-TZW Karlsruhe, Aussenstelle Dresden, Germany. pietsch@tzw-dresden.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pietsch", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sacher", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brauch", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11561612", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00086-0", "S0043-1354(01)00086-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
