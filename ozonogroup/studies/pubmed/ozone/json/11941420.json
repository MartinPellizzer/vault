Stress with ozone was taken as the positive control, and the effects of fibronectin (Fn) or its specific sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD peptide) was observed. The results showed: (1) Ozone stress enhanced NO release from BEC, and treatment with Fn also promoted the NO production. The effect of Fn could be blocked by calmodulin inhibitor W(7). (2) Both Fn and RGD showed a dose-dependent promotion on NO release. (3) The NOS activity was significantly elevated in Fn treated group and the effect of Fn was abolished by W(7). A dose-response relation in NOS activity was observed in either Fn treated or RGD treated group. It is concluded that the binding of fibronectin or its specific sequence RGD peptide with integrins of BEC plays a role in upregulating the NOS activity and the NO release, and calmodulin may take part in the pathway of signal transduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Xiang-Ya Medical School, University of South-Central China, Changsha 410078."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "X Q", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Z Q", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "C Q", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "X H", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Li Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "20730130R", "ISSNLinking": "0371-0874"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibronectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Integrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "78VO7F77PN", "NameOfSubstance": "arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibronectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Integrins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11941420"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
