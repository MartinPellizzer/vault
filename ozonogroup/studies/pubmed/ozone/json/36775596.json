To grasp the spatial-temporal variations characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> and the associated health impacts during the implementation of the three-year plan on defending the blue sky in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, data collected from 210 monitoring stations in the YRD from 2017 to 2020 were analyzed using the global Moran's index and Getis-Ord <i>G</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><sup>*</sup> index methods, and the associated health benefits of reduced O<sub>3</sub> exposure were evaluated using the health risk and environmental value assessment methods. The results showed that during the study period, the interquartile range (IQR) of the annual average O<sub>3</sub> concentration and that of the warm season both presented a declining trend. The average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in both warm and cold seasons showed a similar spatial distribution pattern, with the northern part exhibiting the higher concentrations and the southern part showing the lower concentrations. Furthermore, the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the warm season were characterized by high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations clustering in the northern and central part of the region. The proportion of the population exposure to annual average O<sub>3</sub> concentration over 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> decreased from 72.3% in 2017 to 34.8% in 2020 in the YRD. Although the population-weighted annual mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the whole YRD region showed a downward trend, some cities in western Anhui province, northern Jiangsu province, and central Jiangsu province showed fluctuations and even an increasing trend. In terms of health benefits, there were 3782 cases (95% CI:2050-5511 cases) of avoided premature deaths associated with reduced O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the warm season in 2020 compared to 2017. The total health benefit was 26198 million yuan (95% CI:14201-38175 million yuan). Compared to the cost of the main O<sub>3</sub> precursor emission reduction, the cost-benefits ratio was 1:1.67 to 3.23."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yu-Kai", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Hai-Xia", "Initials": "HX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yun-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Li-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ying-Ge", "Initials": "YG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jing-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36775596", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202203053"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
