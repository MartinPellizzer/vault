We studied a series of parameters in the lung, including lung weight, and enzyme activities related to NADPH generation, sulfhydryl metabolism, and cellular detoxification. The results showed that relative to control, exposure to NO2 caused small but nonsignificant changes in all the parameters; O3 caused significant increases in all the parameters except for superoxide dismutase; and a combination of NO2 and O3 caused increases in all the parameters, and the increases were greater than those caused by NO2 or O3 alone. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the effects of combined exposure were synergistic for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase activities, and additive for glutathione peroxidase and disulfide reductase activities, but indifferent from those of O3 exposure for other enzyme activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles 90024."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Afifi", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53-59-8", "NameOfSubstance": "NADP"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADP"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2313741", "10.1080/15287399009531392"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
