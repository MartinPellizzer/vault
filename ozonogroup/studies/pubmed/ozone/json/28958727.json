The Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and its process analysis tool were used to study factors and mechanisms for high ozone mixing ratio at different levels of ozone vertical profiles. A sensitive scenario without chemical initial and boundary conditions (ICBCs) from MOZART4-GEOS5 was applied to study the impact of stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) on vertical ozone. The simulation results indicated that the first high ozone peak near the tropopause was dominated by STE. Results from process analysis showed that: in the urban area, the second peak at approximately 2\u00a0km above ground height was mainly caused by local photochemical production. The third peak (near surface) was mainly caused by the upwind transportation from the suburban/rural areas; in the suburban/rural areas, local photochemical production of ozone dominated the high ozone mixing ratio from the surface to approximately 3\u00a0km height. Furthermore, the capability of indicators to distinguish O<sub>3</sub>-precursor sensitivity along the vertical O<sub>3</sub> profiles was investigated. Two sensitive scenarios, which had cut 30% anthropogenic NO<sub>X</sub> or VOC emissions, showed that O<sub>3</sub>-precursor indicators, specifically the ratios of O<sub>3</sub>/NOy, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/HNO<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub>Z</sub>, could partly distinguish the O<sub>3</sub>-precursor sensitivity between VOCs-sensitive and NOx-sensitive along the vertical profiles. In urban area, the O<sub>3</sub>-precursor relationship transferred from VOCs-sensitive within the boundary layer to NOx-sensitive at approximately 1-3\u00a0km above ground height, further confirming the dominant roles of transportation and photochemical production in high O<sub>3</sub> peaks at the near-ground layer and 2\u00a0km above ground height, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
