The present study aims to minimize BrO(3)(-) formation and eliminate BrO(3)(-) generated during the ozonation of drinking water, particularly in packaged drinking water. Results show that the Br\u207b and BrO(3)(-) levels in GAC-treated water decreased in both bench- and pilot-scale experiments. In the bench-scale experiments, when the empty bed contact time (EBCT) was 5 min, the highest reduction rates of Br(-) in the mineral and ultrapure water were found to be 74.9% and 91.2%, respectively, and those of BrO(3)(-) were 94.4% and 98.8%, respectively. The GAC capacity for Br\u207b and BrO(3)(-) removal increased with the increase in EBCT. Reduction efficiency was better in ultrapure water than in mineral water. In the pilot-scale experiments, the minimum reduction rates of Br\u207b and BrO(3)(-) were 38.5% and 73.2%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Microbial Culture Collection and Application, Guangdong Open Laboratory of Applied Microbiology, State Key Laboratory of Applied Microbiology (Ministry-Guangdong Province Jointly Breeding Base), South China, Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, 510070 Guangzhou, China E-mail: wuqp203@163.com; College of Food and Biological Engineering, Xuchang University, 461000 Xuchang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yong-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Microbial Culture Collection and Application, Guangdong Open Laboratory of Applied Microbiology, State Key Laboratory of Applied Microbiology (Ministry-Guangdong Province Jointly Breeding Base), South China, Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, 510070 Guangzhou, China E-mail: wuqp203@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qing-Ping", "Initials": "QP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Microbial Culture Collection and Application, Guangdong Open Laboratory of Applied Microbiology, State Key Laboratory of Applied Microbiology (Ministry-Guangdong Province Jointly Breeding Base), South China, Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, 510070 Guangzhou, China E-mail: wuqp203@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ju-Mei", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Microbial Culture Collection and Application, Guangdong Open Laboratory of Applied Microbiology, State Key Laboratory of Applied Microbiology (Ministry-Guangdong Province Jointly Breeding Base), South China, Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, 510070 Guangzhou, China E-mail: wuqp203@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Hua", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Water Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101185420", "ISSNLinking": "1477-8920"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mineral Waters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mineral Waters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25719467", "10.2166/wh.2014.084"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
