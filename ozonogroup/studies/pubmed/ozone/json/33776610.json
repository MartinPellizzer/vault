While declines of most air pollutants have been globally evidenced in most cities worldwide, there is few detailed spatial knowledge at local scale. Therefore, we present here a high resolution mapping of the 2018-2020 evolution of human activities and air pollutants in Wuhan. Human activities were assessed by nighttime\u00a0light\u00a0radiance. We measured the air quality index (AQI) as the maximum value among air quality sub-indices of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>3</sub> and particulate matter. We also compared mean monthly pollutant concentration during January-April in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Mapping results show that variations of nighttime light radiance were heterogenous at local scale, showing both rises and declines in the same district. The radiance decreased in eight districts located mostly in the city center, as a result of lower human activity, but the radiance increased in the five surrounding districts, as a consequence of people staying at home. AQI was low during lockdown, averaging at 57, but showed strong daily variations with a slight pollution around February 5 with AQI rising to 126. During this pollution event, particulate matter, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO levels were positively correlated, suggesting common sources, but were not correlated with ozone; and particulate matter, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO decreased with relative humidity, suggesting removal by precipitation. Comparison of 2020 data with previous years shows that particulate matter and NO<sub>2</sub> were highly reduced, CO was less reduced due to ongoing power industries, SO<sub>2</sub> first declined then increased to exceed 2018-19 values due to coal combustion, and ozone levels was more abundant due both to less NO<sub>x</sub> pollution and the weekend effect.", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10311-021-01222-x."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7092-1575"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.13402.34", "0000 0004 1759 700X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Land Management, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058 People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.260478.f"], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control (AEMPC), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, 210044 People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.8547.e", "0000 0001 0125 2443"], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433 People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.13402.34", "0000 0004 1759 700X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Land Management, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058 People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yuyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.13402.34", "0000 0004 1759 700X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Land Management, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058 People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.13402.34", "0000 0004 1759 700X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Land Management, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058 People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chengjie", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.43169.39", "0000 0001 0599 1243"], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049 People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yueshe", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8535-8073"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.43169.39", "0000 0001 0599 1243"], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049 People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.4399.7", "0000000122879528"], "Affiliation": "Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, INRA, Coll France, CEREGE, Aix en Provence, 13100 France."}], "LastName": "Lichtfouse", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Chem Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101220458", "ISSNLinking": "1610-3653"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestsThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest in this work."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bao R, Zhang A.
