In this paper, the possibility of using pre-ozonation instead of post-ozonation for the removal of micropollutants was explored because of the lower risk of forming carcinogenic bromate. A 1.0\u00a0m<sup>3</sup>/h pilot system was utilized to compare the efficacy of pre- and post-ozonation in the removal of bulk organic pollutants as well as micropollutants, including typical odor-causing compounds, pharmaceuticals, and typical pesticides, from one source water (Huangpu River) characterized by the occurrence of various micropollutants. Both pre-ozonation and post-ozonation could achieve similar water purification performance under an ozone dose of 1.5\u00a0mg/L, in terms of bulk water quality parameters like COD<sub>Mn</sub> (66% in combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment, compared to 62% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) or micropollutants including 27 pharmaceuticals (85% in combination with BAC compared to 87% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) and 25 pesticides (72% in combination with BAC compared to 61% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination). Pre-ozonation exhibited slightly better odorant removal performance (100% in combination with BAC compared to 92% with the post-ozonation-BAC combination); however, post-ozonation generated approximately 6.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L bromate at an ozone dose of 2.0\u00a0mg/L, while pre-ozonation did not form bromate even at an ozone dose as high as 3.0\u00a0mg/L. So pre-ozonation in combination with BAC might be a solution for the removal of micropollutants from source water with high bromate formation risk. The results of this study will be helpful for the optimization of ozonation processes in the water supply industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
