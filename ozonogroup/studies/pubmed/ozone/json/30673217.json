This study revealed the alteration of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) profiles, their co-occurrence with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and potential hosts during drinking water disinfection based on metagenomic assembly. We found the ozone/chlorine (O<sub>3</sub>/Cl<sub>2</sub>) coupled disinfection significantly increased the relative abundance of ARGs and MGE-carrying antibiotic resistance contigs (ARCs) through the enrichment of ARGs within the resistance-nodulation-cell division and ATP-binding cassette antibiotic efflux families that are primarily carried by Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium, and Methylocystis, whereas the antimicrobial resin/chlorine coupled disinfection posed unremarkable changes to the ARG and MGE abundances. Moreover, the co-occurrence patterns of antibiotic efflux and beta-lactam ARGs and MGEs were widely identified, and ARCs carrying the recR and mexH genes were detected in all the samples, with the highest abundance of 2.25 \u00d7 10<sup>-2</sup> copies per cell after O<sub>3</sub>/Cl<sub>2</sub> disinfection. Sequence-independent binning analysis successfully retrieved two draft ARG-carrying genomes of Acidovorax sp. MR-S7 and Hydrogenophaga sp. IBVHS2, further revealing the host-ARG relationship during O<sub>3</sub>/Cl<sub>2</sub> disinfection. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the antibiotic resistome alteration during drinking water disinfection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment , Nanjing University , 163 Xianlin Avenue , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Huaicheng", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment , Nanjing University , 163 Xianlin Avenue , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Fangyu", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment , Nanjing University , 163 Xianlin Avenue , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3333-0458"], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment , Nanjing University , 163 Xianlin Avenue , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4682-8917"], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment , Nanjing University , 163 Xianlin Avenue , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3957-7408"], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment , Nanjing University , 163 Xianlin Avenue , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment , Nanjing University , 163 Xianlin Avenue , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Aimin", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metagenomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30673217", "10.1021/acs.est.8b05907"]}}]}
