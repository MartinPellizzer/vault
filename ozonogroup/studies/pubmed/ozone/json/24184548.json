In this study, we examined for the first time the partitioning of infectious prions in rendering plant wastewater and found that a large proportion of infectious prions were partitioned into the scum layer formed at the top after gravity separation, while quite a few infectious prions still remained in the wastewater. Subsequently, we assessed the ozone inactivation of infectious prions in the raw, natural gravity-separated and dissolved air flotation (DAF)-treated (i.e., primary-treated) rendering plant wastewater, and in a municipal final effluent (i.e., secondary-treated municipal wastewater). At applied ozone doses of 43.4-44.6 mg/L, ozone was instantaneously depleted in the raw rendering plant wastewater, while a greater than 4-log10 inactivation was achieved at a 5 min exposure in the DAF-treated rendering plant wastewater. Prion inactivation in the municipal final effluent was conducted with two levels of applied ozone doses of 13.4 and 22.5mg/L, and a greater than 4-log10 inactivation was achieved at a 5 min exposure with the higher ozone dose. Efficiency factor Hom (EFH) models were used to model (i.e., fit) the experimental data. The CT (disinfectant concentration multiplied by contact time) values were determined for 2- and 3-log10 inactivation in the municipal final effluent treated with an ozone dose of 13.4 mg/L. Our results indicate that ozone could serve as a final barrier for prion inactivation in primary- and/or secondary-treated wastewaters."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Provincial Laboratory for Public Health, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Neumann", "ForeName": "Norman F", "Initials": "NF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Price", "ForeName": "Luke M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Braithwaite", "ForeName": "Shannon L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Balachandran", "ForeName": "Aru", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Belosevic", "ForeName": "Miodrag", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
