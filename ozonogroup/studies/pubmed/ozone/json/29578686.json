The ability to bond two or more pieces of molded silicone is important for creating microfluidic channels, chambers for pneumatically driven soft robotics, and other soft and stretchable devices. Sylgard-184 is a popular silicone, particularly for microfluidic applications. However, its low elongation at break (\u223c100% strain) and moderate tear strength (\u223c3 N/mm) make it unsuitable for emerging, mechanically demanding applications of silicone. In contrast, commercial silicones, such as Dragon Skin, have excellent mechanical properties yet are difficult to plasma-bond, likely because of the presence of silicone oils that soften the network yet migrate to the surface and interfere with plasma bonding. We found that extracting silicone oligomers from these soft networks allows these materials to bond but only when the Shore hardness exceeds a value of 15 A. It is also possible to mix highly stretchable silicones (Dragon Skin and Ecoflex) with Sylgard-184 to create silicones with intermediate mechanical properties; interestingly, these blends also only bond when the hardness exceeds 15 A. Eight different Pt-cured silicones were also screened; again, only those with Shore hardness above 15 A plasma-bond. The most promising silicones from this study are Sylgard-186 and Elastosil-M4130 and M4630, which exhibit a large deformation (>200% elongation at break), high tear strength (>12 N/mm), and strong plasma bonding. To illustrate the utility of these silicones, we created stretchable electrodes by injecting a liquid metal into microchannels created using such silicones, which may find use in soft robotics, electronic skin, and stretchable energy storage devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , North Carolina State University , 911 Partners Way , Raleigh , North Carolina 27695 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sungjune", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , North Carolina State University , 911 Partners Way , Raleigh , North Carolina 27695 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mondal", "ForeName": "Kunal", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , North Carolina State University , 911 Partners Way , Raleigh , North Carolina 27695 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Treadway", "ForeName": "Robert M", "Initials": "RM", "Suffix": "3rd"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , North Carolina State University , 911 Partners Way , Raleigh , North Carolina 27695 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Vikash", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Sciences Group , Microsoft Corporation , Redmond 98052 , Washington , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Siyuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Sciences Group , Microsoft Corporation , Redmond 98052 , Washington , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holbery", "ForeName": "James D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , North Carolina State University , 911 Partners Way , Raleigh , North Carolina 27695 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1251-1871"], "LastName": "Dickey", "ForeName": "Michael D", "Initials": "MD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29578686", "10.1021/acsami.7b18394"]}}]}
