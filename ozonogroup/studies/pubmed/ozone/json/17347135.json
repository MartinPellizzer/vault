Investigations into these complaints have ascribed the effects to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from building materials, cleaning formulations, or other consumer products. New compounds can result when the VOCs react with hydroxyl or nitrate radicals or ozone present in indoor environments. Several oxygenated organic compounds, such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal, glycolaldehyde, and diacetyl, have been identified as possible reaction products of indoor environment chemistry. Although research has previously identified diacetyl and glyoxal as sensitizers, additional experiments were conducted in these studies to further classify their sensitization potential. Sensitization potential of these four compounds was assessed using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) programs. Derek for Windows and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health logistic regression predicted all compounds to be sensitizers, while TOPKAT 6.2 predicted all compounds except for methylglyoxal. All compounds were tested in a combined irritancy and local lymph node assay (LLNA). All compounds except for glyoxal were found to be irritants and all tested positive in the LLNA with EC3 values ranging from 0.42 to 1.9%. Methylglyoxal significantly increased both the B220(+) and IgE(+)B220(+) cell populations in the draining lymph nodes and total serum IgE levels. The four compounds generated by indoor air chemistry were predicted by QSAR and animal modeling to be sensitizers, with the potential for methylglyoxal to induce IgE. The identification of these compounds as sensitizers may help to explain some of the health effects associated with indoor air complaints."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA. sanderson4@cdc.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Stacey E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wells", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fedorowicz", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Butterworth", "ForeName": "Leon F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meade", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Munson", "ForeName": "Albert E", "Initials": "AE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Irritants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50NP6JJ975", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyoxal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "722KLD7415", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GO1N1ZPR3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K324J5K4HM", "NameOfSubstance": "Diacetyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W0A0XPU08U", "NameOfSubstance": "glycolaldehyde"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Food Chem Toxicol. 2014 Aug;70:262-3. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2014.05.014", "PMID": "24857816"}, {"RefSource": "Food Chem Toxicol. 2014 Aug;70:260-1. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2014.05.013", "PMID": "24857818"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Contact"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Diacetyl"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ear, External"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Glyoxal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Irritants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymph Nodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17347135", "10.1093/toxsci/kfm043", "kfm043"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
