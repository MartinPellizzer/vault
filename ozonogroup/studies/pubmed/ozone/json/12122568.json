It is yet unknown whether inflammatory and biochemical effects in lower airways of humans, as observed upon single O(3) exposure, also show a diminutive response following repeated exposure to O(3). The aim of this study was to investigate inflammatory, permeability, and histopathological responses in lungs of rats following repeated daily O(3) exposure and to study the time course of attenuation and recovery of these effects using single O(3) challenges at various postexposure times. To aid in animal-to-human extrapolation, this study and a previously reported human study (Devlin et al., 1997) were designed with similar protocols. Wistar rats were exposed for 5 consecutive days to 0.4 ppm O(3) for 12 h/night. Subsequently, the time course of postexposure recovery was determined by a single challenge of 12 h to 0.4 ppm O(3) after a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-day recovery period. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) examination and histopathology were performed 12 h after this O(3) challenge. To quantify the magnitude of the O(3) response, results were compared with a group exposed only once for 12 h to 0.4 ppm O(3) and sacrificed simultaneously. The results demonstrate that a single exposure of 0.4 ppm O(3) causes marked permeability and inflammatory responses in lower airways of rats, as evidenced by enhanced BAL fluid levels of proteins, fibronectin, interleukin (IL)-6, and inflammatory cells. However, 5 days of exposure to 0.4 ppm O(3) for 12 h/night resulted in a complete disappearance of these responses, resulting in BAL fluid values that were not different from those observed in unexposed controls. Postexposure analyses of pulmonary response to O(3) challenges demonstrated that these attenuated responses show a gradual recovery. The data indicate that with respect to BAL fluid levels of albumin, IL-6, and number of macrophages and neutrophils, the period for lung tissue to regain its full susceptibility and responsiveness to O(3) following a 5-day preexposure period is approximately 15-20 days. Remarkably, the total protein and fibronectin responses in BAL fluid still exhibited an attenuated response to an O(3) challenge at 20 days postexposure. Morphometry (number of BrdU-labeled cells in terminal bronchiolar epithelium, and number of alveolar macrophages) showed that after a recovery of 5-10 days following a 5-day preexposure the response to a challenge was identical to that after a single exposure. These results suggest that complete repair from lower airway inflammation caused by short-term, repeated exposure to O(3) may take longer than previously assumed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Health Effects Research, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, PO Box 1, 3720 BA Bilthoven, the Netherlands.
