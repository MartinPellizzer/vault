Despite of the effective removal of nitrogen by DNF, the influence of DNF stage on the operation of UF was still unclear. In this study, a laboratory filtration system was used to investigate the membrane fouling potential of DNF effluent and the fouling control of ozonation. The membrane fouling potential was proved to be increased significantly after DNF stage and alleviated with ozonation treatment. With the help of UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and molecular weight (MW) analysis, the change of DOM component characteristics was proved to be in accordance with the change of fouling potential. The water samples were further fractionated into six hydrophobic/hydrophilic acidic/basic/neutral fractions, among which hydrophobic acids (HOA) and hydrophobic neutrals (HON) dominated the membrane fouling potential of DNF effluent. Detailed study of each fraction revealed that higher MW components in HOA and HON played a crucial role in the fouling of UF membrane. The dominant component of membrane fouling could be degraded and removed by ozonation, and therefore significant fouling alleviation was achieved. These results indicated that in the process of wastewater reclamation, besides conventional water quality indexes, more detailed water features should also be taken into consideration to optimize the whole process. Moreover, the control effects by ozonation could be monitored simply according to the change of specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and fluorescence intensity as surrogates in engineering applications. According to these results, a modified DNF-O<sub>3</sub>-UF process with O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 3\u00a0mg/L was proposed simply by reversing the sequence of UF and O<sub>3</sub> with no more infrastructure. This modified DNF-O<sub>3</sub>-UF process was expected to enlarge the produce capacity of reclaimed water with much lower electricity costs and chemical consumption."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
