Furthermore, while sleep occupies one-third of life, research on the health consequences of O<sub>3</sub> exposure during this crucial period is scarce. This study aimed to investigate associations of indoor O<sub>3</sub> during sleep with cardiorespiratory function and potential predisposing factors. A prospective study among 81 adults was conducted in Beijing, China. Repeated measurements of cardiorespiratory indices reflecting lung function, airway inflammation, cardiac autonomic function, blood pressure, systemic inflammation, platelet and glucose were performed on each subject. Real-time concentrations of indoor O<sub>3</sub> during sleep were monitored. Associations of O<sub>3</sub> with cardiorespiratory indices were evaluated using linear mixed-effect model. Effect modification by baseline lifestyles (diet, physical activity, sleep-related factors) and psychological status (stress and depression) were investigated through interaction analysis. The average indoor O<sub>3</sub> concentration during sleep was 20.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, which was well below current Chinese indoor air quality standard of 160\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. O<sub>3</sub> was associated with most respiratory indicators of decreased airway function except airway inflammation; whereas the cardiovascular effects were only manifested in autonomic dysfunction and not in others. An interquartile range increases in O<sub>3</sub> at 6-h average was associated with changes of -3.60\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: -6.19\u00a0%, -0.93\u00a0%) and -9.60\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: -14.53\u00a0%, -4.39\u00a0%) in FVC and FEF<sub>25</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>75</sub>, respectively. Further, stronger effects were noted among participants with specific dietary patterns, poorer sleep and higher level of depression. This study provides the first general population-based evidence that low-level exposure to indoor O<sub>3</sub> during sleep has greater effects on the respiratory system than on the cardiovascular system. Our findings identify the respiratory system as an important target for indoor O<sub>3</sub> exposure, and particularly highlight the need for greater awareness of indoor air quality, especially during sleep."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
