Ground-observed meteorological and pollutant data as well as the chemical compositions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated. The results showed that the six parameters of pollutants in the safeguard period in 2019 indicated a downward trend as compared with that during the same time in 2018, and the average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were decreased by 16.2% and 25.1%, respectively. However, the average concentration of O<sub>3</sub> was only reduced by 3.7%. The daily proportions of primary pollutants of O<sub>3</sub> increased to 90% during the NTGEM, and the ozone pollution was severe in this period. Meanwhile, the concentration of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) in the safeguard period was 26.21\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, which was significantly lower than that during the historical period. Six emission sources of the VOCs were identified using PMF model, including vehicle exhaust (28%), LPG evaporation (21%), combustion source (16%), industrial emissions (15%), solvent utilization (15%), and biogenic VOCs (5%). During the NTGEM period, the control of combustion sources and industrial sources was evident."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jin-Shuai", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Monitoring Center of Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Monitoring Center of Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Shuang-Liang", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Monitoring Center of Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei-Si", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yi-Dan", "Initials": "YD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33124375", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202002151"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
