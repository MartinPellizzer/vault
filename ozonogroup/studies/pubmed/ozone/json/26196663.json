Thus, we have investigated HBQ precursors in plant influents and their removal by each treatment before chlorination in nine DWTPs. The levels of HBQ precursors were determined using formation potential (FP) tests for 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ), 2,3,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ), 2,6-dichloro-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DCMBQ), and 2,6-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ). HBQ precursors were present in all plant influents. DCBQ precursors were the most abundant (DCBQ FP up to 205 ng/L). Coagulation removed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (up to 56%) and HBQ precursors (up to 39% for DCBQ). The level of removal of DOC was significantly greater than the level of removal of HBQ FP, suggesting that organic matter removed by coagulation had a high proportion of non-HBQ-precursor material. Granular activated carbon (GAC) decreased the level of HBQ FPs by 10-20%, where DOC removal was only 0.2-4.7%, suggesting that the GAC was not in the adsorption mode and biodegradation of HBQ precursors may have been occurring. Ozonation destroyed/transformed HBQ FPs by 10-30%, whereas anthracite/sand filtration and UV irradiation appeared to have no impact. The results demonstrated that the combined treatments did not substantially reduce HBQ precursor levels in water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G3."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G3."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Yichao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G3."}], "LastName": "Jmaiff", "ForeName": "Lindsay K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, 700 Moreno Avenue, La Verne, California 91750-3399, United States."}], "LastName": "Krasner", "ForeName": "Stuart W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G3."}], "LastName": "Hrudey", "ForeName": "Steve E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G3."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xing-Fang", "Initials": "XF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3T006GV98U", "NameOfSubstance": "quinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Quality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26196663", "10.1021/acs.est.5b02308"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
