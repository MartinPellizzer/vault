The ratio of volatile organic compounds to nitrogen oxides (VOCs/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) and the EKMA curve were studied to analyze the sensitivity of ozone formation. The results showed that:\u2460 The ozone generation rate and ozone concentrations were positively correlated with the solar radiation intensity with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.61 and 0.48, respectively. Both the ozone generation rate and the solar radiation intensity reached their peak at about 12:00, while the ozone concentration reached its peak at about 16:00, which lagged behind the peak of the solar radiation intensity by 4 h. \u2461 The correlation coefficient between the ozone generation rate and the temperature was 0.44, between the ozone concentration and temperature was 0.68. The ozone generation rate and ozone concentrations were inversely correlated with total cloud cover with correlation coefficients of -0.24 and -0.45, respectively. \u2462 The ozone concentrations in Langfang were high when the winds were from the west, south, or southeast. \u2463 The ozone concentrations in Langfang were more sensitive to VOCs than to NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>; thus, they can be reduced efficiently by controlling the VOCs emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Bureau of Environmental Protection, Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Ecology Industrialization for Wisdom Environment(Langfang), Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yu-Mei", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Bureau of Environmental Protection, Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xu-Guang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Bureau of Environmental Protection, Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Bureau of Environmental Protection, Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Ecology Industrialization for Wisdom Environment(Langfang), Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Li-Yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Ecology Industrialization for Wisdom Environment(Langfang), Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Huai-Rui", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Langfang Bureau of Meteorology, Langfang 065000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qing-Chuan", "Initials": "QC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965193", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201703270"]}}]}
