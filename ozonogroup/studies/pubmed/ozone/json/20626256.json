This study researches the influence of Ozone Oxidative Pre-conditioning (OOP) in unbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant activity generated in liver and lung during a process of sepsis. The study was conducted on male rats. Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of fecal material and pre-treatment with ozone/oxygen mixture was administered before fecal material injection. Activities of catalase, glutathione peroxide, and superoxide dismutase were measured, as well as conjugated dienes (CD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were estimated. The results demonstrated that OOP not cause oxidative damage. It reduced levels of pro-oxidant biomarkers in lung and liver, with decreased total pro-oxidant activity and elevated total antioxidant activity from a system for diagnosis of oxidative stress in both tissues. These results suggest that OOP protected liver and lung for oxidative stress in septic shock."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedicine, Ozone Research Center, 15 street, corners 230, Siboney, Playa, Havana City, Cuba. dailen.guanche@cnic.edu.cu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guanche", "ForeName": "Dailen", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hernandez", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zamora", "ForeName": "Zullyt", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alonso", "ForeName": "Yaima", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Mech Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101134521", "ISSNLinking": "1537-6516"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Premedication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Shock, Septic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20626256", "10.3109/15376516.2010.497980"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
