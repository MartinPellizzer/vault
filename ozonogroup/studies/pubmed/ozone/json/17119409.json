Agreement exists that these drugs can initiate vascular endothelial cell damage and accelerate disturbances in the microcirculation of the jaws, possibly resulting in thrombosis of nutrient-end arteries. The role of bisphosphonates in cancer patients with previously treated jaws has yet to be elucidated. The signs and symptoms that may occur before the appearance of evident osteonecrosis include changes in the health of periodontal tissues, nonhealing mucosal ulcers, loose teeth and unexplained soft tissue infection. A series of 30 periodontally involved patients showing osteonecrosis of the jaws that appeared following the intravenous use of bisphosphonates is reported. Clinical management of the avascular necrosis of the jaws in patients treated with bisphosphonates presents several problems. An analysis of the international medical literature shows that surgical treatment of the necrotic jaws in patients treated with bisphosphonates has proven to be ineffective in stopping the pathological process. The use of hyperbaric oxygen and antibiotics are not effective, either. The authors have developed a new protocol for the management of these lesions. Compared with other therapeutic choices, this protocol has introduced the use of ozone therapy as therapeutic support."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery, University of Rome \"La Sapienza,\" Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrillo", "ForeName": "Alessandro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrucci", "ForeName": "Maria Teresa", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tedaldi", "ForeName": "Massimiliano", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustazza", "ForeName": "Maria Cristina", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marino", "ForeName": "Simone Maria Faustino", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallucci", "ForeName": "Cristiano", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iannetti", "ForeName": "Giorgio", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Craniofac Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "9010410", "ISSNLinking": "1049-2275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diphosphonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diphosphonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Jaw Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteonecrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17119409", "10.1097/01.scs.0000249350.59096.d0", "00001665-200611000-00011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
