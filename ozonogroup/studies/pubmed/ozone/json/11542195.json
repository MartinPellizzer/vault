Formed after the eruption, the volcanic aerosol cloud, with a peak particle density at 27 km, was very efficient at altering the radiation field. The results of a one-dimensional radiative transfer model show that the total radiation increased by 8% within the aerosol layer longward of 3000 angstroms. At certain altitudes and wavelengths below 3000 angstroms, the total radiation decreased by 15%. Consequently, there are changes in the photolysis rates obtained with a one-dimensional photochemical model: for example, O2 photodissociation rate constants decrease by 10%, while O3 photodissociation rate constants increase by a comparable amount. A combination of this radiation change and the effect of a temperature variation of a few degrees causes the abundance of O3 to decrease by 7% at 24 km, in good agreement with the Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet experiment (SBUV) measurements of a 5-10% decrease. The combined radiative and thermal perturbations on the concentrations of O, O(1 D), OH, HO2, H2O2, NO, NO2, NO3, N2O5, HNO3, HO2NO2, Cl, ClO, ClO2, HOCl, ClNO3, and HCl are computed and presented in detail. However, these changes as calculated are insufficient to explain the observations of significant decreases in NO and NO2 and increases in HCl. A heterogeneous reaction catalyzed by aerosol surfaces which transforms ClNO3 into HCl provides a pathway for sequestering NOx, and at the same time reduces ClNO3 in favor of HCL. The inclusion of this reaction in the model leads to a satisfactory single-step explanation of the otherwise puzzling observations of NO, NO2, and HCl. The observed lack of change in HNO3 cannot be explained by this hypothesis. The effects of a number of heterogeneous reactions, some believed to be important for the Antarctic stratosphere, have been assessed with our model. We also examine the hypothesis of direct injection of gases from the volcano into the stratosphere. Only an unrealistically large injection (60% column increase above 12 km) results in an HCl increase in agreement with observations. An equally large water injection decreases HCl, and decreases the NO and NO2 by as much as 20%, but still does not simulate the observed NOx decrease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michelangeli", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yung", "ForeName": "Y L", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Geophys Res", "NlmUniqueID": "100971480", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0227"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QTT17582CB", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrochloric Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrochloric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solar Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volcanic Eruptions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11542195", "10.1029/jd094id15p18429"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
