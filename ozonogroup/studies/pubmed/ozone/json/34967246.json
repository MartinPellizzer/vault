A continuous experiment then confirmed the effectiveness of the process for SAARB effluent treatment. In a batch experiment, the effects of influencing factors, including nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> dosage, O<sub>3</sub> dosage and initial pH on the treatment performance of nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> process, were comprehensively investigated. The results showed that when the nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> dosage\u2009=\u20096\u2009g\u2009L<sup>-1</sup>, O<sub>3</sub> dosage\u2009=\u20090.15\u2009L\u2009minute<sup>-1</sup> and initial pH\u2009=\u20097, the total organic carbon, absorbance at 254\u2009nm and colour number removal efficiencies were 40.58%, 62.55% and 89.80%, respectively. In addition, most of the humic- and fulvic-like substances in the SAARB effluent were removed, and the condensation degree, aromaticity and humification degree of the organics were substantially reduced. The morphology and elemental valence state analysis showed that the nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in the process was relatively stable and could form an nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-organic complex. Therefore, the probability of organics reacting with hydroxyl radical increased and the oxidation efficiency was enhanced. In the continuous experiment, both the O<sub>3</sub> dosage and hydraulic retention time (HRT) were the key influencing factors. The treatment efficiency of the nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> process was enhanced at a higher O<sub>3</sub> dosage and longer HRT. The electrical energy consumption of the continuous nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> process was calculated to be 17.72\u2009kW\u2009h\u2009m<sup>-3</sup> in SAARB effluent treatment. This study proved the feasibility of biologically treated landfill leachate treatment by the nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4130-5447"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yuyu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9881064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1K09F3G675", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garbage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34967246", "10.1177/0734242X211066229"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
