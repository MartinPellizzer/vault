The obtained rate coefficients were found to be independent of pressure under these conditions. The obtained rate coefficients for the reaction of Cl-atom with ( E)- and ( Z)-CF<sub>3</sub>CF\u2550CFCF<sub>3</sub> at 296 K were k<sub>1</sub>(296 K) = (7.23 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and k<sub>2</sub>(296 K) = (6.70 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with the temperature dependence described by the Arrhenius expressions: k<sub>1</sub>( T) = (3.47 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> exp[(210 \u00b1 25)/ T] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and k<sub>2</sub>( T) = (3.37 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> exp[(199 \u00b1 25)/ T] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The rate coefficients for the OH radical reaction with ( E)- and ( Z)-CF<sub>3</sub>CF\u2550CFCF<sub>3</sub> were found to be k<sub>3</sub>(296-375 K) = (4.34 \u00b1 0.45) \u00d7 10<sup>-13</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and k<sub>4</sub>(296-375 K) = (3.30 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10<sup>-13</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The quoted rate coefficient uncertainties are 2\u03c3 (95% confidence level) and include estimated systematic errors. The rate coefficients for the reaction of OH with a mixture of the two stereoisomers were determined using a pulsed laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique for comparison with previous kinetic measurements using stereoisomer mixtures. The effective rate coefficient for the 0.7/0.3 ( E)/( Z) stereoisomer sample was found to be nearly independent of temperature over the range 222-375 K with a value of (4.47 \u00b1 0.36) \u00d7 10<sup>-13</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The atmospheric lifetimes for ( E)- and ( Z)-CF<sub>3</sub>CF\u2550CFCF<sub>3</sub> due to OH-reactive loss are estimated to be 25 and 35 days, respectively. The lifetime-corrected radiative efficiencies (W m<sup>-2</sup> ppb<sup>-1</sup>) and 100 year time horizon global warming potentials derived in this work are 0.05 and 1.2 for ( E)-CF<sub>3</sub>CF\u2550CFCF<sub>3</sub> and 0.13 and 4.1 for ( Z)-CF<sub>3</sub>CF\u2550CFCF<sub>3</sub>. The photochemical ozone creation potentials for ( E)- and ( Z)-CF<sub>3</sub>CF\u2550CFCF<sub>3</sub> are estimated to be 2.5 and 2.1, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Research Laboratory, Chemical Sciences Division , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , 325 Broadway , Boulder , Colorado 80305-3328 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , University of Colorado , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2320-8333"], "LastName": "Baasandorj", "ForeName": "Munkhbayar", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Research Laboratory, Chemical Sciences Division , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , 325 Broadway , Boulder , Colorado 80305-3328 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , University of Colorado , Boulder , Colorado 80309 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Papadimitriou", "ForeName": "Vassileios C", "Initials": "VC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Research Laboratory, Chemical Sciences Division , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , 325 Broadway , Boulder , Colorado 80305-3328 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9532-6246"], "LastName": "Burkholder", "ForeName": "James B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31117596", "10.1021/acs.jpca.9b03095"]}}]}
