A spate of meetings and agreements in recent months has shown many international governments to be more willing than ever to try to limit the amount of their air pollution that drifts into other countries. Prompting this policy shift are increasing emissions in some parts of the world, better monitoring, and an improved understanding of air pollution transport and the effects of air pollution. In most regions of the world, however, no international agreements on air pollution exist at all, while in others, many overlapping local, multilateral, and global agreements address the problem simultaneously. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution causes nearly 3 million deaths per year, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that ground-level ozone causes damage to U.S. crops totaling $1-2 billion each year."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reuther", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10753105", "PMC1638028", "10.1289/ehp.108-a170", "sc271_5_1835"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
