We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the mean effect of environmental factors associated to climate change (warming, drought, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> , and O<sub>3</sub> ) on the emission of isoprene and MTs. Results indicated that all single factors except warming inhibited isoprene emission. When subsets of data collected in experiments run under similar change of a given environmental factor were compared, isoprene and photosynthesis responded negatively to elevated O<sub>3</sub> (-8% and -10%, respectively) and drought (-15% and -42%), and in opposite ways to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (-23% and +55%) and warming (+53% and -23%, respectively). Effects on MTs emission were usually not significant, with the exceptions of a significant stimulation caused by warming (+39%) and by elevated O<sub>3</sub> (limited to O<sub>3</sub> -insensitive plants, and evergreen species with storage organs). Our results clearly highlight individual effects of environmental factors on isoprene and MT emissions, and an overall uncoupling between these secondary metabolites produced by the same methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway. Future results from manipulative experiments and long-term observations may help untangling the interactive effects of these factors and filling gaps featured in the current meta-analysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9775-5113"], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhaozhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xiangyang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA), Research Centre for Forestry and Wood, Arezzo, 52100, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fares", "ForeName": "Silvano", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Agriculture and Food Sciences (DISBA), National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Rome, 00185, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University Federico II, Naples, 80138, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loreto", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pin", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, Sesto Fiorentino (Florence), 50019, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoshika", "ForeName": "Yasutomo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, Sesto Fiorentino (Florence), 50019, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paoletti", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butadienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0A62964IBU", "NameOfSubstance": "isoprene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butadienes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30767225", "10.1111/pce.13535"]}}]}
