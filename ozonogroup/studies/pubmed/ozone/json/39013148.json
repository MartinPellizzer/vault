Herein, the solvation and reactive uptake of three stable isomers of chlorine trioxide (Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), namely, ClOCl(O)O, ClClO<sub>3</sub>, and ClOOOCl, at the air-water interface were investigated using classical and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) coupled with advanced free energy methods. Two distinct mechanisms were revealed for the hydrolysis of ClOCl(O)O and ClClO<sub>3</sub>: molecular and ionic mechanisms. A comparison of the computed free-energy profiles for the gaseous and air-water interfacial systems indicated that the air-water interface could markedly lower the free-energy barrier for <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msubsup><mrow><mi>ClO</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo></mrow></msubsup></math> or HClO<sub>3</sub> formation while stabilizing the product state. In particular, the hydrolysis of ClClO<sub>3</sub> at the air-water interface was barrierless. In contrast, our calculations showed that the hydrolysis of ClOOOCl was very slow, indicating that ClOOOCl was inert to water at the air-water interface. This study provides theoretical evidence for the hypothesis that HClO<sub>3</sub> is a sink for chlorine oxides and for the widespread distributions of HClO<sub>3</sub> recently observed in the Arctic region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Nanoscience, CAS Key Laboratory of Nanosystem and Hierarchical Fabrication, CAS Centre for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Centre for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing 100190, PR China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Ye-Guang", "Initials": "YG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, PR China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Laiyang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5461-1486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8316-1816"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chongqin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1668-465X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, PR China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Wei-Hai", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39013148", "10.1021/jacs.4c06269"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
