The rate coefficient values (in cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) determined for the three compounds are linalool, k(O3) = (4.1 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10(-16) and k(OH) = (1.7 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10(-10); 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol, k(O3) = (3.8 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10(-16) and k(OH) = (1.0 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10(-10); and 3-methyl-1-penten-3-ol, k(O3) = (5.2 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10(-18) and k(OH) = (6.2 \u00b1 1.8) \u00d7 10(-11). From the kinetic data it is estimated that, for the reaction of O(3) with linalool, attack at the R-CH\u2550C(CH(3))(2) group represents around (93 \u00b1 52)% (k(6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol)/k(linalool)) of the overall reaction, with reaction at the R-CH\u2550CH(2) group accounting for about (1.3 \u00b1 0.5)% (k(3-methyl-1-penten-3-ol)/k(linalool)). In a similar manner it has been calculated that for the reaction of OH radicals with linalool, attack of the OH radical at the R-CH\u2550C(CH(3))(2) group represents around (59 \u00b1 18)% (k(6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol)/k(linalool)) of the total reaction, while addition of OH to the R-CH\u2550CH(2) group is estimated to be around (36 \u00b1 6)% (k(3-methyl-1-penten-3-ol)/k(linalool)). Analysis of the products from the reaction of O(3) with linalool confirmed that addition to the R-CH\u2550C(CH(3))(2) group is the predominant reaction pathway. The presence of formaldehyde and hydroxyacetone in the reaction products together with compelling evidence for the generation of OH radicals in the system indicates that the hydroperoxide channel is important in the loss of the biradical [(CH(3))(2)COO]* formed in the reaction of O(3) with linalool. Studies on the reactions of O(3) with the unsaturated alcohols showed that the yields of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) are higher in the absence of OH scavengers compared to the yields in their presence. However, even under low-NO(X) concentrations, the reactions of OH radicals with 3-methyl-1-penten-3-ol and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol will make only a minor contribution to SOA formation under atmospheric conditions. Relatively high yields of SOAs were observed in the reactions of OH with linalool, although the initial concentrations of reactants were quite high. The importance of linalool in the formation of SOAs in the atmosphere requires further investigation. The impact following releases of these unsaturated alcohols into the atmosphere are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICARE-CNRS and OSUC, 1C Avenue de la Recherche Scientifique, 45071 cedex 02 Orl\u00e9ans, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bernard", "ForeName": "Fran\u00e7ois", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Da\u00eble", "ForeName": "V\u00e9ronique", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "Abdelwahid", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sidebottom", "ForeName": "Howard", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-methyl-1-penten-3-ol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8JQ5607IO5", "NameOfSubstance": "Heptanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D81QY6I88E", "NameOfSubstance": "linalool"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Heptanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pentanols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22316013", "10.1021/jp211355d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
