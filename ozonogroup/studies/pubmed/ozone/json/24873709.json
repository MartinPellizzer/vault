Results indicated that ozonation of the n-alkanes in fine grain size sand (0.15-0.25 mm) was 1.2 times faster than coarse sand due to higher surface contact area between O3 and sand particles. Soil moisture below 18% w/w did not influence the ozonation efficiency. In contrast the ozonation led to an increase of acidity of the sand samples (pH=3.0) after 20 h treatment. This was due to the formation of carboxylic acid. Formaldehyde, one of the key by-products of ozonation, was always <13 mg kg(-1) after the treatment which is below the industrial soil clean-up target level. While the aldehydes and carboxylic acid further reacted with O3 and their ozonation rate were slower than those of the alkanes suggesting that the hydroxylated by-products accumulated in the sand during the process. Overall the findings demonstrated that not only the alkanes but also aldehydes and carboxylic acid should be considered when defining remediation end-points."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
