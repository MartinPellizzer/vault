Most studies have focussed on the effects of elevated ozone levels vs. present ambient. We investigated the effect of present ambient surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations vs. preindustrial on a range of agronomically important response variables in field-grown wheat, using results from 33 experiments (representing 9 countries, 3 continents, 17 cultivars plus one set of 4 cultivars) having both charcoal filtered (CF) and non-filtered (NF) air treatments. Average filtration efficiency was 62%, reducing the O<sub>3</sub> concentration from 35.6\u00b110.6SDppb in NF to 13.7\u00b18.8SDppb in CF. Average CF concentrations were in the range of levels believed to represent pre-industrial conditions, while NF concentrations were 7% lower than in the ambient air at plant height on the experimental sites. NF had significant (p<0.05) negative effects compared to CF on grain yield (-8.4%), grain mass (-3.7%), harvest index (-2.4%), total above-ground biomass (-5.4%), starch concentration (-3.0%), starch yield (-10.9%), and protein yield (-6.2%). No significant effect was found for grain number and protein concentration. There was a significant relationship between the effect of filtration on grain yield and the difference in O<sub>3</sub> concentration between NF and CF treatments. The average yield loss per ppb O<sub>3</sub> removed was 0.38% and did not systematically vary with year of experiment (ranging from 1982 to 2010) or with the average O<sub>3</sub> level in the experiments. Although there are many differences among the field experiments included in this meta-analysis (e.g. genotype, degree of O<sub>3</sub> pollution of the site and year, nutrient and soil condition, filtration efficiency), our study clearly shows that there is a consistent and significant effect of present ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposure on a range of important response variables in wheat, the most strongly affected being starch yield."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
