Dry deposition of NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+) to foliage of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) was correlated (R = 0.83-0.88) with historical average hourly O(3) concentations at 10 sites across an O(3) gradient in the SBNF. Mean deposition fluxes of NO(3)(-) to ponderosa and Jeffrey pine branches were 0.82 nmol M(-2)s(-1) at Camp Paivika (CP), a high-pollution site, and 0.19 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at Camp Osceola (CAO), a low-pollution site. Deposition fluxes of NH(4)(+) were 0.32 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at CP and 0.17 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at CAO, while mean values for SO(4)(2-) were 0.03 at CP and 0.02 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at CAO. Deposition fluxes to paper and nylon filters were higher in most cases than fluxes to pine branches at the same site. The results of this study suggest that an atmospheric concentration and deposition gradient of N and S compounds occurs along with the west-east O(3) gradient in the SBNF. Annual stand-level dry deposition rates for S and N at CP and CAO were estimated. Further studies are needed to determine if high N deposition loads in the SBNF significantly affect plant/soil nutrient relations, tree health, and the response of ponderosa pine to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experimental Station, USDA-FS, Forest Fire Laboratory, 4955 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, California 92507, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fenn", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bytnerowicz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091813", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90210-f", "026974919390210F"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
