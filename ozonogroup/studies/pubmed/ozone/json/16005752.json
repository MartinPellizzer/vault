The best representation has been in the conifers where some 20 species representing three genera have been studied. Overall, about 1/3 of these have demonstrated some deleterious response to UV-B. However, most negative impacts have been observed under controlled environment conditions where sensitivity may be enhanced. Therefore, it seems unlikely that expected levels of ozone depletion will result in direct losses in productivity. However, the role that ambient or enhanced levels of UV-B may play in forest ecosystem processes is more difficult to access. One possible indirect response of forests to changes in UV-B radiation levels could be via alterations in plant secondary metabolites. Increases in phenolics and flavonoids that enhance epidermal UV-screening effectiveness may also influence leaf development, water relations or ecosystem processes such as plant-herbivore interactions or decomposition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Resource Sciences and Landscape Architecture, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA. js128@umail.umd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sullivan", "ForeName": "Joe H", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acclimatization"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "82"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16005752", "10.1016/j.envpol.2005.01.029", "S0269-7491(05)00113-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
