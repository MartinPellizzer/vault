The catalyst was characterized by using various analytical techniques. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterization showed that the raw bauxite containing boehmite (gamma-AlOOH), kaolinite (Al(2)Si(2)O(5)(OH)(4)) and quartz (SiO(2)), and gamma-AlOOH was the major composition. The catalytic ozonation removal effectiveness of TCA was investigated under various physicochemical conditions. Both the adsorption and the single ozonation were not effective for the degradation of TCA, and the presence of the raw bauxite in ozonation enhanced the TCA removal effectiveness. Both the hydroxyl radicals (OH) scavenging experiment and R(ct) characterization confirmed that the generation of OH was accounted for the enhancement of the degradation of TCA. The generation of OH was inhibited faintly by the presence of both natural organic matters (NOMs) and alkalinity in the natural water during catalyzed ozonation with the raw bauxite. The increasing of both the bauxite dosage and the ozone dosage enhanced the removal effectiveness of TCA. The raw bauxite was an efficient green catalyst for TCA degradation in drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China. qifei_hit@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bingbing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhonglin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Dezhi", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Liqiu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Fengchang", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31O3X41254", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4,6-trichloroanisole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19272699", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.02.037", "S0304-3894(09)00218-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
