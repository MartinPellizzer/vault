Many of these rate coefficients are unknown--possibly resulting from the variety of these compounds and the inherent expense of deriving these data experimentally--and a reliable method for their prediction would therefore be of value to such models. This study presents a method for estimating rate coefficients for C(2)-C(10) olefins. Measured rate coefficients for the reaction of unsaturated hydrocarbons with OH and NO(3) radicals and O(3) are correlated with the Randi\u0107 topological descriptor and an established correlation parameter, i.e. ionization potentials calculated using the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) approach. Although the ionization potential method produces better correlations in general, OH correlations of aliphatic species, subdivided into groups of varying total number of primary (1 degree), secondary (2 degrees) and tertiary (3 degrees) carbon atoms (Sigma x degrees (x)) produced several new trends with the Randi\u0107 index that were not present in the ionization potential correlations. Strong correlation was observed with a Randi\u0107-type index optimized to include a term for side chain length (Sigma x degrees (x)). The presence of strong relationships, made predictable by molecular constitution, makes topological descriptors a useful and accessible tool for estimating rate coefficients for the reactions of OH with aliphatic species. This study indicates that alkene reactivity is affected strongly by constitution and that abstraction as well as addition may be important for some classes of compound."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, The Sackville Building, The University of Manchester, Sackville Street, P.O.
