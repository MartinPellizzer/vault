The structure of the catalysts was analyzed via X-ray diffraction (XRD), N<sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The mechanical properties of the catalysts were studied. The reaction kinetics model of O<sub>3</sub> alone and catalytic ozonation of the hydroquinone were established and catalytic ozonation performance of catalysts was investigated. The results showed that the crystal phase of Mn<sub>0</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>/CH belonged to CoAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and that the crystal phase of the Mn-Co/CH catalyst (Mn<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>, and Mn<sub>3</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>) mainly belonged to Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and CoO. In particular, the Mn<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>/CH catalyst had a large specific surface area of 190 m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>, high pore volume of 0.25 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>, and pore size of 4.8 nm. The highest catalytic activity was obtained when Mn\u2236Co was 1\u22361 (Mn<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>/CH catalyst). The catalytic activity of the Mn<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>/CH catalyst was the highest, and removal efficiencies of hydroquinone and COD were 78% and 54%, respectively, using Mn<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>/CH catalytic ozonation. The Mn-Co/CH catalyst had a high compressive strength (15.89-16.94 MPa). The degradation efficiency of hydroquinone decreased significantly after the addition of tert-butanol, which indicated that\u00b7OH played an important role in the Mn<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>/CH catalytic ozonation. The catalytic ozonation process fitted the first-order kinetic model. The apparent rate constant <i>k</i> for O<sub>3</sub> alone was only 0.0306. Furthermore, the Mn<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>/CH catalyst had the highest rate, with an apparent rate constant <i>k</i> of 0.0535 min<sup>-1</sup>. The Mn-Co/CH catalyst was easy to industrialize owing to its lower consumption, excellent catalytic characteristics, and long working life."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lan-He", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zi-Cheng", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hai-Feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Agro-Biotechnology Research Center, Beijing 100089, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xu-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29962143", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201711052"]}}]}
