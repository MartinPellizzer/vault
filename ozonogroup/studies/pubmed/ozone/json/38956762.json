Although catalytic ozonation effectively transforms DOM, increases in DBP formation potential are often observed due to the accumulation of aldehydes, ketones, and nitro compound intermediates during DOM transformation. In this study, we propose a novel strategy for the sequential oxidation of DOM, effectively reducing the levels of accumulation of these intermediates. This is achieved through the development of a catalyst with a tailored surface and nanoconfined active sites for catalytic ozonation. The catalyst features a unique confinement structure, wherein Mn-N<sub>4</sub> moieties are uniformly anchored on the catalyst surface and within nanopores (5-20 \u00c5). This design enables the degradation of the large molecular weight fraction of DOM on the catalyst surface, while the transformed smaller molecular weight fraction enters the nanopores and undergoes rapid degradation due to the confinement effect. The generation of *O<sub>ad</sub> as the dominant reactive species is essential for effectively reducing these ozone refractory intermediates. This resulted in over 70% removal of carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBP precursors as well as brominated DBP precursors. This study highlights the importance of the nanoscale sequential reactor design and provides new insights into eliminating DBP precursors by the catalytic ozonation process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Zilong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiaguang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Jingmeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0856-0865"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0326-5325"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Junlang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0120-6110"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Photochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xinran", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Qingqing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0006-6036-5513"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yangjian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9860-423X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38956762", "10.1021/acs.est.3c09295"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
