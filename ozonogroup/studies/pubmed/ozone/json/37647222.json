However, the chemical fate of such compounds has not been well characterized in genuine indoor environments. Here, we monitored the aging of oil coatings on glass surfaces over a range of environmental conditions, using mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Upon room air exposure (up to 17 ppb ozone), the characteristic ozonolysis products, secondary ozonides, were observed on surfaces near the cooking area of a commercial kitchen, along with condensed-phase aldehydes. In an office setting, ozonolysis is also the dominant degradation pathway for oil films exposed to air. However, for indoor enclosed spaces such as drawers, the depleted air flow makes lipid autoxidation more favorable after an induction period of a few days. Forming hydroperoxides as the major primary products, this radical-mediated peroxidation behavior is accelerated by indoor direct sunlight, but the initiation step in dark settings is still unclear. These results are in accord with radical measurements, indicating that indoor photooxidation facilitates radical formation on surfaces. Overall, many intermediate and end products observed are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may induce oxidative stress in human bodies. Given that these species can be widely found on both food and household surfaces, their toxicological properties are worth further attention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8310-9401"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zilin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada."}], "LastName": "Crilley", "ForeName": "Leigh R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6531-4412"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ditto", "ForeName": "Jenna C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8926-4237"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada."}], "LastName": "VandenBoer", "ForeName": "Trevor C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3372-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37647222", "10.1021/acs.est.3c04009"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
