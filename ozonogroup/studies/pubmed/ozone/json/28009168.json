The numerical method presented in this study provides an alternative means of estimating the uncertainties of previous GOM measurements. Weekly GOM in ambient air was predicted from measured weekly mercury wet deposition using a scavenging ratio approach, and compared against field measurements of 2-4 hly GOM to estimate the measurement biases of the Tekran speciation instruments at 13 Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet) sites. Multiyear average GOM measurements were estimated to be biased low by more than a factor of 2 at six sites, between a factor of 1.5 and 1.8 at six other sites, and below a factor of 1.3 at one site. The differences between predicted and observed were significantly larger during summer than other seasons potentially because of higher ozone concentrations that may interfere with GOM sampling. The analysis data collected over six years at multiple sites suggests a systematic bias in GOM measurements, supporting the need for further investigation of measurement technologies and identifying the chemical composition of GOM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9004-7325"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Science and Technology Branch, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4 Canada."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Irene", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5437-5412"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Science and Technology Branch, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4 Canada."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Leiming", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uncertainty"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28009168", "10.1021/acs.est.6b04926"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
