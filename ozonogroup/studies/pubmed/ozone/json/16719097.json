To better understand the effects of these properties on sorption, aqueous sorption isotherms for 14C-labeled phenanthrene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene were obtained for four soots of varying properties: two diesel reference soots, a hexane soot, and an ozonated hexane soot. Substantial isotherm nonlinearity was observed. In comparison to diesel soot SRM 2975, diesel soot SRM 1650b had a much higher content of extractable authigenic organic chemicals, showed less sorption of 14C-labeled sorbate at low relative concentrations (Ce/Sw), and showed higher sorption at high Ce/Sw. In comparison to normal hexane soot, the ozonated hexane soot had a higher surface O/C ratio and showed substantially less sorption at all concentrations studied. The sorption differences were attributed to the noted differences in properties, and results were interpreted through a dual-mode sorption model that included the possibility of both surface adsorption (modeled using a Polanyi-based approach) and simple phase partitioning (linear absorption). Generally, such modeling indicated that overall uptake at low concentrations in all four soots was dominated by surface adsorption but that sorption at higher sorbate concentrations in SRM 1650b was heavily influenced by linear absorption within the natively bound organic phase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North Charles Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21218, USA. thn@jhu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Thanh H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ball", "ForeName": "William P", "Initials": "WP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "05IQ959M1N", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2,4-trichlorobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "448J8E5BST", "NameOfSubstance": "phenanthrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Organic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hexanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16719097", "10.1021/es052121a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
