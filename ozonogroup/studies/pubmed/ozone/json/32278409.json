The most important characteristics of the sampler design is that simultaneous sampling of the three pollutants can be performed in one sampler. All the parts of the diffusive sampler are reusable after cleaning. These properties provide important advantages in terms of cost and practicality. Two alternative samplers, having long and short diffusion paths, have been designed. Extensive validation studies, including detection limit, precision, accuracy, recovery, shelf life, storage stability, comparison with commercial diffusive samplers, and the effects of shelter use were conducted in accordance with European Standards (EN). According to the validation results, all of the parameters evaluated for the diffusive sampler (for both long and short diffusion path designs) comply with the related standards and the sampler is expected to play an important role in the widespread monitoring of inorganic pollutants, since it is cheap, easy to use and deliverable within the country."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
