This comprehensive review meticulously examines the ecotoxicological impacts of three prevalent antibiotics-ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and sulfamethoxazole-on the ecosystems. Within this framework, our primary focus revolves around the key remediation technologies: adsorption and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In this context, an array of adsorbents is explored, spanning diverse classes such as biomass-derived biosorbents, graphene-based adsorbents, MXene-based adsorbents, silica gels, carbon nanotubes, carbon-based adsorbents, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), carbon nanofibers, biochar, metal oxides, and nanocomposites. On the flip side, the review meticulously examines the main AOPs widely employed in water treatment. This includes a thorough analysis of ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>), the photo-Fenton process, UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis, ozone/UV (O<sub>3</sub>/UV), radiation-induced AOPs, and sonolysis. Furthermore, the review provides in-depth insights into equilibrium isotherm and kinetic models as well as prospects and challenges inherent in these cutting-edge processes. By doing so, this review aims to empower readers with a profound understanding, enabling them to determine research gaps and pioneer innovative treatment methodologies for water contaminated with antibiotics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
