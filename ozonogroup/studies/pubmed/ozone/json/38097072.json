Three major pesticides (thiacloprid, chlortoluron, and pyrimethanil) were detected in rinse wastewater, with a total concentration of 38.47\u00a0mg C L<sup>-1</sup>. Comparing both technologies, ozonation in a stirred reactor achieved complete removal of these pesticides (720\u00a0min) while proving to be a more effective approach for reducing colour, organic matter, and bacteria. However, this technique produced transformation products and increased toxicity. In contrast, fungal bioremediation in a rotating drum bioreactor attenuated toxicity levels and did not produce such metabolites, but only removed approximately 50\u00a0% of target pesticide - hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5\u00a0days - and obtained worse results for most of the general quality parameters studied. This work also includes a preliminary economic assessment of both technologies, revealing that fungal bioremediation was 2 times more cost-effective than ozonation. The treatment train, consisting of a first stage of fungal bioremediation followed by ozonation, was found to be a promising approach as it synergistically combines the advantages of both treatments, achieving high removals of pesticides (up to 100\u00a0%) and transformation products, while reducing operating costs and producing a biodegradable effluent. This is the first time that fungal bioremediation and ozonation technologies have been compared and combined in a treatment train to deal with pesticides in agricultural rinse wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
