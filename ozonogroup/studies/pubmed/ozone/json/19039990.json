Here we described seven pediatric RLS patients. All of the parents of our patients had difficult times to make their children sleep due to irritability, restlessness, and demanding bedtime routines. All patients had asked their parents to rub their feet in bed, and it took more than half an hour to soothe them until they fell asleep. Their mothers had been exhausted from this night-time routine. However, they did not consider the routine abnormal, as it had been their habitual behavior since infancy. Some parents were too distressed or embarrassed to describe the symptoms of their child properly. Five patients had clear family history and none had obvious periodic leg movements during sleep. All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases. In the severest two cases, pramipexole, but not iron, was dramatically effective. Both patients started to show RLS symptoms in the early days of infancy, which may suggest more severe hereditary dopaminergic dysfunction. RLS does occur in childhood and pediatricians should bear it in mind as one of the differential diagnoses when seeing children who are irritated and/or having difficulty in initiating their sleep."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mental Health and Environmental Effects Research, the Molecular Research Center for Children's Mental Development."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohri", "ForeName": "Ikuko", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kato-Nishimura", "ForeName": "Kumi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kagitani-Shimono", "ForeName": "Kuriko", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tachibana", "ForeName": "Naoko", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Keiichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taniike", "ForeName": "Masako", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "No To Hattatsu", "NlmUniqueID": "0215224", "ISSNLinking": "0029-0831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83619PEU5T", "NameOfSubstance": "Pramipexole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-73-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferritins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnosis, Differential"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency"], "DescriptorName": "Ferritins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Irritable Mood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pramipexole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychology, Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Restless Legs Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19039990"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
