For the effective oxidation and mineralization of DEHP by ozone in the existing TiO<sub>2</sub> catalytic processes, the heterogeneous catalyst, vanadium oxide (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)-incorporated TiO<sub>2</sub> (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>), was synthesized. The generation of hydroxyl radicals was promoted by cyclic redox reactions of vanadium atoms in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> via the increase of surface oxygen vacancies by the replacement of V<sup>5+</sup> species in the lattice of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The catalytic ozonation in the presence of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibited the significantly higher degradation of DEHP with the pseudo-second-order kinetic constant of 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>\u00a0mM<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup> and the removal efficiency of 58.7% after 60\u00a0s in 2\u00a0mg/L of ozone. The degradation of DEHP was initiated by the shortening of the alkyl-side chain followed by the opening of esterified benzene moieties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
