Here, a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane was used to achieve ozone micro-bubble (0-80\u00a0\u00b5m) aeration in a simple way at gaseous pressures of 0.14-0.19\u00a0MPa. Compared with milli-bubble aeration, micro-bubble aeration increased the equilibrium aquatic O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by 1.53-3.25 times and apparent O<sub>3</sub> transfer rates by 3.12-3.35 times at pH 5.0-8.0. Consequently, the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH yield was 2.67-3.54 times via faster O<sub>3</sub> transfer to the aquatic solution followed by decomposition rather than interfacial reaction. Ozone micro-bubble aeration outperformed milli-bubble aeration, with the degradation kinetics of 2,4-D being 3.08-4.36 times higher. Both O<sub>3</sub>-oxidation and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH oxidation were important to the promotion with the contributions being 35.8%-45.9% and 54.1%-64.2%, respectively. The operational and water matric conditions influenced the oxidation performance via both O<sub>3</sub> oxidation and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH oxidation, which is reported for the first time. In general, the ceramic membrane offered a low-energy approach of ozone micro-bubble aeration for efficient pollutant degradation. The O<sub>3</sub> oxidation and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH oxidation were proportionally promoted by ozone micro-bubble due to O<sub>3</sub> transfer enhancement. Thus, the promotive mechanism can be interpreted as the synchronous enchantment on ozone exposure and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH exposure for the first time."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
