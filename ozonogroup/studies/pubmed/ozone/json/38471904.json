Identifying the sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> to the precursors volatile organic compounds \uff08VOCs\uff09 and nitrogen oxides \uff08NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>\uff09 can help make effective abatement strategies. This study compared three methods for determining O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> sensitivity\uff1a simulated photochemical indicator values and sensitivity coefficients derived from a three-dimensional air quality model and an observation-based model \uff08OBM\uff09\uff0c with a case study involving an O<sub>3</sub> pollution event that occurred in Nanjing in late July 2017. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity based on the photochemical indicator and sensitivity coefficients demonstrated similar spatial variations \uff08over 50% of the grid cells of Nanjing exhibiting identical O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity\uff09. However\uff0c sensitivity coefficients identified a larger number of areas within a transitional O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity regime\uff0c as opposed to the VOCs- or NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>-limited regime identified by the photochemical indicator. The determination of the latter was affected by the adopted threshold values. The OBM relied on the quality of the observational data. For example\uff0c positive biases in observed NO<sub>2</sub> could lead to an underestimation of O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity to NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> with the OBM. During the high pollution period\uff0c the three methods exhibited significant disparities. The photochemical indicator tended to suggest the VOCs-limited condition\uff0c whereas the OBM and sensitivity coefficients indicated the NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>-limited or transitional regimes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Gan-Yu", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Mo-Mei", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Ming-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing-Yi", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471904", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202301164"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
