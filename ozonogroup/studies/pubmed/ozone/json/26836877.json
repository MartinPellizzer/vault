The optical properties of reflection filters were characterized by a high-precision vacuum ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The vulnerability of the filter's microstructures to environmental contamination and the recovery of the optical properties of the stored filter samples with ultraviolet ozone cleaning were experimentally demonstrated. For reflection filters with the optimized nonquarter-wave multilayer structures, the reflectance ratios R135.6\u2009nm/R130.4\u2009nm of 92.7 and 20.6 were achieved for 7\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 angles of incidence, respectively. On the contrary, R135.6\u2009nm/R130.4\u2009nm ratio of 12.4 was obtained for a reflection filter with a standard \u03c0-stack multilayer structure with H/L=1/4 at 7\u00b0 AOI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Mingdong", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Dawei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bincheng", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26836877", "10.1364/AO.54.010498", "333287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
