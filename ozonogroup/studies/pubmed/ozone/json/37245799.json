The results suggested that introducing net-zero carbon technology would contribute to a 50-60\u00a0% decrease in primary NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO emissions and a ~30\u00a0% decrease in primary emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The estimated emission inventory and future meteorological conditions in 2050 were applied as inputs to a chemical transport model. A scenario involving the application of future reduction strategies with relatively moderate global warming (RCP4.5) was evaluated. The results showed that the concentration of tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was highly reduced compared with that in 2015 after applying net-zero carbon reduction strategies. On the other hand, the fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentration under the 2050 scenario was expected to be equal or higher because of the growth in secondary aerosol formation caused by the increase in short-wave radiation. Finally, the premature mortality change from 2015 to 2050 was analyzed, and the change in air quality contributed by net-zero carbon technology will contribute to a ~4000 decrease in premature deaths in Japan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
