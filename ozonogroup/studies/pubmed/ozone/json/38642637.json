Incident cases of AOA were identified using health administrative data of the National Health Services. O<sub>3</sub> exposure at participants' residential addresses was estimated by a spatio-temporal model. Instrumental variable (IV) modelling was used to analyze the causal association between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and AOA, by incorporating wind speed and planetary boundary layer height as IVs into time-dependent Cox model. Negative control outcome (accidental injury) was also used to additionally evaluate unmeasured confounding.", "During a mean follow-up of 11.38 years, a total of 10,973 incident AOA cases were identified. A U-shaped concentration-response relationship was observed between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and AOA in the traditional Cox models with HR of 0.916 (95% CI: 0.888, 0.945) for O<sub>3</sub> at low levels (<38.17\u00a0ppb), and 1.204 (95% CI: 1.168, 1.242) for O<sub>3</sub> at high levels (\u226538.17\u00a0ppb). However, in the IV analysis we only found a statistically significant association between high-level O<sub>3</sub> exposure and AOA risk, but not for low-level O<sub>3</sub> exposure. No significant associations between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and accidental injury were observed.", "Our findings suggest a potential causal relationship between long-term exposure to high-level ambient O<sub>3</sub> and increased risks of AOA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
