Synthetic saline water with Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA) showed comparable results to natural brackish and sea water for Br-THMs formation during chlorination and ozonation for typical ballast water treatment conditions ([Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sub>0</sub>\u202f\u2265\u202f5\u202fmg/L or [O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>0</sub>\u202f\u2265\u202f3\u202fmg/L). The molar CHBr<sub>3</sub> yield in synthetic saline waters is higher for chlorination than for ozonation, since ozone reacts slower with bromide and faster with THM precursors. For bromination, the molar yields of CHBr<sub>3</sub> for the NOM model compounds phenol, resorcinol, 3-oxopentanedioic acid and hydroquinone are 28, 62, 91 and 11%, respectively. CHBr<sub>3</sub> formation is low during chlorination or ozonation of resorcinol-containing synthetic saline waters due to the faster reaction of resorcinol with these oxidants compared to the bromine formation from bromide. Oxidation experiments with mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol (or resorcinol) were conducted to mimic various functional groups of NOM reacting with Cl<sub>2</sub> (or O<sub>3</sub>) in saline water. With increasing hydroquinone concentrations, the CHBr<sub>3</sub> formation increases during both chlorination and ozonation of the mixtures, except for chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol. The formation of THMs during chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to that of resorcinol alone due to the much faster reaction of HOX with resorcinol compared to hydroquinone. In general, PLFA seems to be a reasonable DOM surrogate to simulate CHBr<sub>3</sub> formation for realistic ballast water treatment. During chlorination, CHBr<sub>3</sub> formations from phenol- and PLFA-containing synthetic brackish waters are comparable, for similar phenol contents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
