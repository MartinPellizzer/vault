We have previously shown that several proteins in atmospheric PM are allergenic in mouse asthma models and that these proteins are nitrated by atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in chemical reactions. Based on these results, the amount of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in atmospheric PM could be an air pollution marker integrating NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM. We established a method to measure 3-NT by high-performance liquid chromatography electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Although this method is accurate, it requires a filter treatment process, which is time-consuming and costly for an environmental monitoring tool, in which many samples are measured simultaneously. Therefore, in this study, we investigated a simple immunoblotting method in which atmospheric PM proteins were directly transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and measured using an anti-3-NT antibody (the filter blot method). The 3-NT value obtained from this method was significantly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.809, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with that of the HPLC-ECD method, with a detection power of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for tyrosine nitrated bovine serum albumin equivalents. Multiple regression analysis using the filter blot method showed that the amount of 3-NT in atmospheric PM was significantly associated with the published environmental measurements of O<sub>3</sub> and PM in the region. Therefore, the filter blot method may be useful for the environmental monitoring of 3-NT in atmospheric PM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
