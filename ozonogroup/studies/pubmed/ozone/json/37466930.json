Environmental risk factors can exacerbate these risks or independently contribute to CVD. Ozone is an overlooked and invisible risk factor, and it plays a significant role in the development of CVD. Our study provides a novel quantification of the ozone-attributable CVD mortality burden based on daily maximum 8-h average ozone concentration during May to October (6mDMA8) in Chinese adults in 2050, projected under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 585 and 126, and using the updated WHO air quality guideline level. The study also considers the contributions made by changes in ozone exposure, population aging, population size, and baseline death rates of CVD between 2019 and 2050. While adopting a sustainable and green pathway (SSP 126) can reduce the projected magnitude of premature CVD deaths to 359,200 in 2050, it may not be sufficient to reduce the CVD mortality burden significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to implement strategies for stricter ozone control and reducing the baseline death rate of CVD to mitigate the impacts of ozone on Chinese adults."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building Science, School of Architecture, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Mingyao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and National Health Commission Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, ETH Zurich, Zurich 8092, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shuchang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building Science, School of Architecture, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yumeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1871-8999"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and National Health Commission Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital of Fudan University, National Center for Children's Health, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "LastName": "Kan", "ForeName": "Haidong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9727-1963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuxiao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5002-118X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "John S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1325-6091"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building Science, School of Architecture, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37466930", "10.1021/acs.est.3c02076"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
