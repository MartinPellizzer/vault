However, the effect of houseplant-emitted isoprene on the association between ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation and respiratory health remains unclear. We recruited 60 adult subjects from 60 houses with or without houseplants (1:1) in Taipei; twelve house visits were conducted in each home throughout 2014. The indoor air pollutants that were measured consisted of particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5\u202f\u03bcm in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), O<sub>3</sub> and isoprene. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured in each study subject during each house visit. Household information was collected by a questionnaire. Mixed-effects models were used to explore the association between indoor air pollution levels and PEFR. We found that the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and isoprene in houses with houseplants were higher than those in houses without houseplants. In contrast, PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels and % predicted PEFR were higher in houses without houseplants than in those with houseplants. Moreover, increased levels of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in houses with houseplants were associated with a decreased % predicted PEFR, especially in the summer. We concluded that increased levels of indoor O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were associated with decreased PEFR. The presence of houseplants was associated with indoor O<sub>3</sub>, isoprene and PEFR variations in the summer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
