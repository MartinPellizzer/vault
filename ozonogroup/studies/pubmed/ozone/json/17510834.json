This report describes a new exposure system that can be used to expose animals to both directly emitted particles and to secondary particles. The system consists of three main components. The first is a sampling system to continuously collect and dilute power plant stack emissions. The second is a reaction laboratory that contains reaction chambers to simulate atmospheric reactions. The following atmospheric reactions were simulated: (1) the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to form sulfuric acid, (2) the neutralization of sulfuric acid by ammonia, and (3) the reaction of alpha-pinene with ozone to form secondary organic aerosol. Using these chambers with the diluted emissions, different typical atmospheric scenarios can be simulated. The final component is a mobile toxicology laboratory where animals are exposed to the resulting test aerosols. We report here the characteristics of the test aerosol exposures obtained at a coal-fired electric power plant. Particle exposures were characterized for concentrations of mass, elements, elemental carbon, organic species, inorganic ions, strong acidity, particle number, and size distributions. Mass concentrations ranged from a few micrograms per cubic meter for a scenario of primary emissions only, to about 250 microg m(-3) for the most complex scenario. We show that the different scenarios produced a large variation in the composition of the test aerosol, thus potentially changing the toxicity of the emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure, Epidemiology, and Risk Program, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA. pruiz@hsph.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruiz", "ForeName": "Pablo A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Tarun", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Choong-Min", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawrence", "ForeName": "Joy E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferguson", "ForeName": "Stephen T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolfson", "ForeName": "Jack M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rohr", "ForeName": "Annette C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "Petros", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17510834", "10.1080/08958370701353148", "778849303"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
