Kudoa neurophila n. comb. (Grossel, Dykov\u00e1, Handlinger & Munday) has historically infected hatchery-produced striped trumpeter, Latris lineata (Forster in Bloch and Schneider), a candidate species for seacage aquaculture in Australia. We examined the efficacy of four water treatment methods to prevent K. neurophila infection in post-larval (paperfish) and juvenile striped trumpeter. Treatments included dose-controlled ultraviolet irradiation [hydro-optic disinfection (HOD)], ozone with conventional UV (ozone), mechanical filtration at 25 \u03bcm and then foam fractionation (primary filtration), and 50-\u03bcm-filtered sea water (control). In post-larvae (initially 10.3 \u00b1 2.7 g, mean \u00b1 SD, 259 days post-hatching, dph), the infection prevalence (PCR test) after 51 days was 93 \u00b1 12% in the control, 100 \u00b1 0% in primary filtration and 0 \u00b1 0% in both ozone and HOD. Likewise, in juveniles (initially 114 \u00b1 18 g, 428 dph), prevalence was 100 \u00b1 0% in the control and primary filtration treatments with no infection detected in ozone and HOD. Concurrently, there was a 50-100% reduction in heterotrophic bacteria and 100% reduction in presumptive Vibrio sp. in sea water HOD and ozone treatments. HOD with a dose of \u226544 mJ cm(-2) UV was as effective as ozonation at >700 mV ORP for 10 min, in preventing K. neurophila infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fisheries Aquaculture and Coasts Centre, Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. jenny.cobcroft@utas.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cobcroft", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Battaglene", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Fish Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9881188", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7775"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Load"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Fish Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myxozoa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Parasitic Diseases, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Perciformes"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vibrio"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22947107", "10.1111/j.1365-2761.2012.01413.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
