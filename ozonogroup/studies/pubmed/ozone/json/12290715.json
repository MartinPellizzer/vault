The manufacturer, London International in Florida, claims to have spent $16 million developing this condom. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that the condom is safe, it questioned test results showing that the polyurethane material did not biodegrade under relatively mild conditions. Therefore, the FDA required the company to perform additional animal toxicity studies, which showed that the product was safe for rabbits. This was necessary because certain polyurethanes when degrading in mild conditions release a known carcinogen and a potential toxin. Canadian officials are also reviewing Avanti for approval; Canada does not have standards for plastic condoms either. The co-inventor of the Avanti condom said in San Diego that the toxicity studies had been conducted to satisfy the FDA, and there were no indications that the polyurethane condom could cause cancer or other adverse reactions. However, one study was located in the literature linking asthma and contact dermatitis to substances released from polyurethane chemicals. Another issue was the silicone used as the lubricant for the condom. Long-term exposure to silicone is still debated, but moderate amounts are harmless, according a Canadian official. The manufacturers are also considering providing Avanti with the nonoxynol-9 spermicide, which would need FDA approval. The safety of the Avanti's retention ring was also questioned. It is a rubber-based elastomer used for nonallergenic gloves, safe for people with allergies. In addition, polyurethane is not susceptible to ozone and oxidation, and its shelf life is three years, although it remains stable up to five years, according to durability tests."]}], "OtherID": ["111703", "00252483"], "PMID": "12290715", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1996", "Month": "07", "Day": "02"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0274-726X", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "16", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "Feb"}}, "Title": "Contraceptive technology update", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contracept Technol Update"}, "ArticleTitle": "Avanti overcomes safety concerns raised by FDA.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "20", "EndPage": "22", "MedlinePgn": "20-2"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Contracept Technol Update", "NlmUniqueID": "8214749", "ISSNLinking": "0274-726X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Condoms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Government Agencies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organizations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Food and Drug Administration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Public Health Service"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12290715"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
