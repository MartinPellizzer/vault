Tracheal pressure, airflow, and tidal volume were measured in order to calculate lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Using the arterial/venous/double occlusion method, the total pressure gradient (deltaPT) was partitioned into four components (arterial, pre-, postcapillary and venous). Dose-response curves to acetylcholine (ACh), substance P (SP), and histamine were constructed in lungs isolated from rabbits immediately or 48 h after air or O3 exposure O3 induced a significant increase in the baseline value of deltaPt, more markedly 48 h after the exposure. Immediately after the exposure, O3 partly inhibited the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced decreases in Cdyn and increases in RL. This inhibitory effect was still in part present 48 h after O3 treatment. In the groups studied immediately after exposure, O3 did not significantly modify the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced vasoconstriction. Forty-eight hours after exposure, O3 induced a contractile response to ACh and SP in the arterial segment but decreased the response to histamine. We conclude that O3 can induce direct vascular constriction. Directly, but also 48 h after exposure, O3 can inhibit the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced changes in lung mechanical properties. Ozone can also induce some changes in the intensity and in the location of the vascular responses to ACh, SP, and histamine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology-Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delaunois", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Segura", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monta\u00f1o", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ansay", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gustin", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33507-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Substance P"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Compliance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance P"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9630453", "10.1006/taap.1998.8397", "S0041-008X(98)98397-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
