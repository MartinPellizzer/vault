However, the extent of air quality improvement depends on many factors including future levels of vehicle deployment, the evolution of emissions from other sources, and meteorology. An analysis of the impacts requires modeling the atmosphere to account for both primary and secondary air pollutants, and the use of health impact assessment tools to map air quality changes into quantifiable metrics of human health. Here, we quantify and compare the air quality and health impacts associated with the deployment of low-NO<sub>x</sub> CNG engines to power future MDV and HDV fleets in California relative to both a business-as-usual and a more advanced fleet composition. The results project that reductions in summer ground-level ozone could reach 13 ppb when compared to a baseline fleet of diesel and gasoline HDV and MDV and could reach 6 ppb when compared to a cleaner fleet that includes some zero-emission vehicles and fuels. Similarly, for all CNG cases considered reductions in PM<sub>2.5</sub> are predicted to range from 1.2 ug/m<sup>3</sup> to 2.7 ug/m<sup>3</sup> for a summer episode and from 3.1 ug/m<sup>3</sup> to approximately 7.8 ug/m<sup>3</sup> for a winter episode. These improvements yield short-term health benefits equivalent to $47 to $56 million in summer and $38 to $43 million in winter during episodes conducive to poor air quality. Additionally, the use of zero emission vehicle options such as battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks could achieve approximately 25% to 31% higher benefits for an equivalent fleet penetration level due to the additional emission reductions achieved.<i>Implications</i>: The paper provides a quantitative estimate of the air quality and human health benefits that can be achieved through the use of novel compressed natural gas engines (i.e., low-NO<sub>x</sub> CNG) in medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and provide a comparison with zero emission vehicles. Thus, our findings will provide support for policy development seeking to transform the trucking sector to meet clean air and climate goals given the current struggle policymakers have with selecting between alternative truck technologies due to variance in factors like cost and technical maturity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Power and Energy Program, University of California, Irvine, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Mac Kinnon", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Power and Energy Program, University of California, Irvine, California, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Computational Environmental Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Irvine, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Shupeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Power and Energy Program, University of California, Irvine, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Cervantes", "ForeName": "Alejandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Computational Environmental Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Irvine, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Dabdub", "ForeName": "Donald", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Power and Energy Program, University of California, Irvine, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Samuelsen", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Natural Gas"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Natural Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34287106", "10.1080/10962247.2021.1957727"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
