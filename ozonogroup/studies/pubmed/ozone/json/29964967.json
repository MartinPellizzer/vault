A cradle-to-grave LCA model was established to identify the key materials or processes that contribute most to environmental impacts within the life cycle of LABs, including material production, battery manufacture, transportation, use, and end-of-life. A large amount of primary data obtained from enterprisers and a Chinese LCA database were used in this research to reflect the status of technology and environmental management for the related industries in China. The results indicate that material production and LAB use dominate in resource consumption and environmental impacts during the life cycle of LABs. Material production is the most important driver of such impacts as abiotic resources depletion (699%), eutrophication (89%), photochemical smog production (98%), ozone depletion (117%), total human toxicity (159%), and ecological toxicity (484%). Battery use is responsible for 83% of primary energy use and contributes the highest potentials to the impacts related to energy, including global warming potential (86%) and acidification potential (70%). Recovery of materials at the end-of-life stage will significantly mitigate the overall life cycle impacts by reducing virgin material consumption. Based on the findings, there are several substantial opportunities to reduce the overall environmental impacts of batteries, such as prolonging the lifetime of batteries, reducing the metal consumption in batteries, and improving the technology and management in recovery of end-of-life batteries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Ji'nan 250100, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jin-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Water Science and Technology, Jiaxing 314006, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L\u00fc-Jun", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964967", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201612146"]}}]}
