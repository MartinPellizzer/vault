Controlling AFM<sub>1</sub> in milk is important to protect human health and trade. Preventing contamination by avoiding fungal contamination of cattle feed is the best method of control, however this is hard to avoid in some countries. Treating milk containing AFM<sub>1</sub> is an alternative control measure, however, there is no single approved method. The challenge is to select a treatment method that is effective but does not affect the organoleptic quality of milk. This study reviews the strategies for degrading AFM<sub>1</sub> in milk including yeast, lactic acid bacteria, enzyme, peroxide, ozone, UV light and cold plasma. This review compares the efficacy, influencing factors, (possible) mechanisms of activity, advantages, limitations and potential future trends of these methods and provides some recommendations for the treatment of milk to reduce the risk of AFM<sub>1</sub> contamination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
