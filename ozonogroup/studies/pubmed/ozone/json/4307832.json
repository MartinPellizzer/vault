Aldehydes, obtained from the long-chain bases by periodate oxidation, were converted to 1,3-dioxolane derivatives. Dioxolanes were identified and quantified by gas-liquid chromatography before and after catalytic hydrogenation, and before and after separation into saturated, monoene, and diene dioxolane fractions. The monoene dioxolanes were converted to aldehydes by reductive ozonolysis with dimethyl sulfide and these aldehydes were isolated and identified as dioxolane derivatives. The double bond positions in the major diene component were established by reductive ozonolysis and permanganate-periodate oxidation. Sphingenines in the cerebroside-sulfatide and sulfatide fractions of aorta were converted to aldehydes by the reductive ozonolysis of intact sphingolipids and these aldehydes were analyzed as the dioxolanes. Human aorta sphingomyelin contained significant amounts of 4-hexadecasphingenine, 4-heptadecasphingenine, sphinganine, 4-sphingenine, and 4,x14-sphingadienine. Small amounts of hexadecasphinganine, 4-tetradecasphingenine, a sphingadienine isomer, an unknown sphinganine, and two unknown diene long-chain bases were also found in sphingomyelin. The presence of a branched-chain 4-sphingenine was tentatively established and the possible presence of a sphingenine isomer was suggested. The major sphingenines were the same in the sphingomyelin, sulfatide, and cerebroside-sulfatide fractions of human aorta."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Panganamala", "ForeName": "R V", "Initials": "RV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geer", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cornwell", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Lipid Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0376606", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerebrosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10450-60-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Periodic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "95IT3W8JZE", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver Nitrate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebrosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dioxoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver Nitrate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1969", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1969", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1969", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4307832", "S0022-2275(20)43074-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
