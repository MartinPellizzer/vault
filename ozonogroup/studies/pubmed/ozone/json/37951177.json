Numerous studies have investigated microplastics pollution and their removal efficiency in drinking water treatment plants, none of which have involved nanoplastics due to lacking a suitable analytical method. This study introduced a feasible method of combing AFM-IR and Pyr-GC/MS to identify and quantify nanoplastics (20-1000\u00a0nm) for a preliminary understanding of their fate during drinking water treatment processes. Resolving of chemical functional groups and pyrolysis products from AFM-IR and Pyr-GC/MS data demonstrated the presence of PE and PVC nanoplastics in this drinking water treatment plant. The initial influent abundances of PE and PVC nanoplastics were 0.86\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 137.31\u00a0\u03bcg/L, with subsequent increase to 4.49\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 208.64\u00a0\u03bcg/L in ozonation contact tank unit. Then a gradual decreasing was observed along water process, achieving 98.4% removal of PE nanoplastics and 44.0% removal of PVC nanoplastics, respectively. Although this drinking water treatment plant has exhibited a certain level of nanoplastics removal efficiency, particular attention should be directed to the oxidation unit, which appears to be a significant source of nanoplastics. This study will lay a foundation for revealing nanoplastics pollution in the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
