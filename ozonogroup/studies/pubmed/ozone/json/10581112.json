Fifty-five adults, mean age 42 years, 53% men, and 39 children, mean age 11 years, 67% boys, wore two Ogawa passive samplers simultaneously: one for O(3), the other for NO(2) and NO. Mean outdoor pollution was measured at a regional monitoring network. Personal exposure levels were scattered; they were (on average) higher than stationary-site levels for NO and lower for NO(2) and O(3). In adults, 41% of the variance of personal exposure to NO(2) was explained by mean stationary-site measurement levels (P<0.0001). Twenty-one percent additional variance was explained by living near a main road, not having an extractor fan over the cooker, older age, and male sex. NO and O(3) personal exposures correlated poorly with stationary-site measurements. In panel studies of the health effects of air pollution, personal exposure to NO(2) and NO can be measured satisfactorily by passive samplers: such measurements are necessary for NO but not for NO(2). For O(3), accurate personal exposure measurement remains a challenge and further technical development is required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale U408, Paris, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liard", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zureik", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le Moullec", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soussan", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glorian", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grimfeld", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neukirch", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Activities of Daily Living"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10581112", "10.1006/enrs.1999.3993", "S0013-9351(99)93993-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
