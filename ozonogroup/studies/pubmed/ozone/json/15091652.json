Ambient air was passed through charcoal filters to produce a 0.5 times ambient ozone treatment, and ozone generated from oxygen was added to produce one and two times ambient ozone treatments. In Experiment 1, treatments were applied for 8-12 h each day for 112 days of the 1988 growing season; then the plants were grown outdoors with ambient ozone in 1989. In Experiment 2, treatments were applied for 9 h each day for 98 days of the 1989 growing season; then the plants were grown outdoors with ambient ozone in 1990. Shallow wounds were made into the bark tissue and inoculated with either an aqueous suspension of conidia of Mycosphaerella populorum or sterile water on 1 and 2 September 1988 (Experiment 1) or 16 and 17 August 1989 (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, wounds were inoculated either 0, 7, or 14 days after wounding. In Experiment 2, wounds were inoculated either 0, 3, or 6 days after wounding. Canker development was measured after harvest on 16 and 17 July 1989 (Experiment 1) and 28 May 1990 (Experiment 2). In both experiments, chronic exposure to ozone significantly increased the incidence of canker formation in inoculated wounds, and no cankers formed in wounds that received only sterile water. In Experiment 1, cankers formed only on plants inoculated the same day as wounding. No cankers formed on plants inoculated either 7 or 14 days after wounding. In Experiment 2, cankers formed on plants inoculated on the same day as wounding, and on a few plants inoculated 3 days after wounding. No cankers formed on plants inoculated 6 days after wounding. Additionally, in Experiment 2, exposure to increased concentrations of ozone caused a significantly higher number of plants to die during the subsequent winter. Analysis of partial correlation coefficients among plant growth and plant disease variables suggested that the observed ozone-induced increase in the susceptibility of the plants to disease was not mediated by alterations in plant growth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY 14853-1801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodbury", "ForeName": "P B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laurence", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hudler", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091652", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)90012-4", "0269749194900124"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
