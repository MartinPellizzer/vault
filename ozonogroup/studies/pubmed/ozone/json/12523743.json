The degradation rate of NP by UV/TiO2 was the highest among the tested NPEOs metabolites, while NP1EC showed the lowest degradation rate. In contrast, ozonation was especially effective for the breakdown of NP1EC. NP could be also degrade efficiently by ozonation, however, it was much less effective for NP1EO decomposition. Degradation of NP by both chemical oxidation processes followed first-order kinetics. The degradation curves of NP1EO and NP1EC could be approximately described by first-order kinetics also, although the degradation of NP1EC by ozonation seemed to follow a second-order kinetic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1, Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ike", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asano", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belkada", "ForeName": "F D", "Initials": "FD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsunoi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujita", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27986-36-3", "NameOfSubstance": "terics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79F6A2ILP5", "NameOfSubstance": "nonylphenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12523743"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
