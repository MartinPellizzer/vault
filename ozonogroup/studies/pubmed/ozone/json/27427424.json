Although spirometry was normal, she had decreased diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, bronchiolitis with air trapping on high-resolution CT scan and 60% lymphocytosis by bronchoalveolar lavage. Twenty-six antigens were tested and serum-specific precipitins were found mainly against Pseudomonas sp. and Mycobacterium mucogenicum. Cultures from her skincare device isolated Pseudomonas sp. Outcome was favorable with cessation of occupational exposure to the device, without any medication. This is the first report of a case of HP in a beautician due to steam contaminated by Pseudomonas sp. from a vapozone. HP, and not only asthma and contact dermatitis, should be suspected in beauticians with respiratory symptoms. Am. J. Ind.
