However, the contribution of MWTP discharge to bacterial hazards in the receiving rivers after upgrades has been largely unknown. In this study, high-throughput sequencing and shotgun metagenomics were applied to investigate the changes in the abundance, composition, potential risks, and contributions of bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from effluent to receiving river after upgrading the third-largest MWTP in China with denitrification biofilters, ultrafiltration, ozonation, and disinfection processes. The annual loadings of total nitrogen and 27 types of pharmaceuticals were reduced by 42.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.2% and 46.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.4%, respectively. Bacterial biomass decreased from (3.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49) to (1.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> 16S rRNA gene copies/mL, and identified biomarkers in effluent and downstream shifted due to the adopted processes. Opportunistic pathogen bacteria downstream were also reduced. Although the relative abundance of total ARGs in MWTP effluent increased from 1.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 to 2.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 copies/16S rRNA gene after upgrades, that of total and high-risk ARGs downstream showed no significant difference. More importantly, the Bayesian-based SourceTracker method provided valuable insight by revealing that the contributions of MWTP discharge to downstream bacteria (from 44.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5%-31.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9%) and ARGs (from 61.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3%-47.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1%) were significantly reduced following the upgrades, indicating upgrading MWTP showed integrated benefits to the bacterial hazards in the receiving river. This study provides useful information for better control of bacterial hazard risks and operational strategy for the improvement of the urban aquatic ecosystem."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
