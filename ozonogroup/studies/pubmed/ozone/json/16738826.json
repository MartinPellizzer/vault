The approach was implemented in the greater area of Thessaloniki and was part of a project aiming at the compliance with air quality standards in five major cities in Greece. The methodological approach comprises two stages: in the first stage, the availability of several measures contributing to a certain extent to reducing atmospheric pollution indicates a combinatorial problem and favors the use of Integer Programming. More specifically, Multiple Objective Integer Programming is used in order to generate alternative efficient combinations of the available policy measures on the basis of two conflicting objectives: public expenditure minimization and social acceptance maximization. In the second stage, these combinations of control measures (i.e., the control strategies) are then comparatively evaluated with respect to a wider set of criteria, using tools from Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis, namely, the well-known PROMETHEE method. The whole procedure is based on the active involvement of local and central authorities in order to incorporate their concerns and preferences, as well as to secure the adoption and implementation of the resulting solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Industrial and Energy Economics, Schools of Chemical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, 15780, Greece. mavrotas@chemeng.ntua.gr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mavrotas", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ziomas", "ForeName": "Ioannis C", "Initials": "IC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diakouaki", "ForeName": "Danae", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Manage", "NlmUniqueID": "7703893", "ISSNLinking": "0364-152X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "legislation & jurisprudence", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decision Making"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Manage. 1997 Jan;21(1):79-87", "ArticleIdList": ["8939787"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Int. 2003 Jun;29(2-3):289-302", "ArticleIdList": ["12676216"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Manage. 1999 Apr;23(3):279-295", "ArticleIdList": ["9950692"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2002 Jun;65(2):109-20", "ArticleIdList": ["12197074"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Manage. 2000 Dec;26(6):595-605", "ArticleIdList": ["11029111"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16738826", "10.1007/s00267-005-0111-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
