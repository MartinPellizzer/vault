Herein, the effects of ozone exposure on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) in lead-free tin halide PSCs as a facile and low-cost process for improving device performance are analyzed. Two types of tin-based PSCs and one typical lead-based PSC were fabricated. The ozone exposure on PEDOT:PSS increases the short-circuit current density (<i>J</i><sub>SC</sub>) and the fill factor (FF) of PSCs in all cases with perovskite grain enlargement and hole-mobility enhancement of the devices, respectively. For open-circuit voltage (<i>V</i><sub>OC</sub>), the outcome depends on the band gap and the energy levels of the perovskite films. While ozone exposure treatment is favorable for PEA<sub>0.15</sub>FA<sub>0.85</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub>-based tin PSCs, <i>V</i><sub>OC</sub> decreases with ozone exposure in the case of Ge:EDA<sub>0.01</sub>FA<sub>0.98</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub>-based tin PSCs because of a misalignment of the energy levels. Regardless, the efficiency of PEA<sub>0.15</sub>FA<sub>0.85</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub>-based tin PSCs increases from 8.7 to 10.1% when measured inside a glovebox upon ozone exposure of PEDOT:PSS. The efficiency of Ge:EDA<sub>0.01</sub>FA<sub>0.98</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub>-based tin PSCs increases from 6.8 to 8.1%, and the devices retain an efficiency of 5.0% even after 50 days in air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT) and Department of Nano Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry Education, Graduate School of Chemical Materials, Crystal Bank Institute, Pusan National University, 63-2 Busandaehak-ro, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nano Fusion Technology, Pusan National University, 63-2 Busandaehak-ro, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Nam", "ForeName": "Jeong-Seok", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT) and Department of Nano Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nano Fusion Technology, Pusan National University, 63-2 Busandaehak-ro, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kyusun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT) and Department of Nano Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry Education, Graduate School of Chemical Materials, Crystal Bank Institute, Pusan National University, 63-2 Busandaehak-ro, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nano Fusion Technology, Pusan National University, 63-2 Busandaehak-ro, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jiye", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, and Institute of Chemical Processes, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dawoon", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6274-3369"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, and Institute of Chemical Processes, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "In", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3736-3721"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Integrative Engineering, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-Ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong Hwan", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4220-8374"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT) and Department of Nano Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry Education, Graduate School of Chemical Materials, Crystal Bank Institute, Pusan National University, 63-2 Busandaehak-ro, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nano Fusion Technology, Pusan National University, 63-2 Busandaehak-ro, Busan 46241, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Il", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34464075", "10.1021/acsami.1c13546"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
