Of the detected micropollutants, phthalates were found to be the major contaminants. In this study, the estrogenic activities of the detected phthalates and raw water samples contaminated with the pollutants were assessed by the E-screen assay using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Of the phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) showed relatively high cell proliferation. Using DEP as a phthalate probe, three candidate processes, ozone alone, UV alone, and the ozone/UV combined, were evaluated for their efficiency in removing DEP and reducing its estrogenic activity. The ozone/UV process was shown to have the highest efficiency for the elimination of DEP and its by-products, leading to the complete mineralization of DEP. This study also found that the ozone/UV process is the best candidate to reduce the estrogenicity induced by DEP and its by-products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, YIEST, Yonsei University at Wonju campus, 234 Maeji, Heungup, Wonju 220-710, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Byung Soo", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Yeon Jung", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Young Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Young Sook", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Joon-Wun", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UF064M00AF", "NameOfSubstance": "diethyl phthalate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16581108", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2006.02.051", "S0048-9697(06)00195-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
