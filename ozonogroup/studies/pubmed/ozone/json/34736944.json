To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper where the ozonation and photodegradation (VIS and UV photolysis, degradation in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV system, photosensitized oxidation) of 1OHIBF, 4EBA and MPPE are reported. The processes were performed in demineralized and natural river water. The influence of various reaction parameters on the removal degree was checked. Both, photolysis under VIS light and photosensitized oxidation of target compounds are very low-efficient processes. Ozonation and degradation in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV system are effective methods for ibuprofen derivatives degradation. Components present in river water reduced removal degree of investigated compounds during ozonation and degradation in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV system. The biodegradability assessment using the Average Oxidation State (AOS) and COD/TOC ratio proved the formation of more oxidized by-products during both processes. The determined second-order rate constants for ozone reaction with 1OHIBF, 4EBA and MPPE are 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, 10.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.36 and 3.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The calculated reaction rate constants of hydroxyl radicals with MPPE, 4EBA and 1OHIBF are 3.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>, 6.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup> and 1.06\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
