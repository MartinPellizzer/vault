Climate change has many, mostly adverse, effects on the human health. Environmental anthropogenic changes represent significant health risks including factors that may increase probability and seriousness of skin cancer diseases. There are many scientific studies on skin cancer but only a few of them are focused on environment changes and their influence on the behaviour of humans, which may lead to skin cancer. The goal of the research was to analyse environment changes in the city of Brno (Czech Republic) and their influence on the behaviour of people and some skin diseases. A research hypothesis was set up that total increase in the incidence of skin diseases would be monitored. 1757 patients aged 25-65\u202fyears participated in the research. The analysis was performed based on measured (mean annual temperatures, average monthly temperatures, ultraviolet index values, and numbers of sunny days and sunny hours) data in 2011-2019. In order to monitor the trend, temperature data from 1961 to 2019 were evaluated too. The analysed data indicate that the trend of average monthly and annual temperatures observed was increasing in recent years. Moreover, based on data obtained from the analysed doctor's office it was found out that the incidence of skin diseases increased in the studied period. The main reasons to increase include excessive exposure to sun, extended average age of the population, ozone layer depletion, climatic and weather changes, increased migration and behaviour of people."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
