Cr(VI) is formed when welding with chromium-containing alloys and is a suspected carcinogen. Ozone is formed by the action of ultraviolet light from the arc on oxygen and can cause severe irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. Previous work has demonstrated that reduction of sodium and potassium in manual metal arc-welding electrodes leads to substantial reductions in Cr(VI) concentrations in the fume as well as a reduction in the fume formation rate. In this paper replacement of potassium by lithium in a tubular wire welding electrode (self-shielding flux-cored) is shown to give reductions in Cr(VI) concentrations and fume formation rates. Previous work has also demonstrated that use of a tubular wire (metal cored) containing 1% zinc can, under certain conditions, result in a reduction in Cr(VI) formation rate and in ozone concentration near the arc but with a rise in the total fume formation rate. The effects of different shield gases and different levels of zinc are examined. An experimental chromium-containing tubular wire with 1% zinc was used with the following shield gases: argon, Argoshield 5, Argoshield 20, Helishield 101, Ar + 2% CO2, Ar + 5% CO2, Ar + 1% O2 and Ar + 2% O2. The wire gave > 98% reduction in Cr(VI) formation rate compared to the control wire provided the shield gas contained no oxygen. When the shield gas did contain oxygen, 1% zinc enhanced Cr(VI) formation rate, resulting in more than double the rates measured when welding with the control wire. Experiments with zinc concentrations, from 0.018 to 0.9% using Helishield 101, gave results indicating that there is an optimum zinc concentration from the point of view of Cr(VI) reduction. Implications of the use of lithium or zinc on the overall exposure risk are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, University of Bradford, UK. j.h.dennis@bradford.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dennis", "ForeName": "John H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "French", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hewitt", "ForeName": "Peter J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortazavi", "ForeName": "Seyed B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Redding", "ForeName": "Christopher A J", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Occup Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "0203526", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4878"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9FN79X2M3F", "NameOfSubstance": "Lithium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lithium"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12005130", "10.1093/annhyg/mef024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
