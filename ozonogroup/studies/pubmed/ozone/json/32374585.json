Similarly, with the emergence of green hydrogen economy, lightweight barrier materials for storage and transport of this highly diffusive gas are very much sought-after, particularly in aviation technology. Here the fabrication of ultraperformance nanocomposite barrier liners by spray coating lamellar liquid crystalline dispersions of high aspect ratio (\u223c20\u202f000) silicate nanosheets mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol) on a PET substrate foil is presented. Lightweight nanocomposite liners with 50 wt % filler content are obtained showing helium and hydrogen permeabilities as low as 0.8 and 0.6 cm<sup>3</sup> \u03bcm m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> atm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. This exhibits an improvement up to a factor of 4 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> as compared to high-barrier polymers such as ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers. Furthermore, ozone resistance, illustrated by oxygen permeability measurements at elevated relative humidity (75% r.h.), and water vapor resistance are demonstrated. Moreover, the technically benign processing by spray coating will render this barrier technology easily transferable to real lighter-than-air technologies or irregular- and concave-shaped hydrogen tanks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bavarian Polymer Institute and Department of Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Habel", "ForeName": "Christoph", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bavarian Polymer Institute and Department of Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Tsurko", "ForeName": "Evgeny S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bavarian Polymer Institute and Department of Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Timmins", "ForeName": "Renee L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Polymer Engineering, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hutschreuther", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bavarian Polymer Institute and Department of Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kunz", "ForeName": "Raphael", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bavarian Polymer Institute and Department of Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schuchardt", "ForeName": "Dominik D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bavarian Polymer Institute and Department of Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Rosenfeldt", "ForeName": "Sabine", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Polymer Engineering, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Altst\u00e4dt", "ForeName": "Volker", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2547-3950"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bavarian Polymer Institute and Department of Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 30, Bayreuth, 95447, Germany."}], "LastName": "Breu", "ForeName": "Josef", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32374585", "10.1021/acsnano.0c01633"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
