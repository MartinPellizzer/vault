This study aimed to assess the long-term effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on all-cause mortality among Chinese adults, as well as to examine potential regional heterogeneity across the globe.", "A national dynamic cohort of 42153 adults aged 16+\u00a0years were recruited from 25 provinces across Chinese mainland and followed up during 2010-2018. Annual warm-season (April-September) O<sub>3</sub> and year-round co-pollutants (i.e., nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>]\u00a0and fine particulate matter [PM<sub>2.5</sub>]) were simulated through validated spatial-temporal prediction models and were assigned to each enrollee in each calendar year. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposures were employed to assess the O<sub>3</sub>-mortality association. Concentration-response (C-R) curves were fitted by natural cubic spline function to investigate the potential nonlinear association. Both single-pollutant model and co-pollutant models additionally adjusting for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and/or NO<sub>2</sub> were employed to examine the robustness of the estimated association. The random-effect meta-analysis was adopted to pool effect estimates from the current and prior population-based cohorts (n\u00a0=\u00a029), and pooled C-R curves were fitted through the meta-smoothing approach by regions.", "The study population comprised of 42153 participants who contributed 258921.5 person-years at risk (median 6.4 years), of whom 2382 death events occurred during study period. Participants were exposed to an annual average of 51.4 ppb (range: 22.7-74.4 ppb) of warm-season O<sub>3</sub> concentration. In the single-pollutant model, a significantly increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.098 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.023-1.179) was associated with a 10-ppb rise in O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Associations remained robust to additional adjustments of co-pollutants, with HRs of 1.099 (95% CI: 1.023-1.180) in bi-pollutant model (+PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and 1.093 (95% CI: 1.018-1.174) in tri-pollutant model (+PM<sub>2.5</sub>+NO<sub>2</sub>), respectively. A J-shaped C-R relationship was identified among Chinese general population, suggesting significant excess mortality risk at high ozone exposure only. The combined C-R curves from Asia (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and North America (n\u00a0=\u00a017) demonstrated an overall increased risk of all-cause mortality with O<sub>3</sub> exposure, with pooled HRs of 1.124 (95% CI: 0.966-1.307) and 1.023 (95% CI: 1.007-1.039) per 10-ppb rise, respectively. Conversely, an opposite association was observed in Europe (n\u00a0=\u00a08, HR: 0.914 [95% CI: 0.860-0.972]), suggesting significant heterogeneity across regions (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).", "This study provided national evidence that high O<sub>3</sub> exposure may curtail long-term survival of Chinese general population. Great between-region heterogeneity of pooled O<sub>3</sub>-mortality was identified across North America, Europe, and Asia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
