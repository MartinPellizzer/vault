Ozone at a concentration of over 100 ppm with high humidity was highly virucidal against 4 RNA viruses: HVJ, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), Reo type 3 virus (RV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV). For the ozone tests, 0.1 ml of a virus suspension in deionized water or saline and was placed in 35-mm dishes. The titer of 10(6) plaque-forming units of TMEV in a liquid-phase, which was highly stable against physical treatments, was reduced within 1 hr to a level of 0 by 300 ppm of ozone at 80% humidity and 22-25 degrees C. HVJ and MHV were more susceptible than TMEV to the ozone treatment. RV was the most resistant of the 4 viruses. The ozonization method may be a good way to disinfect not only for the laboratory animal RNA-viruses (both of enveloped and unenveloped viruses) but also animal rooms, clean rooms and even safety cabinets."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory Animal Center for Biomedical Research, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wananabe", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyata", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jikken Dobutsu", "NlmUniqueID": "1256412", "ISSNLinking": "0007-5124"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Laboratory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mammalian orthoreovirus 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maus Elberfeld virus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Murine hepatitis virus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "RNA Viruses"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2163330", "10.1538/expanim1978.39.2_223"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
