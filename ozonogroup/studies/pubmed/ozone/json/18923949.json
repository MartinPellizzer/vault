Data on all eligible bladder cancer deaths were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. The control group consisted of people who died from causes other than cancer or diseases associated with genitourinary problems. The controls were pair matched to the cases by sex, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each case. Classification of exposure to municipality air pollution was based on the measured levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. The results of the present study show that there is a significant positive association between the levels of air pollution and bladder cancer mortality. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.37 (1.03-1.82) for the group with medium air pollution level and 1.98 (1.36-2.88) for the group with high air pollution level when compared to the group with the low air pollution level. Trend analyses showed statistically significant trend in risk of death from bladder cancer with increasing air pollution level. The findings of this study warrant further investigation of the role of air pollutants in the etiology of bladder cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, 100 Shih-Chuan 1st Road, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chia-Chia", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Shang-Shyue", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Hui-Fen", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Trong-Neng", "Initials": "TN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chih-Cheng", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Causality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Marital Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health Administration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urbanization"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18923949", "10.1080/08958370802207326", "904171300"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
