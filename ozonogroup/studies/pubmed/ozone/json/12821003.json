Conventional parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), pH, conductivity, colour removal, biodegradability (BOD(5/28)), and toxic potential of the dye and its degradation products were monitored during the process. The results obtained indicated that ozonation is a highly effective way to remove the colour of a corresponding dye solution. However, a considerable organic load still remained as indicated by high COD and TOC residues. The COD, TOC reductions were about 40% and 25% for 6 h ozonation of 2 gl(-1) RB5 aqueous solution. During the ozonation process the rapid decrease of pH and the sharp increase of conductivity indicated the formation of acidic by-products and small fragments and ions which were identified by high performance ion chromatography. The BOD28 data revealed that first by-products after partial ozonation (10-150 min) of RB5 were more biodegradable than the parent compound and ozonation can enhance the biodegradability of azo dyes. During the first 150 min of total 360 min of oxidation, the formation of first by-products with high toxic potential took place as it could be confirmed by two acute toxicity-screening tests, the bioluminescence test (Vibrio fischerii) and the neutral red cytotoxicity assay (rat hepatoma cells). The significant enhancement of microbial biodegradability after long-term ozonation could also be seen as a decrease of toxic intermediates in correlation with the ozonation time as indicated in BOD28 biological degradation test results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunxia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yediler", "ForeName": "Ayfer", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lienert", "ForeName": "Doris", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zijian", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kettrup", "ForeName": "Antonius", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O0HDY58362", "NameOfSubstance": "Remazol black B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vibrio"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12821003", "10.1016/S0045-6535(03)00331-X", "S0045-6535(03)00331-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
