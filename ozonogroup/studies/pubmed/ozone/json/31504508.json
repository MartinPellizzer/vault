Findings from the few studies using data from IVF populations to investigate associations between specific pollutants and treatment outcomes are inconclusive.", "Retrospective cohort study of 253\u2009528 non-cancelled fresh, autologous IVF cycles including 230\u2009243 fresh, autologous IVF cycles with a transfer of \u22651 embryo was performed between 2010 and 2012.", "We linked 2010-2012 National ART Surveillance System data for fresh, autologous IVF cycles with the ambient air pollution data generated using a Bayesian fusion model available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. We calculated county-level average daily PM2.5 and O3 concentrations for three time periods: cycle start to oocyte retrieval (T1), oocyte retrieval to embryo transfer (T2) and embryo transfer +14\u00a0days (T3). Multivariable predicted marginal proportions from logistic and log-linear regression models were used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CI for the association between reproductive outcomes (implantation rate, pregnancy and live birth) and interquartile increases in PM2.5 and O3. The multipollutant models were also adjusted for patients and treatment characteristics and accounted for clustering by clinic and county of residence.", "For all exposure periods, O3 was weakly positively associated with implantation (aRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.02 for T1; aRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.02 for T2 and aRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.02 for T3) and live birth (aRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.002-1.02 for T1; aRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.004-1.02 for T2 and aRR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004-1.03 for T3). PM2.5 was not associated with any of the reproductive outcomes assessed.", "The main limitation of this study is the use of aggregated air pollution data as proxies for individual exposure. The weak positive associations found in this study might be related to confounding by factors that we were unable to assess and may not reflect clinically meaningful differences.", "More research is needed to assess the impact of air pollution on reproductive function.", "None."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
