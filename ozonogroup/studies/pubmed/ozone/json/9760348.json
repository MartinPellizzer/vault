The present study was aimed at determining the effect of O3 on the responses of pulmonary C fibers to chemical and mechanical stimuli. A total of 31 C fibers were studied in anesthetized, open-chest, and vagotomized rats. During control, right atrial injection of a low dose of capsaicin abruptly evoked a short and mild burst of discharge [0.77 +/- 0.28 impulses (imp)/s, 2-s average]. After acute exposure to O3 (3 parts/million for 30 min), there was no significant change in arterial blood pressure, tracheal pressure, or baseline activity of C fibers. However, the stimulatory effect of the same dose of capsaicin on these fibers was markedly enhanced (6.05 +/- 0.88 impulses/s; P < 0.01) and prolonged immediately after O3 exposure, and returned toward control in 54 +/- 6 min. Similarly, the pulmonary C-fiber response to injection of a low dose of lactic acid was also elevated after O3 exposure. Furthermore, O3 exposure significantly potentiated the C-fiber response to constant-pressure (tracheal pressure = 30 cmH2O) lung inflation (control: 0.19 +/- 0.07 imp/s; after O3: 1.12 +/- 0.26 imp/s; P < 0.01). In summary, these results show that the excitabilities of pulmonary C-fiber afferents to lung inflation and injections of chemical stimulants are markedly potentiated after acute exposure to O3, suggesting a possible involvement of these afferents in the O3-induced changes in breathing pattern and chest discomfort in humans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-40369", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Afferent Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Evoked Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "innervation", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Fibers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neural Conduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vagotomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vagus Nerve"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9760348", "10.1152/jappl.1998.85.4.1509"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
