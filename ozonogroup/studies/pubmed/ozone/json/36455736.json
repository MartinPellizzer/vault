Here, an environmentally friendly, simple, and green biochar catalyst rich in nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) has been prepared by the pyrolysis of kelp. Compared with directly carbonized kelp biomass (KB), acid-activated KB (KBA) and base-activated KB (KBB) have higher specific surface areas and more extensive porous structures, although only KBB displays effective ozone activation. Imazapic (IMZC), a refractory organic herbicide, was chosen as the target pollutant, which has apparently not hitherto been investigated in the HCO process. Second-order rate constants (k) for the reactions of IMZC with three different reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically k<sub>O3, IMZC</sub>, k<sub>OH, IMZC</sub>, and k<sub>1O2, IMZC</sub>, have been determined as 0.974, 2.48 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>, and 6.23 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The amounts of graphitic N and thiophene S derived from the intrinsic N and S showed good correlations with the IMZC degradation rate, implicating them as the main active sites. OH and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> were identified as main ROS in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation system for IMZC degradation. This study exemplified the utilization of endogenous N and S in biological carbon, and provided more options for the application of advanced oxidation processes and the development of marine resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
