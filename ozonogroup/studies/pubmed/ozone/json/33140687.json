Neighborhood community-based interventions have been shown to be both effective and cost-effective in preventing cardiovascular disease. There is a dearth of robust studies identifying the key determinants of cardiovascular disease and the underlying effect mechanisms at the neighborhood level. We aim to contribute to the evidence base for neighborhood cardiovascular health research. Methods and Results We created a new neighborhood health data set at the census tract level by integrating 4 types of potential predictors, including unhealthy behaviors, prevention measures, sociodemographic factors, and environmental measures from multiple data sources. We used 4 tree-based machine learning techniques to identify the most critical neighborhood-level factors in predicting the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke, and compared their predictive performance for variable selection. We further quantified the effects of the identified determinants on stroke prevalence using a Bayesian linear regression model. Of the 5 most important predictors identified by our method, higher prevalence of low physical activity, larger share of older adults, higher percentage of non-Hispanic Black people, and higher ozone levels were associated with higher prevalence of stroke at the neighborhood level. Higher median household income was linked to lower prevalence. The most important interaction term showed an exacerbated adverse effect of aging and low physical activity on the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke. Conclusions Tree-based machine learning provides insights into underlying drivers of neighborhood cardiovascular health by discovering the most important determinants from a wide range of factors in an agnostic, data-driven, and reproducible way. The identified major determinants and the interactive mechanism can be used to prioritize and allocate resources to optimize community-level interventions for stroke prevention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Science and Policy Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Health Care Delivery Science Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Liangyuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Science and Policy Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bian", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Science and Policy Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Health Care Delivery Science Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Jiayi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Science and Policy Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York NY."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 HL141427", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R21 CA235153", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 MD013886", "Acronym": "MD", "Agency": "NIMHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R21 CA245855", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Am Heart Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "101580524", "ISSNLinking": "2047-9980"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Machine Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residence Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "None."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Virani Salim S, Alonso A, Benjamin EJ, Bittencourt MS, Callaway CW, Carson AP, Chamberlain AM, Chang AR, Cheng S, Dellin FN, et al.
