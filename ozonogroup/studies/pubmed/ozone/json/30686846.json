Here, we applied combined acute ozone and wounding stresses to the constitutive isoprenoid-emitter <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> and studied how isoprene, 1,8-cineole, and isoledene synthase genes were regulated, and how the gene expression was associated with temporal changes in photosynthetic characteristics, product emission rates, and stomatal ozone uptake through recovery phase. Photosynthetic characteristics and emission rate of isoprene, 1,8-cineole, and isoledene were synergistically altered, while three TPS gene expressions were antagonistically altered by combined stress applications. A time-delay analysis indicated that the best correspondences between gene expression and product emission rates were observed for 0 h time-shift for wounding and 0-2 h time-shifts for separate ozone, and combined ozone and wounding treatments. The best correspondence between ozone uptake and gene expression was observed for 0-4 h time-shifts for separate ozone and combined ozone and wounding treatments. Overall, this study demonstrated that expression profiles of isoprene, the monoterpene 1,8-cineole, and the sesquiterpene isoledene synthase genes differentially influenced their corresponding product emissions for separate and combined ozone and wounding treatments through recovery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanagendran", "ForeName": "Arooran", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pazouki", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Pathology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bichele", "ForeName": "Rudolf", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science; Michigan Technological University, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00fclheim", "ForeName": "Carsten", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Estonian Academy of Sciences, Kohtu 6, 10130 Tallinn, Estonia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niinemets", "ForeName": "\u00dclo", "Initials": "\u00dc"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "322603", "Acronym": "ERC_", "Agency": "European Research Council", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "7610775", "ISSNLinking": "0098-8472"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of interest None."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Beauchamp J, Wisthaler A, Hansel A, Kleist E, Miebach M, Niinemets \u00dc, Schurr ULI, Wildt J.
