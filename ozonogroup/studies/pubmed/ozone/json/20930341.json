Apart from bacteria, certain viruses and fungi that are associated with periodontal disease are also present in the subgingival plaque .", "A randomized, double-blind, crossover split-mouth design was performed. A total of 16 patients suffering from generalized chronic periodontitis were selected for the study. The study period of 18 days was divided into two time-intervals, i.e. baseline (0 days) to 7 th day, with a washout period of 4 days followed by a second time interval of 7 days. The use of ozone and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) irrigation was randomized. Both the patient and the clinician evaluating the clinical parameters were blinded regarding the type of irrigation used.", "The interpretation of clinical and microbial data is from baseline to 7 th day. A higher percentage of plaque index (12%), gingival index (29%) and bleeding index (26%) reduction was observed using ozone irrigation as compared to chlorhexidine. The percentile reduction of Aa (25%) using ozone was appreciable as compared to no change in Aa occurrence using chlorhexidine. By using O 3 and chlorhexidine, there was no antibacterial effect on Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Tannerella forsythensis. The antifungal effect of ozone from baseline (37%) to 7 th day (12.5%) was pronounced during the study period, unlike CHX, which did not demonstrate any antifungal effect.", "Ozone may be considered as an alternative management strategy due to its powerful ability to inactivate microorganisms. Also, there is growing evidence that ozone can be employed as a useful therapeutic agent in both dentistry and medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics, College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kshitish", "ForeName": "Durga", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laxman", "ForeName": "Vandana K", "Initials": "VK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Dent Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9202990", "ISSNLinking": "0970-9290"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Aggressive Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteroides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytomegalovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Plaque Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gingival Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 2, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 4, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Porphyromonas gingivalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutic Irrigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20930341", "10.4103/0970-9290.70796", "IndianJDentRes_2010_21_3_341_70796"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
