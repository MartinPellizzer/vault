The most epressed improvement of indicators of the clinical and neurologic status (the eliminaton of motoring breakdown, eye movement disrders, the weaknesses of mimic, respiratory and chewing muscles, bulbar syndrome, the doubling in eye and ptosis, pharyngeal violations and increase in volume of movement of eyes) was observed in the group of patients receiving the combined therapy. The reduction of the epressiveness of the defeat of the neuromotor device and the decrement of the amplitude of the various degree of M-answer in patients with myasthenla is revealed in the application of the combined therapy in the comparison with the application of the basic and optimized therapy. For the first time we have investigaed the dynamics of the intensity of the expression of specfic peptides and proteins in blood serum in patients with the application of basic therapy, reamberin and ozonotherapy, which have allowed to open the new mechanisms of the efficiency ofthe combined therapy of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drozd", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Efremov", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Romantsov", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarvilina", "ForeName": "I V", "Initials": "IV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk", "NlmUniqueID": "9215641", "ISSNLinking": "0869-6047"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reamberin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6HG8UB2MUY", "NameOfSubstance": "Meglumine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.3.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electromyography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analogs & derivatives", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Meglumine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monitoring, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myasthenia Gravis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Succinate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Succinates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24000669", "10.15690/vramn.v68i5.664"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
