Exposure data are particularly vital but may cause great uncertainty in health burden assessments. This study, for the first time, used six methods to generate the concentration data of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in China between 2014 and 2018, and then quantified the changes in premature mortality due to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> using the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) model. The results show that PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related premature mortality in China decreases by 263 (95% confidence interval (CI95): 142-159) to 308 (CI95: 213-241) thousands from 2014 to 2018 by using different concentration data, while O<sub>3</sub>-related premature mortality increases by 67 (CI95: 26-104) to 103 (CI95: 40-163) thousands. The estimated mean changes are up to 40% different for the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related mortality, and up to 30% for the O<sub>3</sub>-related mortality if different exposure data are chosen. The most significant difference due to the exposure data is found in the areas with a population density of around 10<sup>3</sup> people/km<sup>2</sup>, mostly located in Central China, for both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Our results demonstrate that the exposure data source significantly affects mortality estimations and should thus be carefully considered in health burden assessments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
