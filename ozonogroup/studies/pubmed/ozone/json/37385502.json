This work developed an initial concentration-dispersion normalized PMF (ICDN-PMF) to reflect the changes in source emissions. The effects of photochemical losses for VOC species were corrected by estimating the initial data, and then applying dispersion normalization to reduce the impacts of atmospheric dispersion. Hourly speciated VOC data measured in Qingdao from March to May 2020 were utilized to test the method and had assessed its effectiveness. Underestimated solvent use and biogenic emissions contributions due to photochemical losses during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution (OP) period reached 4.4 and 3.8 times the non-O<sub>3</sub> pollution (NOP) period values, respectively. Increased solvent use contribution due to air dispersion during the OP period was 4.6 times the change in the NOP period. The influence of chemical conversion and air dispersion on the gasoline and diesel vehicle emissions was not apparent during either period. The ICDN-PMF results suggested that biogenic emissions (23.1\u00a0%), solvent use (23.0\u00a0%), motor-vehicle emissions (17.1\u00a0%), and natural gas and diesel evaporation (15.8\u00a0%) contributed most to ambient VOCs during the OP period. Biogenic emissions and solvent use contributions during the OP period increased by 187\u00a0% and 135\u00a0% compared with the NOP period, respectively, whereas that of liquefied petroleum gas substantially decreased during the OP period. Controlling solvent use and motor-vehicles could be effective in controlling VOCs in the OP period."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
