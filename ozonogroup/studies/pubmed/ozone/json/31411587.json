The results indicated that when adding 1 g/L of manganese/modified activated carbon catalyst and 1.5 g/min ozone flow, the COD could be degraded from 2,043.67 mg/L to 711.4 mg/L. After that, the COD could continue decreasing down to 72.56 mg/L through an air-cathode single chamber microbial fuel cell (SCMFCs), coated with 0.4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> platinum catalyst, after 15 days. Meanwhile, the maximum voltages and the ultimate power density of the SCMFCs reached 378.96 mV and 7,608.35 mW/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. For filter residue, when 1.2 g/L Fe<sup>3+</sup>, 10% (m/v) filter residue, and 10% Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were added, the copper leaching rate could reach 92.69% after 7 days if the pH values were adjusted to 1.9. Furthermore, the other heavy metals were also decreased to a level lower than the pollution control standard (Chinese standard GB3838-2002). The leaching parameters in terms of pH, redox potential, and cyclic voltammetry showed that the addition of an appropriate concentration of Fe<sup>3+</sup> to the leaching systems was beneficial to copper dissolution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China E-mail: ylfeng126@126.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Zhenzhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China E-mail: ylfeng126@126.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yali", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Haoran", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Zhuwei", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acidithiobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioelectric Energy Sources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31411587", "10.2166/wst.2019.232"]}}]}
