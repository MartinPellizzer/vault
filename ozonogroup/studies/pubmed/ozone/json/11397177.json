Naphthalenecarboxylic acid esters 8 and 11 and naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid diester 16 were similarly nitrated in the absence of catalyst to give the expected nitro compounds 9/10, 12-15, and 17-22, respectively. Different from conventional nitration based on the combined use of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids, no hydrolytic cleavage of the ester function was observed under these conditions. The isomer distribution has been determined for the nitration of naphthalenecarboxylic acid esters 8, 11, and 16, and spectral data were collected for less common nitro derivatives. A unique changeover of the orientation mode observed in the kyodai nitration of diester 16, from the initial exclusive meta to the final meta/para, has been discussed in terms of the competition between the electrophilic substitution process involving the nitronium ion (NO2+) and the addition-elimination sequence involving the nitrogen trioxide radical (*NO3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Kwansei Gakuin University, Uegahara, Nishinomiya 662-8501, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nose", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11397177", "10.1021/jo015619d", "jo015619d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
