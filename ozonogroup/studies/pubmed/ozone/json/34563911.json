In order to better understand the characteristics, sources and health risks of VHCs in typical urban areas in Beijing, and also verify the achievement in implementing the Montreal Protocol (MP) in Beijing, observational studies on 22 atmospheric VHCs species were conducted during six air pollution episodes from December 2016 to May 2017. The range in daily mixing ratios of the 6 MP-regulated VHCs was 1000-1168\u00a0pptv, and the 16 MP-unregulated VHCs was 452-2961\u00a0pptv. The 16 MP-unregulated VHCs accounted for a relatively high concentration proportion among the 22 VHCs with a mean of 70.25%. Compared with other regions, the mixing ratios of MP-regulated VHCs were in the middle concentrations. The mixing ratios of the MP-regulated VHCs remained the same concentrations during the air pollution episodes, while the concentrations of MP-unregulated VHCs were generally higher on polluted days than on clean days and increased with the aggravation of the pollution episodes. The mixing ratios of dichlorodifluoromethane and trichlorofluoromethane were higher than Northern Hemisphere (NH) background values, while the mixing ratios of the other 4 MP-regulated VHCs were moderate and similar to the NH background values. All the 9 VHCs with carcinogenic risk might pose potential carcinogenic risks to the exposed populations in the six pollution episodes, while none of the 12 VHCs might pose appreciable non-carcinogenic risks to the exposed populations. Considering the higher concentration levels and higher risk values of 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride and trichloromethane, Beijing needs to further strengthen the control of these VHCs. The analysis of air mass transportation and PMF model showed that regional transportation and leakage of CFCs banks were important sources of VHCs in Beijing, and the contribution of industrial process and solvent usage should not be neglected. The results revealed the effective implementation of the MP in Beijing and its surrounding areas, while further measures are suggested to control the emissions of important VHCs especially from regional transportation and leakage of CFCs banks to reduce the possible health risks to the exposed population."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
