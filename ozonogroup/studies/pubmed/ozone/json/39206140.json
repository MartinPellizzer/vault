Recent work has identified lower volatility, reactive organic carbon from asphalt as an overlooked source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursor emissions. Here, we leverage potential emission estimates and usage data to construct a bottom-up inventory of asphalt-related emissions in the United States. In 2018, we estimate that hot-mix, warm-mix, emulsified, cutback, and roofing asphalt generated ~380 Gg (317 Gg - 447 Gg) of organic compound emissions. The impacts of these emissions on anthropogenic SOA and ozone throughout the contiguous United States are estimated using photochemical modeling. In several major cities, asphalt-related emissions can increase modeled summertime SOA, on average, by 0.1 - 0.2 \u03bcg m-3 (2-4% of SOA) and may reach up to 0.5 \u03bcg m-3 at noontime on select days. The influence of asphalt-related emissions on modeled ozone are generally small (~0.1 ppb). We estimate that asphalt paving-related emissions are half of what they were nearly 50 years ago, largely due to the concerted efforts to reduce emissions from cutback asphalts. If on-road mobile emissions continue their multidecadal decline, contributions of urban SOA from evaporative and non-road mobile sources will continue to grow in relative importance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air and Radiation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seltzer", "ForeName": "Karl M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air and Radiation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Venkatesh", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pye", "ForeName": "Havala O T", "Initials": "HOT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "Benjamin N", "Initials": "BN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Engineering (ORISE) Postdoctoral Program at the Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Place", "ForeName": "Bryan K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Paul Scherrer Institute, 5232 Villigen, Aargau, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khare", "ForeName": "Peeyush", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gentner", "ForeName": "Drew R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Dynamics Information Technology, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Christine", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abt Associates, 5001 South Miami Boulevard, Suite 210, Durham, NC 27703."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cooley", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air and Radiation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mason", "ForeName": "Rich", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air and Radiation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 TW Alexander Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Houyoux", "ForeName": "Marc", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Atmos", "NlmUniqueID": "9918227365506676", "ISSNLinking": "2634-3606"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Asphalt Institute, 2018 Asphalt Usage Survey for the United States and Canada, A.
