We used Poisson regression in a time-series framework to estimate the increased risk for asthma-related ED visits from exposure to ambient SO2, PM2.5 and ozone during the warm season (April-September) and SO2 and PM2.5 during the cold (October-March) season, from 2007 to 2011. Our models controlled for measured confounders, including weather and respiratory infections, as well as unmeasured confounders using a natural cubic spline to account for long-term seasonal trends.", "During 2007-2011 in Indianapolis, 165,056 asthma-related ED visits occurred. We found statistically significant positive associations (p\u2009<\u20090.05) between ambient air pollutants and ED visits during the warm season for persons aged 5-44 years. Interquartile range increases in daily ozone concentrations with same day, 2-day lagged, and 3-day moving average were associated with increased risks for ED visits of 3.2% (95% CI: 0.2%, 6.3%), 4.4% (0.1%, 8.9%) and 4.8% (0.2%, 9.6%), respectively. Interquartile range increases in 3-day moving averages for SO2 were associated with an increased risk of 3.3% (95% CI: 0.2%, 6.5%). We identified statistically significant associations (p\u2009<\u20090.05) between increased SO2 and PM2.5 levels and decreased ED visits among some age groups, primarily during the cold season, and no significant positive associations between changes in PM2.5 concentration and asthma-related ED visits.", "During the warm season, increases in ozone and SO2 concentrations were associated with increased asthma morbidity in children and young adults in Indianapolis. These results will enable reliable estimation of the health impacts of increases in these pollutants on asthma-related ED visits in Indianapolis and similar communities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Indiana Department of Environmental Management , Indianapolis , IN , USA ."}], "LastName": "Byers", "ForeName": "Nathan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , GA , USA ."}], "LastName": "Ritchey", "ForeName": "Matthew", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , GA , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Vaidyanathan", "ForeName": "Ambarish", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Indiana State Department of Health , Indianapolis , IN , USA."}], "LastName": "Brandt", "ForeName": "Amy J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , GA , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Yip", "ForeName": "Fuyuen", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26517197", "10.3109/02770903.2015.1091006"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
