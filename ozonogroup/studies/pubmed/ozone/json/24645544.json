In this paper, sodium acetate (according to chemical oxygen demand [COD]) was selected as the model pollutant in water, and the degradation efficiencies and mechanism of sodium acetate in water by ozone oxidation were investigated. The results showed that the ozone oxidation was an effective treatment technology for advanced treatment of sodium acetate in water; the COD removal rate obtained the maximum value of 45.89% from sodium acetate solution when the pH value was 10.82, ozone concentration was 100 mg/L, reaction time was 30 minutes, and reaction temperature was 25 degrees C. The COD removal rate increased first and decreased subsequently with the bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration from 0 to 200 mg/L, the largest decline being 20.35%. The COD removal rate declined by 25.38% with the carbonate (CO3(2-)) concentration from 0 to 200 mg/L; CO3(2-) has a more obvious scavenging effect to inhibit the formation of hydroxyl free radicals than HCO3-. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) could enhance the COD removal rate greatly; they could reach 77.35 and 96.53%, respectively, after a reaction time of 30 minutes, which was increased by 31.46 and 50.64%, respectively, compared with only ozone oxidation. It was proved that the main ozone oxidation product of sodium acetate was carbon dioxide (CO2), and the degradation of sodium acetate in the ozone oxidation process followed the mechanism of hydroxyl free radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "De-Min", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Jian-Mei", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4550K0SC9B", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M4I0D6VV5M", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PF5DZW74VN", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Hydroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24645544", "10.2175/106143013x13807328849134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
