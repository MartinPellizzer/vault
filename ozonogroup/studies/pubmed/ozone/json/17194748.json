The authors collected data on over 4 million emergency department visits from 31 hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia, between January 1993 and August 2000. Visits for cardiovascular disease were examined in relation to levels of ambient pollutants by use of a case-crossover framework. Heterogeneity of risk was examined for several comorbid conditions. The results included evidence of stronger associations of dysrhythmia and congestive heart failure visits with comorbid hypertension in relation to increased air pollution levels compared with visits without comorbid hypertension; similar evidence of effect modification by diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was observed for dysrhythmia and peripheral and cerebrovascular disease visits, respectively. Evidence of effect modification by comorbid hypertension and diabetes was observed in relation to particulate matter less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, while evidence of effect modification by comorbid COPD was also observed in response to ozone levels. These findings provide further evidence of increased susceptibility to adverse cardiovascular events associated with ambient air pollution among persons with hypertension, diabetes, and COPD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. jpeel@colostate.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peel", "ForeName": "Jennifer L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Metzger", "ForeName": "Kristi Busico", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klein", "ForeName": "Mitchel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flanders", "ForeName": "W Dana", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulholland", "ForeName": "James A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tolbert", "ForeName": "Paige E", "Initials": "PE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES 11294", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7910653", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9262"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comorbidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Georgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Surveillance"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17194748", "10.1093/aje/kwk051", "kwk051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
