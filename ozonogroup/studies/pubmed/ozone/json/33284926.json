We present a kinetic study on surface coatings of self-assembled (semi-solid) oleic acid-sodium oleate cooking aerosol proxies undergoing ozonolysis. We found clear film thickness-dependent kinetic behaviour and measured the effect of the organic phase on the kinetics for this system. In addition to the thickness-dependent kinetics, we show that significant fractions of unreacted proxy remain after extensive ozone exposure and that this effect scales approximately linearly with film thickness, suggesting that a late-stage inert reaction product may form and inhibit reaction progress - effectively building up an inert crust. We determine this by using a range of simultaneous analytical techniques; most notably Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) has been used for the first time to measure the reaction kinetics of films of a wide range of thicknesses from ca. 0.59 to 73 \u03bcm with films <10 \u03bcm thick being of potential atmospheric relevance. These observations have implications for the evolution of particulate matter in the urban environment, potentially extending the atmospheric lifetimes of harmful aerosol components and affecting the local urban air quality and climate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Birmingham, School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK. c.pfrang@bham.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Milsom", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Squires", "ForeName": "Adam M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Woden", "ForeName": "Ben", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Terrill", "ForeName": "Nicholas J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "Andrew D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pfrang", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Faraday Discuss", "NlmUniqueID": "9212301", "ISSNLinking": "1359-6640"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scattering, Small Angle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33284926", "10.1039/d0fd00088d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
