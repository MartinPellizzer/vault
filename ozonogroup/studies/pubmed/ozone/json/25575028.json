Associations were estimated for interquartile range changes in each pollutant. To allow comparison of relationships among multiple pollutants and outcomes with potentially different lag structures, we used 3-day unconstrained distributed lag models controlling for time trends and meteorology.", "Considering results of our primary models, as well as sensitivity analyses and models assessing co-pollutant confounding, we observed robust associations of cardiovascular disease visits with 17\u03b1(H),21\u03b2(H)-hopane and congestive heart failure visits with elemental carbon. We also observed a robust association of respiratory disease visits with ozone. For asthma/wheeze, associations were strongest with ozone and nitrogen dioxide; observed associations of asthma/wheeze with PM2.5 and its components were attenuated in two-pollutant models with these gases. Differential measurement error due to differential patterns of spatiotemporal variability may have influenced patterns of observed associations across pollutants.", "Our findings add to the growing field examining the health effects of PM2.5 components. Combustion-related components of the pollutant mix showed particularly strong associations with cardiorespiratory ED visit outcomes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}], "LastName": "Sarnat", "ForeName": "Stefanie Ebelt", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Winquist", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schauer", "ForeName": "James J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Turner", "ForeName": "Jay R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sarnat", "ForeName": "Jeremy A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Illinois"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Missouri"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}], "CoiStatement": "The contents of this article are solely the responsibility of the grantee and do not necessarily represent the official views of the U.S. EPA.
