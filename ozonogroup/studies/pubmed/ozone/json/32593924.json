The average total VOC (TVOC) concentration was 30.6\u00a0ppbv during the heating season. The alkanes accounted for highest proportion of the TVOC, while the alkenes were the predominant species forming ozone, especially ethylene. Compared to the clean period, the concentration of acetylene during the haze events showed highest increase rate, followed by the ethane; and the concentrations and proportions of alkanes and alkenes were highest during the growth stage (GS) of haze events. The multi-scale apportionment results suggested petrochemical industry and solvent usage (PI/SU, 31.2%), vehicle emissions and liquefied petroleum gas (VE/LPG, 20.5%), and combustion emissions (CE, 19.1%) were the main VOC sources during the heating season. Compared to the clean period, the contributions of PI/SU, VE/LPG, CE, and refinery emissions notably increased during the haze events, while that of gasoline evaporation decreased. The contributions of PI/SU and RPI showed significantly increase during the GS of haze events, whereas most sources decreased during the dissipation stage of haze events. Diurnal-variations in source contributions during the haze events were clearer than the clean period, and the contributions of PI/SU, VE/LPG, and CE during the haze events were markedly higher at night. These findings provide valuable information to inform effective VOC control and prevention measures with specific relevance for the control of ozone pollution in Tianjin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
