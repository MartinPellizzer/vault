Taurine protects against bronchiolar damage induced by NO2, ozone, bleomycin, and amiodarone. Taurine is chlorinated to form taurine chloramine (Tau-Cl) by the halide-dependent myeloperoxidase system and, under physiological conditions, reduces HOCl toxicity. Although NO and its metabolites, NO2- and NO3-, are thought to be major mediators of tissue damage resulting from oxidant exposure, cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), are also involved. We examined the effects of Tau-Cl on NO production and TNF release by using RAW 264.7 cells activated with recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma; 50 U/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 micrograms/ml). NO was measured spectrophotometrically as NO2- after reaction with Griess reagent and TNF was measured by ELISA. Tau-Cl (0.5 mM) inhibits NO and TNF released into the medium by 47% and 43%, respectively. Tau-Cl is actively transported into RAW 264.7 cells by an uptake system that is energy, temperature, and Na+ dependent. Competition experiments demonstrate that the uptake system for Tau-Cl is distinct from that for taurine. In addition, the NO synthase activity of cytosolic preparations from activated RAW 264.7 cells is irreversibly inhibited by pretreatment with Tau-Cl. We demonstrate that Tau-Cl inhibits production of NO and TNF by activated macrophages and suggest a mechanism through which taurine supplementation may protect against oxidant-induced tissue damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island 10314."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quinn", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schuller-Levis", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Leukoc Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8405628", "ISSNLinking": "0741-5400"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1EQV5MLY3D", "NameOfSubstance": "Taurine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "51036-13-6", "NameOfSubstance": "N-chlorotaurine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophage Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taurine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7689627", "10.1002/jlb.54.2.119"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
