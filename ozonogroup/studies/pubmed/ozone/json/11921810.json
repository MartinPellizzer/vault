To stabilize the results in atmospheric retrievals, constraints are used in the iteration process. Therefore hard constraints (discretization of the retrieval grid) and soft constraints (regularization operators) are included in the retrieval. Tikhonov regularization is often used as a soft constraint. In this study, different types of Tikhonov operator were compared, and several new methods were developed to determine the optimal strength of the constraint operationally. The resulting regularization parameters were applied successfully to an ozone retrieval from simulated nadir sounding spectra like those expected to be measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer, which is part of the Aura platform. Retrievals were characterized by means of estimated error, averaging kernel, vertical resolution, and degrees of freedom."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, M.S. 183-301, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, California 91109, USA. tilman.steck@imk.fzk.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steck", "ForeName": "Tilman", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11921810", "10.1364/ao.41.001788"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
