Drastic visible necrotic damage to leaf by ozone and consequent increase in ascorbate peroxidase protein(s) was accompanied by rapid changes in the 2-DE protein profiles, over controls. Out of a total of 56 proteins investigated, which were reproducible in repeated experiments, 52 protein spots were visually identified as differentially expressed over controls. Six proteins were N-terminally blocked, and the sequence of 14 proteins could not be determined, whereas 36 proteins were N-terminally and one was internally sequenced. Ozone caused drastic reductions in the major leaf photosynthetic proteins, including the abundantly present ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, and induction of various defense/stress related proteins. Most prominent change in leaves, within 24 h post-treatment with ozone, was the induced accumulation of a pathogenesis related (PR) class 5 protein, three PR 10 class proteins, ascorbate peroxidase(s), superoxide dismutase, calcium-binding protein, calreticulin, a novel ATP-dependent CLP protease, and an unknown protein. Present results demonstrate the highly damaging effect of ozone on rice seedlings at the level of the proteome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory for Agricultural Biotechnology and Biochemistry (RLABB), Kathmandu, Nepal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Ganesh Kumar", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rakwal", "ForeName": "Randeep", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yonekura", "ForeName": "Masami", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saji", "ForeName": "Hikaru", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Proteomics", "NlmUniqueID": "101092707", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9853"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteome"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pathogenesis-related proteins, plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbate Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteome"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12203890", "10.1002/1615-9861(200208)2:8<947::AID-PROT947>3.0.CO;2-J"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
