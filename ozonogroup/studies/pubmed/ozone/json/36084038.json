Annual air pollution exposures were assigned by linking residential addresses with hybrid estimates of air pollutant concentrations at 1-km2 resolution. Body size was measured, and body composition was measured using DXA at approximately annual visits. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the associations between air pollution and body size and composition measures and whether these associations differed by physical activity.", "After adjusting for potential confounders, an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 concentration (4.5 \u03bcg/m3) was associated with 4.53% (95% CI 3.85%, 5.22%) higher fat mass, 1.10% (95% CI 0.95%, 1.25%) higher proportion fat mass, and 0.39% (95% CI -0.77%, -0.01%) lower lean mass.
