In general, most of metal oxide catalysts for removal of organic compounds need higher temperature than the ambient temperature, but Mn-based catalysts shows activity for prevalent organic pollutants even at room temperature with ozone. For the removal of toluene at room temperature without further heating, bimetallic Ru added Mn catalysts were applied in combination with different zeolite supports. The catalytic activity of the Ru-Mn catalysts strongly depended on the zeolite, of which the characteristics such as acidity and adsorption degree of toluene are dependent on the ratio of SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Among the five Ru-Mn catalysts used, Ru-Mn/HY (SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratio: 80) and Ru-Mn/ZSM-5 (SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratio: 80) had higher toluene and ozone removal efficiencies. The toluene removal efficiency of Ru-Mn/zeolites was proportional to the pore volume and surface area. In terms of ozone degradation, Ru-Mn/HY(80) and Ru-Mn/HZSM-5(80) had the highest removal efficiencies. Overall, the catalytic ozone oxidation of toluene using Ru-Mn/zeolites seemed to be affected by a combination of the acidic properties of zeolites, Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>4+</sup> ratio, and concentration ratio of oxygen vacancies to oxygen lattices on the catalyst surface."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
