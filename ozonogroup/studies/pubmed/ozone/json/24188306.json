In the same era, industrial developments made it easier to meet the requirements for processed foods. However, consumers are now interested in minimally processed foods owing to increase in their awareness to have fruits and vegetables with superior quality, and natural integrity with fewer additives. The food products deteriorate as a consequence of physiological aging, biochemical changes, high respiration rat,e and high ethylene production. These factors contribute substantially to discoloration, loss of firmness, development of off-flavors, acidification, and microbial spoilage. Simultaneously, food processors are using emerging approaches to process perishable commodities, along with enhanced nutritional and sensorial quality. The present review article is an effort to utilize the modern approaches to minimize the processing and deterioration. The techniques discussed in this paper include chlorination, ozonation, irradiation, photosensitization, edible coating, natural preservative use, high-pressure processing, microwave heating, ohmic heating, and hurdle technology. The consequences of these techniques on shelf-life stability, microbial safety, preservation of organoleptic and nutritional quality, and residue avoidance are the limelight of the paper. Moreover, the discussion has been made on the feasibility and operability of these techniques in modern-day processing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Institute of Food Science and Technology , University of Agriculture , Faisalabad , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Pasha", "ForeName": "Imran", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saeed", "ForeName": "Farhan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sultan", "ForeName": "M Tauseef", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Moazzam Rafiq", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rohi", "ForeName": "Madiha", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Food Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24188306", "10.1080/10408398.2011.585254"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
