In this work, we determined the photodissociation cross section of ClOOCl at 330 nm with a molecular beam and with mass-resolved detection. The photodissociation cross section is the product of the absorption cross section and the dissociation quantum yield. We formed an effusive molecular beam of ClOOCl at a nozzle temperature of 200 or 250 K and determined its photodissociation probability by measuring the decrease of the ClOOCl intensity upon laser irradiation. By comparing with a reference molecule (Cl(2)), of which the absorption cross section and dissociation quantum yield are well-known, we determined the absolute photodissociation cross section of ClOOCl at 330 nm to be (2.31 +/- 0.11) x 10(-19) cm(2) at 200 K and (2.47 +/- 0.12) x 10(-19) cm(2) at 250 K. Impurity interference has been a well-recognized problem in conventional spectroscopic studies of ClOOCl; our mass-resolved measurement directly overcomes such a problem. This measurement of the ClOOCl photolysis cross section at 330 nm is particularly useful in constraining its atmospheric photolysis rate, which in the polar stratosphere peaks near this wavelength."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 10617, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "I-Cheng", "Initials": "IC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wen-Tsung", "Initials": "WT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lien", "ForeName": "Chien-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guchhait", "ForeName": "Nikhil", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jim J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20085296", "10.1021/jp909374k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
