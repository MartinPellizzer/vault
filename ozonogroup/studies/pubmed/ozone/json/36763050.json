Ozone directly kills tumor cells by generating reactive oxygen species <i>in vitro</i>, but its high reactivity and short half-life severely limit its tumor accumulation and penetration for the treatment of tumors <i>in vivo</i>. Herein, a thermoresponsive ozone-enriched spray gel is developed to suppress the tumor recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7 tumors). Briefly, a perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion (PFTBA@LIP) consisting of a perfluorotributylamine core and a lipid monolayer is fabricated, which is encapsulated in the thermoresponsive hydrogel. Ozone is then dissolved in the nanoemulsion owing to its high affinity to PFTBA (O<sub>3</sub>/PFTBA@LIP@Gel), which effectively improves its stability. Of note is that O<sub>3</sub>/PFTBA@LIP@Gel induces both ferroptosis and apoptosis by regulating the expression of relevant genes (GPX4, ACSL4, CDKN1A, <i>etc</i>.) and inducing considerable lipid peroxidation, which significantly reduces the tumor recurrence of the Huh-7 tumor by spraying the gel in the surgical cavity and prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9930-5300"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, International Cancer Center, Laboratory of Evolutionary Theranostics (LET), School of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen 518060, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yifan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, International Cancer Center, Laboratory of Evolutionary Theranostics (LET), School of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen 518060, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chenqing", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8570-6779"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Boda", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chunying", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9865-2098"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, International Cancer Center, Laboratory of Evolutionary Theranostics (LET), School of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen 518060, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3651-7813"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, International Cancer Center, Laboratory of Evolutionary Theranostics (LET), School of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen 518060, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36763050", "10.1021/acsnano.2c09893"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
