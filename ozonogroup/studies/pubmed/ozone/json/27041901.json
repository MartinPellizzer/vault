The ozonized olive oil was applied twice daily until the lesion regresses for a maximum of 6 months.", "All the lesions regress in patients with aphthous ulcerations, herpes labialis, oral candidiasis and angular cheilitis or showed improvement in the signs and symptoms in oral lichen planus patients.
