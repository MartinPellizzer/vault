Vegetative cells on beef surfaces at an initial concentration of 5.59 +/- 0.17 log CFU/g were reduced significantly (P < 0.05) to 4.09 +/- 0.72 log CFU/g and 3.50 +/- 0.90 log CFU/g after combined treatments with aqueous ozone (5 ppm) and subsequent heating at 45 and 55 degrees C, respectively. Spores on the beef surface were likewise significantly reduced from an initial concentration of 2.94 +/- 0.37 log spores per g to 2.07 +/- 0.38 log spores per g and 1.70 +/- 0.37 log spores per g after the combined treatment with aqueous ozone (5 ppm) and subsequent heating at 55 and 75 degrees C, respectively. Fluorescent nucleic acid stains were used with confocal fluorescence microscopy to show that spores remaining attached to the meat were protected from treatment-specific injury. This study provides evidence for the decreased resistance of both vegetative cells and spores of C. perfringens with ozone treatment that is followed by heat treatment at temperatures that would not otherwise be as effective, thus lowering the requirements for cooking beef while maintaining a margin of safety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Food Safety Research Unit, US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Eastern Regional Research Center, 600 East Memiaid Lane, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania 19038, USA. jnovak@errc.ars.usda.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Novak", "ForeName": "John S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "James T C", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium perfringens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Spores, Bacterial"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14968967", "10.4315/0362-028x-67.2.342", "S0362-028X(22)03421-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
