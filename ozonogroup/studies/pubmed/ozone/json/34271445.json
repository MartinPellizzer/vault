Although ozone was highly effective in inactivating fungi in water, it was limited by a lack of continuous disinfection ability in water supply system. In present study, the inactivation of fungal spores by combining ozone and chlorine was investigated. The synergistic effects of Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma harzianum spores reached 0.47- and 0.55-log within 10\u00a0min, respectively. The inactivation efficiency and the synergistic effect would be affected by disinfectant concentration, pH, and temperature. The combined inactivation caused more violent oxidative stimulation and more severe damage to the fungal spores than the individual inactivation based on the flow cytometry analysis and the scanning electron microscopy observation. The synergistic effect during the combined inactivation process was attributed to the generation of hydroxyl radicals by the reaction between ozone and chlorine and the promotion of chlorine penetration by the destruction of cell wall by ozone. The combined inactivation efficiency in natural water samples was reduced by 26.4-43.8% compared with that in PBS. The results of this study provided an efficient and feasible disinfection method for the control of fungi in drinking water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
