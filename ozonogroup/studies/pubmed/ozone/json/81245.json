Rates of bacterial ingestion and the activities of cellular acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were measured simultaneously in in situ perfused right lungs by sequential staining of frozen sections for enzyme and bacteria. Quantitative measurements of enzyme activity within macrophages without ingested bacteria were made with a computer-controlled cytospectrophotometry system. Exposure to ozone resulted in diminished rates of bacterial clearance and ingestion, large increases in numbers of intra- and extracellular staphylococcal microcolonies, and an absence of enzyme activity for macrophages containing bacterial microcolonies. Enzyme activity was unimpaired in macrophages without ingested bacteria. These results, in which absence of enzyme activity occurred only in macrophages subjected to the dual insults of ozone exposure and ingested bacteria, prove a relationship between impairment in bactericidal capacity and cellular activities of lysosomal enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bartlema", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van der Ploeg", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Duijn", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van der Stap", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lippert", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Infect Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0413675", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lysosomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staining and Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcal Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["81245", "10.1093/infdis/138.3.299"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
