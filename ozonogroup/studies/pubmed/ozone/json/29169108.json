Whereas O<sub>3</sub> did not induce mutagenicity, O<sub>3</sub>/Cl, AOP, and AOP/Cl converted 3M4NP into mutagenic transformation products (TPs). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we detected a total of 138 peaks in the solutions subjected to O<sub>3</sub>/Cl, AOP, and AOP/Cl. To elucidate the TPs responsible for the observed mutagenicity, we performed simple regression analyses of the relationship between the area of each peak and the observed mutagenicity of samples withdrawn periodically during each oxidation process. The area of each of 10 peaks was found to be positively correlated (r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.8) with the observed mutagenicity, suggesting that the TPs corresponding to these peaks contributed to the mutagenicity. After taking into account the consistency of mutagenicity induction by the oxidation processes and analyzing the peaks by tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 3\u00a0TPs, corresponding to 6 peaks, as candidate mutagens. These TPs were assessed by means of 4 quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, and all 3 were predicted to be mutagenic by at least one model. This result was consistent with our assumption that these TPs were mutagens. Ames assays of an authentic sample of one of the 3\u00a0TPs revealed that it did not contribute to the mutagenicity. This left 3-methoxy-4-nitrophenol and 2-[(E)-[(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl) methylidene]amino]-5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde on the list of mutagens suspected of contributing to the mutagenicity induced by AOP. No TPs were identified as candidate mutagens responsible for the mutagenicity induced by O<sub>3</sub>/Cl and AOP/Cl."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
