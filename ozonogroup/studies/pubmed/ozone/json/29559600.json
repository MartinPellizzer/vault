The treatment group was showered with ozonated water (3-5 times a week) and smeared with ozonated oil (twice a day), while the control group was washed with warm running water and smeared with base oil, adding moisturizer if necessary. The treatment course was 2 weeks. Efficacy and side effect were evaluated.\u2029 Results: The skin exudation was reduced and erosion was healing after 3-5 days topical ozone therapy for infantile atopic dermatitis. The effective rates were 80.0% and 20.0% in the treatment group and control group for 1 week, and 89.6% and 30.7% for 2 weeks, respectively, with significant difference between the 2 groups (P<0. 001).\u2029 Conclusion: Innovative treatment of infantile atopic dermatitis with topical ozone application is safe and effective, which is worth popularizing in clinic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Longhua Distric Central Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen Guangdong 518110, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Guizhi", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jinhua", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yizhi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Yaping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Chunxiang", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jianyun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban", "NlmUniqueID": "101230586", "ISSNLinking": "1672-7347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Baths"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapies, Investigational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29559600", "10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2018.02.010"]}}]}
