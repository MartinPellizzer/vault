Daily mean levels of particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) were obtained from local monitoring stations. We determined the association of the preceding week's pollutant levels with symptom scores and respiratory tract infections using a generalized additive mixed model with an autoregressive component. In addition, we assessed whether neonatal lung function influences this association and whether duration of infectious episodes differed between weeks with normal PM10 and weeks with elevated levels.", "We found a significant association between air pollution and respiratory symptoms, particularly in the week after respiratory tract infections (risk ratio, 1.13 [1.02-1.24] per 10 \u03bcg/m(3) PM10 levels) and in infants with premorbid lung function. During times of elevated PM10 (>33.3 \u03bcg/m(3)), duration of respiratory tract infections increased by 20% (95% confidence interval, 2-42%).", "Exposure to even moderate levels of air pollution was associated with increased respiratory symptoms in healthy infants. Particularly in infants with premorbid lung function and inflammation, air pollution contributed to longer duration of infectious episodes with a potentially large socioeconomic impact."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stern", "ForeName": "Georgette", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Latzin", "ForeName": "Philipp", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "R\u00f6\u00f6sli", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuchs", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Proietti", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuehni", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frey", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23594341", "10.1164/rccm.201211-2008OC"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
