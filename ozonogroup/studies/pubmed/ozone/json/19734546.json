We analysed the isotopic composition in leaf bulk, leaf cellulose, phloem and xylem material and related the results to (a) meteorological data (air temperature, T and relative humidity, RH), (b) leaf gas exchange measurements (stomatal conductance, g(s); transpiration rate, E; and maximum photosynthetic activity, A(max)) and (c) the outcome of a steady-state evaporative enrichment model. Delta13C was significantly lower in the shade than in the sun crown in all plant materials, whilst Delta18O was increased significantly in the shade than in the sun crown in bulk material and cellulose. Elevated ozone had no effect on delta13C, although Delta18O was influenced by ozone to varied degrees during single months. We observed significant seasonal changes for both parameters, especially in 2004, and also significant differences between the study years. Relating the findings to meteorological data and gas exchange parameters, we conclude that the differences in Delta18O between the sun and the shade crown were predominantly caused by the P\u00e9clet effect. This assumption was supported by the modelled Delta18O values for leaf cellulose. It was demonstrated that independent of RH, light-dependent reduction of stomatal conductance (and thus transpiration) and of A(max) can drive the pattern of Delta18O increase with the concomitant decrease of delta13C in the shade crown. The effect of doubling ozone levels on time-integrated stomatal conductance and transpiration as indicated by the combined analysis of Delta18O and delta13C was much lower than the influence caused by the light exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Systems Biology (ZBSA), Core Facility Metabolomics, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Habsburgerstrasse 49, 79104 Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gessler", "ForeName": "Arthur", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f6w", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heerdt", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Beeck", "ForeName": "Maarten Op", "Initials": "MO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schumacher", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grams", "ForeName": "Thorsten E E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bahnweg", "ForeName": "G\u00fcnther", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ceulemans", "ForeName": "Reinhart", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Werner", "ForeName": "Herbert", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "Rainer", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rennenberg", "ForeName": "Heinz", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haberer", "ForeName": "Kristine", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phloem"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Xylem"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19734546", "10.1093/treephys/tpp066", "tpp066"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
