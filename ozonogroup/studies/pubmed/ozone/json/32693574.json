In this work, a highly selective sensor with dual functions has been fabricated via facile postmodification of the UiO-MOF. Butene modified salicylaldehyde is covalently linked to the UiO-66 scaffold via an efficient Schiff-base reaction, resulting in a highly fluorescent ozone sensor of UiO-66-butene. Ozonolysis of the terminal olefin followed by \u03b2-elimination could significantly quench the bright blue fluorescence of UiO-66-butene, and linear turn-off detection of ozone in the range of 0-100 \u03bcM is well established. The detection is highly sensitive and selective, and a detection limit of 73 nM was calculated. Remarkably, the ozonolysis afforded product could further act as a selective sensor for Al<sup>3+</sup> via turn-on fluorescence with a detection limit of 142 nM, representing a second potential sensing function. The chemically selective sequential ozonolysis/\u03b2-elimination and remarkable dual functions offer the exclusive detection of ozone over other oxidative species as well as Al<sup>3+</sup> over other cations following a tandem process, representing the first example of a direct MOF sensor for dual sensing of ozone and Al<sup>3+</sup>. This work demonstrates the potential of employing combinatorial principles for fabricating highly selective sensors, and postmodification of MOFs represents a promising facile strategy for developing various functional sensors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5605-0731"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Technology in Environmental Protection of Jiangsu Province, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng 224051, PR China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7959-6163"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Technology in Environmental Protection of Jiangsu Province, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng 224051, PR China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Ming-Hua", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Technology in Environmental Protection of Jiangsu Province, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng 224051, PR China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Technology in Environmental Protection of Jiangsu Province, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng 224051, PR China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Technology in Environmental Protection of Jiangsu Province, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng 224051, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zang", "ForeName": "Rong-Bin", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Advanced Technology in Environmental Protection of Jiangsu Province, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng 224051, PR China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Rong-Feng", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6507-9077"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering & Center for Atomic Engineering of Advanced Materials & AnHui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, PR China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32693574", "10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01082"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
