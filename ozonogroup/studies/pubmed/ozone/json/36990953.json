Data regarding the impact of long-term air pollution exposure on ischemic stroke mortality are sparse.", "The German nationwide inpatient sample was used to analyse all cases of hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke in Germany 2015-2019, which were stratified according to their residency. Data of the German Federal Environmental Agency regarding average values of air pollutants were assessed from 2015 to 2019 at district-level. Data were combined and the impact of different air pollution parameters on in-hospital case-fatality was analyzed.", "Overall, 1,505,496 hospitalizations of patients with ischemic stroke (47.7% females; 67.4\u00a0% \u226570\u00a0years old) were counted in Germany 2015-2019, of whom 8.2\u00a0% died during hospitalization. When comparing patients with residency in federal districts with high vs. low long-term air pollution, enhanced levels of benzene (OR 1.082 [95%CI 1.034-1.132],P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), ozone (O<sub>3,</sub> OR 1.123 [95%CI 1.070-1.178],P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), nitric oxide (NO, OR 1.076 [95%CI 1.027-1.127],P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> fine particulate matter concentrations (OR 1.126 [95%CI 1.074-1.180],P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were significantly associated with increased case-fatality independent from age, sex, cardiovascular risk-factors, comorbidities, and revascularization treatments. Conversely, enhanced carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM<sub>10,</sub> and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations were not significantly associated with stroke mortality. However, SO<sub>2</sub><sub>-</sub>concentrations were significantly associated with stroke-case-fatality rate of >8\u00a0% independent of residence area-type and area use (OR 1.518 [95%CI 1.012-2.278],P\u00a0=\u00a00.044).", "Elevated long-term air pollution levels in residential areas in Germany, notably of benzene, O<sub>3</sub>, NO, SO<sub>2,</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, were associated with increased stroke mortality of patients.", "Evidence before this study: Besides typical, established risk factors, increasing evidence suggests that air pollution is an important and growing risk factor for stroke events, estimated to be responsible for approximately 14\u00a0% of all stroke-associated deaths. However, real-world data regarding the impact of long-term exposure to air pollution on stroke mortality are sparse. Added value of this study: The present study demonstrates that the long-term exposure to the air pollutants benzene, O<sub>3</sub>, NO, SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are independently associated with increased case-fatality of hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke in Germany. Implications of all the available evidence: The results of our study support the urgent need to reduce the exposure to air pollution by tightening emission controls to reduce the stroke burden and stroke mortality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
