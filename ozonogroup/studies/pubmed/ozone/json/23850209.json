Unaltered Aldrich humic acid (AHA) and standard Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) strongly increased copper release from the model phases but NOM alteration by chlorination or ozonation gradually suppressed or, at higher oxidant doses, eliminated these effects. The nature of NOM changes induced by chlorination and ozonation was examined using differential absorbance spectroscopy (DAS) and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The data of these methods show that NOM molecules with higher apparent molecular weight (AMW), higher aromaticities and contributions of protonation-active phenolic and carboxylic groups play a key role in adsorption and colloidal dispersion of the model solids. The data also show that metal release from model phases was well correlated with a number of spectroscopic parameters characterizing NOM properties, notably SUVA254, spectral slopes of NOM absorbance, and differential absorbance at wavelength of 280 nm and 350 nm that is indicative of the contributions of carboxylic and phenolic functional groups. Changes of \u03b6-potential of the model solid phases were the strongest predictor of the enhancement of copper release especially in the system controlled by malachite. While effects of NOM on the \u03b6-potential of tenorite and malachite were prominent for unaltered NOM, its oxidation by chlorine and ozone was accompanied by a gradual decrease and ultimately disappearance of its surface activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Box 352700, Seattle, WA 98195-2700, USA. gaoyuan@uw.edu"}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Korshin", "ForeName": "Gregory", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organometallic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1319-53-5", "NameOfSubstance": "malachite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XII14C5FXV", "NameOfSubstance": "fulvic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organometallic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23850209", "10.1016/j.watres.2013.04.055", "S0043-1354(13)00404-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
