MTBE readily dissolves in water and has entered the environment via gasoline spills and leaking storage tanks. In this paper, we investigate ozonation and UV-ozonation for treatment of MTBE in contaminated drinking water sources. We report the test protocol and results of using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) to determine the level of MTBE and its oxidation byproducts in samples drawn from laboratory-scale ozone and UV-ozone reactors being evaluated at a US EPA research facility. Analysis of a prepared MTBE standard indicated a detection limit on the order of 0.1 microgl(-1) with a repeatability of +/-0.4%. Results show that the overall rate of removal of MTBE via UV-ozonation in a relatively turbid surface water (15 ntu) is twice that of ozonation alone. In addition, GC-MS analysis of decomposition products showed that tert-butyl formate (TBF), methyl acetate, butene, acetone, and acetaldehyde were produced by both processes. TBF and butene reach similar maximum yields from the two processes, but are more efficiently degraded by UV-ozonation treatment. This indicates that these treatment processes also degrade these byproducts. In contrast, the remaining byproducts (methyl acetate, acetone, and acetaldehyde) are formed at similar levels during treatment, but are not degraded once formed. These byproducts may be resistant to hydrogen abstraction by hydroxyl radical."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Dayton Research Institute, 300 College Park, Dayton, OH 45469-0132, USA. grahamjl@udri.udayton.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Striebich", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patterson", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radha Krishnan", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haught", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29I4YB3S89", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl tert-butyl ether"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ohio"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14637359", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2003.09.017", "S0045-6535(03)00930-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
