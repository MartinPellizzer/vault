To conduct meaningful research into the role of NO., it is necessary to accurately determine its concentration. Its direct and quantitative measurement, however, has been little discussed inspite of the abundance of studies on this compound. Generally most authors refer to indirect qualitative measurements, such as employment of NO-synthase inhibitors, measurement of cGMP or citrulline, and the detection of NO.-induced physiological effects such as vascular relaxation. The primary difficulties in the direct measurement of NO stem from its short lifetime and very low concentrations. Notwithstanding these problems, several quantitative methods for measuring NO. have been established. The most commonly used techniques are as follows: 1) UV-visible spectrophotometry of the diazotization product of the nitrite, NO-hemoglobin or methemoglobin, 2) fluorometry of the fluorescent product of the nitrite, 3) detection of chemiluminescence by its reaction with ozone or luminol/H2O2, 4) amperometric microelectrode assay, and 5) electron spin resonance spectrometry. All the aforementioned techniques have certain limitations that should be considered carefully prior to each application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Research Laboratories, Ciba-Geigy, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microelectrodes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}], "NumberOfReferences": "41"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8690300", "10.1254/fpj.107.173"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
