Knowledge on O<sub>3</sub> impacts on tropical ecosystems is still very limited. An O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment to crops, forests, and people from 25 monitoring stations across the tropical and subtropical Thailand during 2005-2018 showed that 44% of sites exceeded the critical levels (CLs) of SOMO35 (i.e., the annual Sum Of daily maximum 8-h Means Over 35\u00a0ppb) for human health protection. The concentration-based AOT40 CL (i.e., sum of the hourly exceedances above 40\u00a0ppb for daylight hours during the assumed growing season) was exceeded at 52% and 48% of the sites where the main crops rice and maize are present, respectively, and at 88% and 12% of the sites where evergreen or deciduous forests are present, respectively. The flux-based metric PODY (i.e., Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a threshold Y of uptake) was calculated and was found to exceed the CLs at 1.0%, 1.5%, 20.0%, 1.5%, 0% and 68.0% of the sites where early rice, late rice, early maize, late maize, evergreen forests, and deciduous forests can grow, respectively. Trend analysis indicated that AOT40 increased over the study period (+5.9% year<sup>-1</sup>), while POD1 decreased (- 5.3% year<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting that the role of climate change in affecting the environmental factors that control stomatal uptake cannot be neglected. These results contribute novel knowledge on O<sub>3</sub> threat to human health, forest productivity, and food security in tropical and subtropical areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
