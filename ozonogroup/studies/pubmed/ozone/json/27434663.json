Inflammation may be due to mucosal damage, upper (sensory) and lower (pulmonary) airway irritation due to activation of the trigeminal and vagal nerves, respectively, and to neurogenic inflammation. The terpene, d-limonene, is used as a fragrance in numerous consumer products. When limonene reacts with the pulmonary irritant ozone, a complex mixture of gas and particle phase products is formed, which causes sensory irritation. This study investigated whether limonene, ozone or the reaction mixture can exacerbate allergic lung inflammation and whether airway irritation is enhanced in allergic BALB/cJ mice. Na\u00efve and allergic (ovalbumin sensitized) mice were exposed via inhalation for three consecutive days to clean air, ozone, limonene or an ozone-limonene reaction mixture. Sensory and pulmonary irritation was investigated in addition to ovalbumin-specific antibodies, inflammatory cells, total protein and surfactant protein D in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and hemeoxygenase-1 and cytokines in lung tissue. Overall, airway allergy was not exacerbated by any of the exposures. In contrast, it was found that limonene and the ozone-limonene reaction mixture reduced allergic inflammation possibly due to antioxidant properties. Ozone induced sensory irritation in both na\u00efve and allergic mice. However, allergic but not na\u00efve mice were protected from pulmonary irritation induced by ozone. This study showed that irritation responses might be modulated by airway allergy. However, aggravation of allergic symptoms was observed by neither exposure to ozone nor exposure to ozone-initiated limonene reaction products. In contrast, anti-inflammatory properties of the tested limonene-containing pollutants might attenuate airway allergy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "Jitka S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "N\u00f8rgaard", "ForeName": "Asger W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Koponen", "ForeName": "Ismo K", "Initials": "IK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "S\u00f8rli", "ForeName": "Jorid B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Paidi", "ForeName": "Maya D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark , Odense , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "S\u00f8ren W K", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Clausen", "ForeName": "Per Axel", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Nielsen", "ForeName": "Gunnar D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Wolkoff", "ForeName": "Peder", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The National Research Centre for the Working Environment , Copenhagen , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Larsen", "ForeName": "S\u00f8ren Thor", "Initials": "ST"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101201960", "ISSNLinking": "1547-691X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Irritants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Irritants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27434663", "10.1080/1547691X.2016.1195462"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
