Therefore, this study was conducted to assess and compare the environmental impacts of three biogas utilization scenarios for energy production. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method\u00a0was used to compare (i) biogas combustion in combined heat and power (CHP) unit, (ii) biogas burning in a steam boiler, and (iii) biogas upgrading using pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit to determine the most sustainable option. The results revealed that the upgrading scenario was the best option, achieving emission savings in 8 out of 10 investigated impact categories. Among them, the emission saving was the highest in the marine aquatic ecotoxicity category (-4276.97\u00a0kg 1,4-DB eq./MJ). The CHP scenario was the second-best option, followed by the boiler scenario (worst option), and both had the most beneficial performance in the ozone depletion potential category with 6.29E-08 and 9.88E-08\u00a0kg CFC-11-eq./MJ, respectively. The environmental burdens of the boiler scenario were the highest in the marine aquatic ecotoxicity category (248.92\u00a0kg 1,4-DB eq./MJ). Although the CHP and boiler scenarios contributed to environmental burdens in all impact categories, they achieved beneficial performances compared to fossil fuel-based systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
