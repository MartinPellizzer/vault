Furthermore, the problems of the water influence mechanism on the NSR process were also discussed. The results show the following: (1) Pd doping effectively improves the removal of CO (80%) and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (71%) in the low-temperature section of the catalyst (150-250 \u00b0C) compared to Ce doping, while Ce doping exhibits excellent low-temperature conversion of NO. (2) The reaction activation energy of the LaKMnPdO<sub>3</sub> catalyst was 9784 kJ/mol, which was significantly lower than that of the LaKMnCeO<sub>3</sub> catalyst. (3) The presence of H<sub>2</sub>O has an important enhancement effect in the storage performance of the LaKMnPdO<sub>3</sub> catalyst for NO<i>x</i> but decreases the catalytic reduction of NO. It provides a solution for the effective treatment of the increasing problems of particulate matter and ozone pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Science, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Science, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Tianshan", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39124862", "10.3390/molecules29153457", "molecules29153457"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
