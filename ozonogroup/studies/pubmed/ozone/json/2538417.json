These cells converted LTB4 to two major metabolites, both of which exhibited maximal absorbance at 230 nm in their UV spectra. These products were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and identified as 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 and 10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4 on the basis of the mass spectra of various derivatives. The position of the double bond of LTB4 which had been reduced was established by cleaving the remaining double bonds of 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 with ozone followed by oxidation or reduction of the resulting ozonide and analysis of the products by mass spectrometry. Experiments with deuterium-labeled substrate indicated that LTB4 could be directly converted to 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 without the prior oxidation of either of its hydroxyl groups, as is required for the formation of dihydro metabolites of prostaglandins. Incubation of porcine leukocytes with 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4 and 10, 11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4 indicated that these two products can be interconverted and are in equilibrium with one another. The dihydro-oxo metabolite can therefore be formed from 10, 11-dihydro-LTB4, although we have not ruled out the possibility that it is also produced via 12-oxo-LTB4, which could be a transitory intermediate. These results indicate that porcine leukocytes contain a novel reductase/dehydrogenase pathway distinct from the pathway responsible for the metabolism of prostaglandins. This pathway is also different from the pathway in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes which converts 6-trans-isomers of LTB4 to dihydro products, since the latter pathway involves 5-oxo intermediates and results in a shift in the positions of the remaining double bonds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine Laboratory, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Powell", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gravelle", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "10028-17-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Tritium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HGW4DR56D", "NameOfSubstance": "Leukotriene B4"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Leukotriene B4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tritium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2538417", "S0021-9258(18)83554-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
