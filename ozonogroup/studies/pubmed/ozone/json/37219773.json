Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the vital precursors of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. A total of 101 VOC species were measured in four seasons at five sites from 2019 to 2021 in Kaifeng. VOC sources and geographic origin of sources were identified by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory transport model. The source-specific OH loss rates (L<sub>OH</sub>) and ozone formation potential (OFP) were calculated to estimate the effects of each VOC source. The average mixing ratios of total VOCs (TVOC) were 43.15 parts per billion (ppb), of which the alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, halocarbons, and oxygenated VOCs respectively accounted for 49%, 12%, 11%, 14%, and 14%. Although the mixing ratios of alkenes were comparatively low, they played a dominant role in the L<sub>OH</sub> and OFP, especially ethene (0.55\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, 7%; 27.11\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 10%) and 1,3-butadiene (0.74\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, 10%; 12.52\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 5%). The vehicle-related source which emitted considerable alkenes ranked as the foremost contributing factor (21%).
