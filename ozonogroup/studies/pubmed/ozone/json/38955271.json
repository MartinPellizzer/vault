Our findings demonstrated that ARF fostered the accumulation of pollutants and moisture, initiating two distinct feedback mechanisms concerning O<sub>3</sub>. The elevation in the NO/NO<sub>2</sub> ratio amplified O<sub>3</sub> consumption. Increased near-surface moisture diminished upper-level cloud formation, thereby enhancing photolysis rates and O<sub>3</sub> photochemical production. The pronounced impact of heightened NO/NO<sub>2</sub> on O<sub>3</sub> led to a decrease of 0.1-2.7\u00a0ppb. When decoupled from ARF, AEP led to a more significant reduction in photolysis rates, resulting in declines in both O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, except for an anomalous increase observed in summer, with O<sub>3</sub> increasing by 1.6\u00a0ppb and PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>. The heterogeneous absorption of hydroxides in spring, autumn, and winter predominantly governed the AHR-induced variation of O<sub>3</sub>, leading to a decrease in O<sub>3</sub> by 0.7-1\u00a0ppb. Conversely, O<sub>3</sub> variations in summer were primarily dictated by O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive chemistry, with heterogeneous absorption of NO<sub>y</sub> catalyzing a decrease of 2.4\u00a0ppb in O<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, AHR accentuated PM<sub>2.5</sub> by facilitating the formation of fine sulfates and ammonium while impeding nitrate formation. In summer, the collective impact of ARF, AEP, and AHR (ALL) led to a substantial reduction of 6.2\u00a0ppb in O<sub>3</sub>, alleviating the secondary oxidation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and leading to a decrease of 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> in PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Conversely, albeit aerosol substantially depleted O<sub>3</sub> by 0.4-4\u00a0ppb through their interactions except for summer, aerosol feedback on PM<sub>2.5</sub> was more pronounced, resulting in a significant increase of 1.7-6.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> in PM<sub>2.5</sub>.
