Age-period-cohort model and Joinpoint analysis were used to evaluate birth cohort effects specific-disease death burden owing to high-risk air pollution subcategories.", "The number of deaths caused by air pollution increased by 2.62 %, which was driven by ambient particulate matter pollution and ambient ozone pollution, whereas household air pollution decreased. Population ageing contributed 28.88 % of the deaths increase change for air pollution. Compared with other subcategories, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) attributed to ambient particulate matter pollution remained the heaviest attributed death burden, comprehensively considering of bivariate burden. In 2019, ischemic heart disease attributed to ambient particulate matter pollution exhibited the highest ASMR, which may be impacted by a rapid increase era from 1950 to 1980 birth cohort in woman and 1970 to 1990 birth cohort in man. Diabetes mellitus attributed to ambient particulate matter pollution showed the largest increase for ASMR, which was driven primarily by men born 1910-1975 and women born 1950-1975.Uzbekistan showed the highest ASMR for ischemic heart disease, with Equatorial Guinea showing the fastest increase for diabetes mellitus.", "Priority intervention targets for air pollution and health should emphasize the susceptibility of the elderly population as well as the structural factors of the era, in particular sensitive diseases to the ambient particulate matter pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
