In this study, metabolic rates were measured in intact perfused lungs with altered pathology brought about by 3 days continuous exposure to 0.6 ppm ozone. Increased metabolism of ozone-exposed lungs was indicated by a twofold enhancement in glucose utilization, associated with a 62% increase in lactate formation and a 166% increase in the rate of 14CO2 production from D-[U-14C]glucose from control values of 5.2 +/- 0.5 mumol lactate and 4.4 +/- 0.6 mumol 14CO2/h per lung (+/- SE, n = 4), respectively. Mitochondrial metabolism was separately assessed by measurements of 14CO2 production from [U-14C]-pyruvate, which was found not to be significantly altered by ozone exposure, although homogenate oxygen uptake in the presence of succinate was significantly enhanced by 57%. These changes in intermediary metabolism could be correlated with increased glucose carbon incorporation into lipid and elevated activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The observed elevated metabolic rates were consistent with the energy and synthetic needs of a lung during repair of ozone-induced damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassett", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bowen-Kelly", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03505", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-33410", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3953786", "10.1152/ajpendo.1986.250.2.E131"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
