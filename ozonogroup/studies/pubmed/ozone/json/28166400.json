Specifically, the system measures the net photochemical oxidant (O<sub>x</sub>: the sum of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)) production rates (P-L(O<sub>x</sub>)). Measuring O<sub>x</sub> avoids issues from perturbations to the photostationary states between nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub>. This system has \"reaction\" and \"reference\" chambers. Ambient air is introduced into both chambers, and O<sub>x</sub> is photochemically produced in the reaction chamber and not generated in the reference chamber. Air from the chambers is alternately introduced into an NO-reaction (NO: nitric oxide) tube to convert O<sub>3</sub> to NO<sub>2</sub>, and then the O<sub>x</sub> concentration is measured as NO<sub>2</sub> using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. P-L(O<sub>x</sub>) was obtained by dividing the difference in O<sub>x</sub> concentrations between air samples from the two chambers by the mean residence time of the air in the reaction chamber. In this study, the P-L(O<sub>x</sub>) measurement system was characterized, and the current detection limit of P-L(O<sub>x</sub>) was determined to be 0.54 ppbv h<sup>-1</sup> with an integration time of 60 s (S/N = 2), assuming an ambient O<sub>x</sub> concentration of 100 ppbv. Field measurements of P-L(O<sub>x</sub>) were conducted using the system at a remote forest location."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University , 1-1 Gakuen-cho, Naka-ku, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4993-8652"], "LastName": "Sadanaga", "ForeName": "Yasuhiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University , 1-1 Gakuen-cho, Naka-ku, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawasaki", "ForeName": "Shio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University , 1-1 Gakuen-cho, Naka-ku, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Yuki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University , Yoshida-Nihonmatsu-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Kyoto 606-8316, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Environmental Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kajii", "ForeName": "Yoshizumi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University , 1-1 Gakuen-cho, Naka-ku, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bandow", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28166400", "10.1021/acs.est.6b04639"]}}]}
