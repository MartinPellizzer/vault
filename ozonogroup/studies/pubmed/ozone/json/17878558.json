Containers for sample collection were inoculated with 1,000 oocysts l(-1) and filled with ozonated water. Ozone residual concentrations were measured at 0, 5 and 10 min intervals. Viability was determined by excystation. Non-ozonated water from the plant, trip and laboratory controls were also analysed. The applied ozone dose of 2.5 mg l(-1) produced an immediate residual concentration of 1.25 mg 1(-1) at 24 degrees C and 1.34 mg 1(-1) at 18.9 degrees C in unseeded samples. The initial ozone residual in seeded containers was 1.22+/-0.03 mg 1(-1) at 24 degrees C and 1.37+/-0.04 mg 1(-1) at 18.9 degrees C. There was a gradual increase in inactivation of oocysts, with 49% of oocysts inactivated at 0 min to 92% after 10 min at 24 degrees C and 57% at 0 min to 92.8% at 10 min at 18.9 degrees C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health Microbiology, Queensland Health Scientific Services, Archerfield, Queensland, Australia. tracey_wohlsen@health.qld.gov.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wohlsen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stewart", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aldridge", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bates", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Katouli", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Water Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101185420", "ISSNLinking": "1477-8920"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium parvum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oocysts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17878558", "10.2166/wh.2007.039"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
