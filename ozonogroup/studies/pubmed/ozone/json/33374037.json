Correlation analysis was conducted between the amount of locally generated ozone and the daily maximum 8 h average ozone in each city to determine the main source of ozone pollution by determination coefficient (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>). The results show that 121 cities (35.8%) in China exceeded the standard in O<sub>3</sub> concentration in 2018. The local generation of O<sub>3</sub> in 104 cities has a great impact on the local O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and is its main cause. In the other 234 cities, the main source of O<sub>3</sub> pollution is regionally transported O<sub>3</sub>. Cities are classified into four categories based on their ozone concentration levels and pollution sources:cities with a nonattainment ozone situation and mainly locally generated ozone (N-L), cities with a nonattainment ozone situation and mainly regionally transported ozone (N-T), cities with a standard ozone situation and mainly locally generated ozone (S-L), and cities with a standard ozone situation and mainly regionally transported ozone (S-T). Finally, according to the proportion of four city types in each province, the whole country is divided into three types of control areas:severe, moderate, and general. N-L cities in the severe control area account for the largest proportion (20.3%) of the three types of control areas and the pollution is the highest; the proportion of the four categories of cities in the moderate control area are all medium; the general control area mainly includes S-T cities (65.4%), and the pollution is the lowest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Mo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yin-Song", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Centre, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Centre, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control Technology and Equipment, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Li-Ya", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control Technology and Equipment, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Centre for Environmental Risk Prevention and Emergency Disposal, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Dai-Qi", "Initials": "DQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33374037", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202005094"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
