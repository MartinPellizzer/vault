Semibatch ozonation experiments are performed under various reaction conditions to examine the effects of inlet gas ozone concentration, high silica zeolite dosage, and UV radiation intensity on the decomposition of DMP. The complete removal of DMP can be efficiently achieved via both O(3) and O(3)/UV treatments. Note that the presence of high silica zeolites accelerates the decomposition rate of DMP in the O(3) process. On the other hand, the removal efficiencies of both chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbons (TOC) are significantly enhanced by employing the ozonation combined with UV radiation. The O(3)/UV process is also advantageous for the utilization efficiency of fed ozone especially in the late ozonation period. Furthermore, the correlation between the COD removal percentage (%) and the mole ratio of ozone consumed to the DMP treated (mol mol(-1)) is obtained. The clear-cut removal relationship of the TOC with COD during the ozonation of DMP has also been presented. Consequently, the results evaluate the flexibility of ozonation system associated with high silica zeolites and UV radiation for the removal of DMP and provide the useful information in engineering application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Material Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. yhchen@cc.kuas.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi-Hung", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Neng-Chou", "Initials": "NC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsieh", "ForeName": "Da-Cheng", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "08X7F5UDJM", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethyl phthalate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18280038", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.12.091", "S0304-3894(08)00020-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
