The chemically welded network of AgNWs on substrates has been patterned by modified microcontact printing (\u03bcCP). As an ink for the \u03bcCP, uncured high-viscosity siloxane polymer has been applied. Using elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp that has been replicated from micromachined Si master mold by metal-assisted chemical etching, the printed siloxane ink materials have been cured by simple UV/ozone exposure for 3 min, which acts as an etch barrier in ensuing wet-removal of exposed AgNWs network. The proposed patterning technique has no limitation in the choice of substrates and pattern shape, in addition to high resolution. The patterned AgNWs network electrodes have shown excellent optical, electrical, and mechanical performances, such as high flexibility (up to \u223c10%) and stretchability (up to 40%). Finally, the patterned AgNWs network electrodes have been applied as a transparent heater, which can be used for rapid raindrop removal or deicing of car windows and outside mirrors. This can be a valuable help for driving safety under harsh weather conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University , Seoul 03722, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Sung-Soo", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University , Seoul 03722, Korea."}], "LastName": "Khang", "ForeName": "Dahl-Young", "Initials": "DY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27548278", "10.1021/acsami.6b05909"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
