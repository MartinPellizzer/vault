Ozonation, an alternative decontamination method, can be applied effectively to perishable commodities immediately after harvest. Kiwifruit is a subtropical climacteric fruit that is less able to acclimate and is susceptible to low temperatures. In this study, we investigated the influence of ozone and different storage temperatures on the physico-chemical and qualitative features in Actinidia chinensis 'Soreli'. The fruits were treated with a continuous flow of ozone in air (300\u2009ppb), stored at 2 and 4 \u00b0C for 60\u2009days, and sampled every 15\u2009days.", "It was found that ozone treatment induced the ripening process; this was evident at the end of the storage, with higher soluble solids content for ozone-treated fruits at 2 and 4 \u00b0C. Storage temperatures and gaseous ozone treatment influenced in a different manner the bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and carotenoids. Additionally, under gaseous ozone storage, microbial growth was delayed, improving the microbial quality index when the fruits were stored at the lowest storage temperature (2 \u00b0C). Principal component analysis highlighted that the effects of storage temperature on physico-chemical and bioactive compounds were greater than the postharvest treatment.", "Storage temperature influenced the postharvest life of 'Soreli'. Storage at 2 \u00b0C and under 300\u2009ppb gaseous ozone improved the yellow-fleshed fruit storage life. However, storage at 4 \u00b0C under 300\u2009ppb gaseous ozone did not show advantages in preserving the fruit quality. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goffi", "ForeName": "Valentina", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e l'Analisi dell'Economia agraria (CREA), Centro di ricerca per Olivicoltura, Frutticoltura e Agrumicoltura, Caserta, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zampella", "ForeName": "Luigi", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forniti", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e l'Analisi dell'Economia agraria (CREA), Centro di ricerca per Olivicoltura, Frutticoltura e Agrumicoltura, Caserta, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5284-0333"], "LastName": "Petriccione", "ForeName": "Milena", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1866-8741"], "LastName": "Botondi", "ForeName": "Rinaldo", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Actinidia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Storage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Richardson DP, Ansell J and Drummond LN, The nutritional and health attributes of kiwifruit: a review.
