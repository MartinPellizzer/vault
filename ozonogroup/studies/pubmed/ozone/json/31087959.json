The satellite and surface observations agree well, revealing that the highest concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> are distributed in East China, and with a seasonal pattern of high in summer and low in winter. Records of the diurnal variation of O<sub>3</sub> over the four cities of interest (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu) reveal that O<sub>3</sub> peaked at 15:00-16:00 each day. Statistical analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in O<sub>3</sub> concentration between weekends and weekdays for the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. Surface O<sub>3</sub> over China increased dramatically from April 2013 to June 2018. The increase of the surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration from 2014 to 2017 is significant for Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu, and the rates of increase were 2.36, 3.3, and 3.6 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Analysis based on the daily max 8 h rolling mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration reveals that the percentage of days with O<sub>3</sub> concentration exceeding the national standard (160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) in 2014-2017 were 17.2% for Beijing, 10.7% for Shanghai, 8.8% for Guangzhou, and 11.2% for Chengdu. O<sub>3</sub> pollution is most severe in Beijing where the highest O<sub>3</sub> concentration occurs, along with the largest number of days with daily max 8 h rolling O<sub>3</sub> concentration exceeding 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Satellite Meteorological Center, Beijing 100081, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Satellite Meteorological Center, Beijing 100081, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xing-Ying", "Initials": "XY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087959", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201808028"]}}]}
