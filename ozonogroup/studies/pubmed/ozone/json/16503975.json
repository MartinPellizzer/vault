The purpose of this study was to examine the association between LBW among term infants and ambient air pollution, by trimester of exposure, in a region of lower level exposures.", "The relationship between LBW and ambient levels of particulate matter up to 10 um in diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) was evaluated using the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database and ambient air monitoring data from the Environment Canada National Air Pollution Surveillance Network and the Nova Scotia Department of Environment. The cohort consisted of live singleton births (> or =37 weeks of gestation) between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 2000. Maternal exposures to air pollution were assigned to women living within 25 km of a monitoring station at the time of birth. Air pollution was evaluated as a continuous and categorical variable (using quartile exposures) for each trimester and relative risks were estimated from logistic regression, adjusted for confounding variables.", "There were 74,284 women with a term, singleton birth during the study period and with exposure data. In the analyses unadjusted for year of birth, first trimester exposures in the highest quartile for SO2 and PM10 suggested an increased risk of delivering a LBW infant (relative risk = 1.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.04 to 1.78 for SO2 exposure and relative risk = 1.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.02 to 1.74 for PM10). After adjustment for birth year, the relative risks were attenuated somewhat and not statistically significant. A dose-response relationship for SO2 was noted with increasing levels of exposure. No statistically significant effects were noted for ozone.", "Our results suggest that exposure during the first trimester to relatively low levels of some air pollutants may be associated with a reduction in birth weight in term-born infants. These findings have implications for the development of effective risk management strategies to minimize the public health impacts for pregnant women."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Health Effects Division, Health Canada, Postal Locator 4602C, Ottawa Ontario, K1A 0K9, Canada. rose.dugandzic@hc-sc.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dugandzic", "ForeName": "Rose", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dodds", "ForeName": "Linda", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stieb", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith-Doiron", "ForeName": "Marc", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101147645", "ISSNLinking": "1476-069X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Low Birth Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nova Scotia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Trimester, First"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Lee BE, Ha EH, Park HS, Kim YJ, Hong YC, Kim H, Lee JT.
