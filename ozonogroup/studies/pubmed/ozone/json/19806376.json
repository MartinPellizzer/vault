Eight high O(3) episode days were identified at WQS and two at TC during the sampling campaign, indicating a more serious O(3) pollution in Guangzhou than in Hong Kong. An observation-based model was employed to determine the ozone-precursor relationship. At both sites, O(3) production was found to be volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited, which is consistent with previous observations. Anthropogenic hydrocarbons played a key role in O(3) production, while reducing nitric oxide emissions aided the buildup of O(3) concentrations. Among VOC species, the summed relative incremental reactivity (RIR) of the top 12 compounds accounted for 89% and 85% of the total RIR at WQS and TC, respectively, indicating that local photochemical O(3) formation can be mainly attributed to a small number of VOC species.", "A large increment in both simulated HO(2) and O(3) concentrations was achieved with additional input of hourly carbonyl data. This suggested that apart from hydrocarbons, carbonyls might significantly contribute to the O(3) production in the Pearl River Delta."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Hairong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xinming", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saunders", "ForeName": "Sam M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "S H M", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tijian", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Aijun", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Shuncheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2010 Sep;17(8):1491-2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2004 Jul 26;328(1-3):161-74", "ArticleIdList": ["15207581"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 1995 Mar;45(3):161-80", "ArticleIdList": ["15658156"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2006 Apr 1;40(7):2099-107", "ArticleIdList": ["16646439"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1995 Aug 18;269(5226):953-6", "ArticleIdList": ["17807730"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19806376", "10.1007/s11356-009-0247-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
