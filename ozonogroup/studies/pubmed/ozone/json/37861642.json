Resin sealants have been shown to help reduce fissure decay in both primary and permanent teeth. Etching of primary molars is not effective due to prismless enamel, higher organic content, and diversity in fissure shape. Methods of pretreatment of pits and fissures have been hypothesized to promote microporosities in etched enamel and hence sealant adherence. Examining the etching pattern and surface roughness of the enamel surface can be used to gauge these.", "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with ozone gas and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution on pits and fissures of primary teeth to check for the etching pattern and surface roughness.", "Thirty noncarious primary molars were sectioned to retain the crowns, and randomly divided into three groups, sodium hypochlorite, ozone gas, and control. Each sample was pretreated with the agent, washed, followed by etching with 37% phosphoric acid. Samples were sectioned and subjected to scanning electron microscope analysis to evaluate the etching pattern and surface roughness.", "Comparison of the etching pattern in three groups showed a statistically insignificant difference (P=0.364). Surface roughness was highest in the hypochlorite group followed by ozone and control which showed a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001). The surface area between the three groups showed a statistically insignificant difference.", "Sodium hypochlorite is a better pretreatment agent compared to ozone gas and acid etching alone. However, as all results were not statistically significant further research must be carried out to prove the effectiveness of these agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth Dental College and Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Gandhi", "ForeName": "Mehek", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth Dental College and Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Lakade", "ForeName": "Laxmi", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth Dental College and Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Davalbhakta", "ForeName": "Rucha", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth Dental College and Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Alok", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth Dental College and Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Chaudhary", "ForeName": "Shweta", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth Dental College and Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Jajoo", "ForeName": "Shweta", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Indian Soc Pedod Prev Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8710631", "ISSNLinking": "0970-4388"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pit and Fissure Sealants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoric Acids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Etching, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pit and Fissure Sealants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tooth, Deciduous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37861642", "10.4103/jisppd.jisppd_352_23", "JIndianSocPedodPrevDent_2023_41_3_258_388246"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
