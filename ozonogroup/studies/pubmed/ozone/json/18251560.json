By using a cold solution of ozone in methanol and then adding a reducing agent to this solution, acid formation is minimized and near-quantitative aldehyde formation is achieved. The aldehyde-bearing surface is characterized by its physical and chemical properties and by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy showing a characteristic aldehyde C-H peak at 2715 cm(-1) and carbonyl peak at 1729 cm(-1). The reactivity of the aldehyde-bearing surface is shown by its reaction with amines and amine derivatives to give surface-bound imines and by the reversible cycling between aldehyde and acetal. The acetal also provides a useful way to mask the aldehyde and store readily released aldehyde surface functionality for subsequent surface elaboration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Center for Nanomaterials of the Institute for Nanotechnology, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Razgon", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bergman", "ForeName": "Robert G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sukenik", "ForeName": "Chaim N", "Initials": "CN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z4152N8IUI", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18251560", "10.1021/la703120c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
