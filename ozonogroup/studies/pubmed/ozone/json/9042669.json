It is currently widely believed that such pulmonary damage results, at least in part, from the reaction of ozone at sites of unsaturation in phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) molecules located in the epithelial fluid layer lining the lung surfaces and/or the plasma membranes of epithelial cells underlying this fluid layer. The objective of this study was to compare the PLFA composition of lung tissue and surfactant from ozone-sensitive late stage pregnant and lactating rats with comparable tissue from relatively ozone-insensitive age-matched prepregnant (virgin female) rats to explore the possibility that changes in lung PLFA composition during pregnancy and/or lactation contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of these physiologic states to ozone. In addition, the correlation of changes in plasma PLFA composition with those in lung was investigated. There were minor differences in the composition of lung tissue and surfactant PLFAs between prepregnant rats and pregnant rats at day 17 of gestation and only slightly greater differences between prepregnant and lactating rats. Changes from the prepregnant state in the PLFA composition of lung tissue, but not surfactant, correlated with changes in the plasma only in lactating rats and not in pregnant rats. Overall, the double bond index of PLFAs in surfactant and lung tissue was decreased in pregnant and lactating rats compared with prepregnant rats. Thus, the increased sensitivity of pregnant and lactating rats to ozone-induced lung injury cannot be attributed to an increased availability of unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the arachidonic acid composition of phospholipids did not appear to explain differences between prepregnant rats and pregnant or lactating rats in their inflammatory response to ozone. In conclusion, there is no evidence that the relatively minor changes in lung tissue PLFA composition which occur during pregnancy and lactation predispose rats in these physiologic states to ozone-induced pulmonary toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gunnison", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finkelstein", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES 00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES 05939", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Lung", "NlmUniqueID": "7701875", "ISSNLinking": "0341-2040"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Toxicol Environ Health. 1987;21(1-2):45-56", "ArticleIdList": ["3106644"]}, {"Citation": "J Lipid Res. 1985 Sep;26(9):1015-35", "ArticleIdList": ["3906008"]}, {"Citation": "Free Radic Biol Med. 1994 Nov;17(5):451-65", "ArticleIdList": ["7835752"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1992 Jul;7(1):73-80", "ArticleIdList": ["1320904"]}, {"Citation": "Free Radic Biol Med. 1992;12(1):83-8", "ArticleIdList": ["1537573"]}, {"Citation": "Res Rep Health Eff Inst. 1995 Sep;(71):1-15; discussion 19-26", "ArticleIdList": ["11379054"]}, {"Citation": "Free Radic Biol Med. 1991;11(1):41-6", "ArticleIdList": ["1937128"]}, {"Citation": "Fundam Appl Toxicol. 1992 Nov;19(4):607-12", "ArticleIdList": ["1426719"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Clin Nutr. 1972 Sep;25(9):897-904", "ArticleIdList": ["4626563"]}, {"Citation": "J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo). 1993 Jun;39(3):243-52", "ArticleIdList": ["8229316"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 May 10;319(1):257-66", "ArticleIdList": ["7771793"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Jun 1;88(11):4835-9", "ArticleIdList": ["2052562"]}, {"Citation": "Pediatr Res. 1990 Nov;28(5):485-92", "ArticleIdList": ["2255573"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Phys Lipids. 1974 May;12(3):153-71", "ArticleIdList": ["4858129"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1957 May;226(1):497-509", "ArticleIdList": ["13428781"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1995 Mar;103 Suppl 2:91-5", "ArticleIdList": ["7614953"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Res Toxicol. 1992 Jan-Feb;5(1):134-41", "ArticleIdList": ["1581530"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9042669", "10.1007/pl00007560"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
