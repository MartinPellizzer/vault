The detrimental effect of 8-150 ppbv ozone depends on the chemical structure of the compounds:\u2009 saturated terpenoids such as 1,8-cineole, camphor, and bornyl acetate are unaffected by ozone. The terpenes and terpenoids which containing one C-C double bond are slightly decomposed in the order camphene < \u03b2-pinene \u2248 myrtenal < \u03b1-pinene < sabinene \u2248 citronellal. The compounds containing two or more double bonds are significantly decomposed in the order d-limonene \u2248 citral < linalool < \u03b2-ocimene < terpinolene << \u03b1-terpinene \u2248 \u03b2-caryophyllene. For \u03b1-pinene, sabinene and d-limonene, their ozonolysis products are found on the tubes:\u2009 pinonaldehyde, 5-(1-methylethyl)bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one, and 3-(1-methylethenyl)-6-oxoheptanal. The analytical recoveries are significantly enhanced for many compounds when the sampling duration is reduced from 10 min to 30 s, explained by the time available for ozonolysis. A miniature ozone scrubber with multiple layers of MnO(2)-coated copper nets was developed and thoroughly tested. The optimal number of plies is found to be 8, which ensures quantitative recoveries for all test compounds except \u03b1-terpinene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, citral, and citronellal. The results that are reported here call into question previous data on terpenes and terpenoids and/or their oxidation products where measurements have been carried out without the prior removal of ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "European Commission Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Environment Institute, TP 290, I-21020 Ispra (VA), Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calogirou", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larsen", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brussol", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duane", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kotzias", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21619114", "10.1021/ac950803i"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
