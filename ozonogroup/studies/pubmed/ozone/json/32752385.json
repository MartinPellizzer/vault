A germanium-on-insulator (GOI) platform with a 200-mm wafer scale was realized for photodetector fabrication via direct wafer bonding and layer transfer techniques, followed by oxygen annealing in finance. A thin germanium-oxide (GeO<sub>x</sub>) layer was formed on the sidewall of photodetectors by ozone oxidation to suppress surface leakage current. The responsivity of the vertical p-i-n annealed GOI photodetectors was revealed to be 0.42 and 0.28 A/W at 1,500 and 1,550 nm at -1 V, respectively. The photodetector characteristics are investigated in comparison with photodetectors with SiO<sub>2</sub> surface passivation. The surface leakage current is reduced by a factor of 10 for photodetectors via ozone oxidation. The 3dB bandwidth of 1.72 GHz at -1 V for GeO<sub>x</sub> surface-passivated photodetectors is enhanced by approximately 2 times compared to the one for SiO<sub>2</sub> surface-passivated photodetectors. The 3dB bandwidth is theoretically expected to further enhance to \u223c70 GHz with a 5 \u00b5m mesa diameter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Bongkwon", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yiding", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kwang Hong", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shaoteng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Chuan Seng", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Express", "NlmUniqueID": "101137103", "ISSNLinking": "1094-4087"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32752385", "10.1364/OE.398199", "433949"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
