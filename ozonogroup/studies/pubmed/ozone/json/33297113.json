Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), sodium persulfate (SPS) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were the oxidants studied and carbon nanotubes (CNT) and nanosized zero valent iron (nZVI) were used as the nanomaterials. The impact of these oxidants and nanomaterials was evaluated at various dosages in both Milli-Q water and groundwater. The results indicate that with a suitable dose of oxidants or nanomaterials, photocatalytic degradation of sulfolane in Milli-Q water can be enhanced. The addition of ozone contributed to a significant increase in sulfolane degradation rate in Milli-Q water. The experiments conducted in groundwater showed that oxidants (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, SPS and O<sub>3</sub>) increased the degradation of sulfolane while the nanomaterials (CNT and nZVI) impeded sulfolane degradation in groundwater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
