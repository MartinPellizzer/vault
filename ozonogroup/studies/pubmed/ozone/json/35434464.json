It is unknown whether evidence of metabolic disruption associated with air pollution is identifiable at birth. We examined exposure to prenatal ambient air pollution and cord blood cardiometabolic biomarkers among 812 mother-infant pairs in the Healthy Start study.", "Using inverse-distance-weighted interpolation of ambient concentrations obtained from stationary monitors, we estimated daily particulate matter \u22642.5 micrometers (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations at participant residences. Daily estimates were averaged by trimester, full-pregnancy, and the 7 and 30 days prior to delivery. Associations of air pollution with the following cord blood biomarkers were estimated via multivariable linear regression: glucose, insulin, glucose/insulin ratio (GIR), leptin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, free fatty acids, and triglycerides.", "In this Denver-based cohort, PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were lower than in many US urban areas, but O<sub>3</sub> concentrations regularly exceeded federal air quality standards. Higher O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during pregnancy were consistently associated with higher insulin and lower GIR in cord blood. For example, an interquartile range increase in full pregnancy O<sub>3</sub> (6.3 parts per billion [ppb]) was associated with 0.13 log-\u00b5IU/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04, 0.22) higher cord blood insulin, after adjusting for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and other confounders. We found positive, but generally nonsignificant, associations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and leptin and isolated associations between pollutants during certain exposure periods and lipids.", "In this cohort with moderately high O<sub>3</sub> exposure, prenatal concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> were positively associated with cord blood insulin. Future studies should examine the implications for offspring long-term health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
