To further improve MBR performance, the optimal operation conditions including hydraulic retention time (HRT) and initial ammonia nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N) need to be explored. In this study, the role of ozone pretreatment on MBR optimization was investigated. Compared with MBR treating raw OSPW, MBR treating ozonated OSPW had the same optimal operation conditions (HRT of 12\u202fh and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N concentration of 25\u202fmg/L). Nevertheless, MBR performance benefited from HRT adjustment more after ozone pretreatment. HRT adjustment resulted in NA removal in the range of 33-50% for the treatment of ozonated OSPW whereas NA removal for raw OSPW only fluctuated between 27% and 38%. Compared with the removal of classical NAs, the degradation of oxidized NAs was more sensitive to the adjustment of operation conditions. Adjusting HRT increased the removal of oxidized NAs in ozonated OSPW substantially (from 6% to 35%). It was also noticed that microbial communities in MBR treating ozonated OSPW were more responsive to the adjustment of operation conditions as indicated by the noticeable increase of Shannon index and extended genetic distances."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
