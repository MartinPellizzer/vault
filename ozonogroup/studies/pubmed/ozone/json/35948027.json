However, its abundance and sources outside the polar regions are not well-known. Here, we report significant levels of molecular bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>)\u2500a producer of Br<sup>\u2022</sup>\u2500observed at a coastal site in Hong Kong, with an average noontime mixing ratio of 5 ppt. Given the short lifetime of Br<sub>2</sub> (\u223c1 min at noon), this finding reveals a large Br<sub>2</sub> daytime source. On the basis of laboratory and field evidence, we show that the observed daytime Br<sub>2</sub> is generated by the photodissociation of particulate nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and that the reactive uptake of dinitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) on aerosols is an important nighttime source. Model-calculated Br<sup>\u2022</sup> concentrations are comparable with that of the OH radical\u2500the primary oxidant in the troposphere, accounting for 24% of the oxidation of isoprene, a 13% increase in net O<sub>3</sub> production, and a nearly 10-fold increase in the production rate of toxic Hg<sup>II</sup>. Our findings reveal that reactive bromines play a larger role in the atmospheric chemistry and air quality of polluted coastal and maritime areas than previously thought. Our results also suggest that tightening the control of emissions of two conventional pollutants (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>)\u2500thereby decreasing the levels of nitrate and aerosol acidity\u2500would alleviate halogen radical production and its adverse impact on air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department
