CASTNet evolved from the National Dry Deposition Network (NDDN). CASTNet currently consists of 45 sites in the eastern United States and 28 sites in the West. Each site measures sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), particle sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup>), particle nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ), and ozone. Nineteen sites collect precipitation samples. NDDN/CASTNet uses a uniform set of site-selection criteria which provides the data user with consistent measures to compare each site. These criteria also ensure that, to the extent possible, CASTNet sites are located away from local emission sources. This paper presents an analysis of SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup> concentration data collected from 1987 through 1996 at rural NDDN/CASTNet sites. Annual and seasonal variability is examined. Gradients of SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup> are discussed. The variability of the atmospheric mix of SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup> is explored spatially and seasonally. Data from CASTNet are also compared to SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup> data from concurrent monitoring studies in rural areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Exposure Research Laboratory , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baumgardner", "ForeName": "Ralph E", "Initials": "RE", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b QST Environmental Inc , Gainesville , Florida , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isil", "ForeName": "Selma S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Thermo Environmental Instruments , Morrisville , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bowser", "ForeName": "Jon J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Research Triangle Institute , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fitzgerald", "ForeName": "Kelley M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28072371", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463966"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
