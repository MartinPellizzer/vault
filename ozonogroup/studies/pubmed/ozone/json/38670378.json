The efficient treatment of olive mill wastewater (OMW) is of high relevance, particularly for these countries. Climate changes are leading to increasing periods of droughts, and water recovery from polluted streams is essential to ensure the sustainability of this scarce resource. A combination of various technologies involving physical, chemical, and biological processes has been developed for OMW treatment. However, the treatments studied have limitations such as the operation costs, difficulty of industrial scale-up, and the fact that the vast majority do not lead to suitable treated water for discharge/reuse. As such, it is urgent to develop a solution capable of efficiently treating this effluent, overcoming the disadvantages of existing processes to convert OMW from a serious environmental problem into a valuable source of water and nutrients. In this review, several studies based on the OMW treatment are critically discussed, from conventional approaches such as the physical (e.g. centrifugation, filtration, and adsorption) and biological (anaerobic digestion and anaerobic co-digestion) processes, to the most recent technologies such as advanced membrane filtration, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and sulfate radical based AOPs (SR-AOPs). Due to the complexity of the effluent, OMW cannot be efficiently treated by a single process, requiring a sequence of technologies before reaching the required characteristics for discharge into water courses or use in crop irrigation. Reviewing the published results in this matter, it seems that the sequence of processes encompassing ozonation, anaerobic digestion, and SR-AOPs could be the ideal combination for this purpose. However, membrane technologies may be necessary in the final stage of treatment so that the effluent meets legal discharge or irrigation limits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
