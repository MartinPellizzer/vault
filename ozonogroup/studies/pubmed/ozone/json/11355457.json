This chemical mechanism describes the reactions of 3603 chemical species taking part in more than 10,500 chemical reactions. An index value has been calculated for each organic compound, which describes the increment in ozone concentrations found downwind of an urban area following the emission of a fixed increment in the mass emission of each organic compound. These indices, termed photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCPs), have been expressed on a scale relative to ethylene (ethene) = 100, and, a reactivity scale has been generated for alkanes, alkenes, and oxygenated and halogenated organic compounds. A high degree of correlation (R2 = 0.9) was found between these POCP values and the most widely accepted urban reactivity scale. While the reactivities of most of the 86 organic compounds compared fell within a consistent range, significant discrepancies were found for only 5 compounds. Single-day or multiday conditions appear to be important in establishing quantitative reactivity scales for the less reactive organic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Climate Research Division, Meteorological Office, Bracknell, United Kingdom. rgderwent@meto.gov.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derwent", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jenkin", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saunders", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pilling", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Policy Making"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11355457", "10.1080/10473289.2001.10464297"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
