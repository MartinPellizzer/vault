The objective of the current study was to compare the curative outcome of ozone (treatment group) and conventional interventional treatment (comparison group) through comparing the different effects in the infertility cases caused by fallopian tube obstruction, with the purpose to provide future reference for better treatment regimen for tubal obstruction. 400 infertile cases caused by tubal obstruction admitted in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine from August 2006 to January 2012 were enrolled in this study and received either ozone or conventional interventional treatment. No difference was observed between post-operative proximal tube recanalization rates in the two groups; however, post-operative distal tube recanalization rate and recanalization rate after 6 months were significantly higher in the treatment group. Importantly, the adhesion and conception rates were significantly lower and higher, respectively, in the treatment group compared to the comparison group after six months. Hence, ozone therapy can potentially become a viable treatment modality for far-end tubal obstruction patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Interventional Radiography, Second Hospital Affiliated to Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine Xianyang 712000, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Interventional Radiography, Second Hospital Affiliated to Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine Xianyang 712000, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xuanpeng", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Clin Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101471010", "ISSNLinking": "1940-5901"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Fidler A, Bernstein J.
