The study was conducted on 256 ewes from 11 sheep farms in north-western Croatia. A total of 139 ewes were diagnosed with dystocia (DT) and 49 with retention of placenta (RP). Ewes with RP were treated either with ozone foam spray (Riger spray G; Novagen(\u00ae) ) applied into the body of the uterus for 2-3\u00a0s (first or RPO group; n\u00a0=\u00a024) or with two foaming, intrauterine tablets of oxytetracycline hydrochloride (Geomycin(\u00ae) F) (second or RPA group; n\u00a0=\u00a025). The third and fourth groups consisted of ewes that received OA for dystocia (including ringwomb, foetal oversize and assistance of abnormal position and posture). The third group (DTO; n\u00a0=\u00a070) was treated with ozone foam spray, while ewes in fourth group (DTA; n\u00a0=\u00a069) were treated with antibiotics. The ewes in the control group (CTL) with physiological puerperium were randomly selected (n\u00a0=\u00a070) from all herds. Transrectal ultrasonography (transversal diameter of uterine horns) was used for the control of uterus regression on days 2 and 25 after parturition. There was a difference in transversal uterine horn diameter in the RP groups, that is RPO and RPA (5.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53\u00a0cm vs. 5.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0cm), ewes with dystocia, that is DTO and DTA (5.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\u00a0cm vs. 5.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60\u00a0cm) and ewes from the CTL group (4.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35\u00a0cm) one day after parturition. Average transversal uterine diameter of all groups at day 25 post-partum was 1.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0cm. The intrauterine ozone treatment in ewes with RP and after manual obstetrics attained similar results to spontaneously delivered ewes (CTL group), showed as the physiological regression of the uterus with a similar transversal diameter without the presence of lochia in the uterine lumen, indicating that this could be a novel potential alternative therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Practice d.o.o. \u0110ur\u0111evac, \u0110ur\u0111evac, Croatia."}], "LastName": "\u0110uri\u010di\u0107", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia."}], "LastName": "Valpoti\u0107", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia."}], "LastName": "\u017dura \u017daja", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia."}], "LastName": "Samard\u017eija", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Reprod Domest Anim", "NlmUniqueID": "9015668", "ISSNLinking": "0936-6768"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X20I9EN955", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytetracycline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Dystocia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxytetracycline"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Placenta, Retained"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27287827", "10.1111/rda.12715"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
