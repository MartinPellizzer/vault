Many conservative treatment methods for neck pain have been described. The purpose of this study was to obtain pain scores for patients undergoing paravertebral ozone-oxygen (O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) injections for neck pain caused by cervical disc disease. Over the last 6 months of 2018, 72 patients who undergoing intramuscular O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> injections to treat neck pain were examined retrospectively in this multicenter study. Patients were injected with 30 mL of 20 \u03bcg/mL O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> gas (into the paravertebral space). Subjects were treated once a week for 6 weeks. The visual analog scale pain scores and Japanese Orthopedic Association scores were obtained before (pre-injection) and after treatment (i.e., at 2 and 6 months). Significant improvements were observed in visual analog scale and Japanese Orthopedic Association scores at both 2 and 6 months versus the pre-injection scores. There was no significant difference in the visual analog scale or Japanese Orthopedic Association scores between 2 and 6 months. Paravertebral O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> injection is a reliable and effective treatment of neck pain caused by cervical disc disease. The study was approved by Umraniye Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Turkey (Reference Number: 00102187854) on September 25, 2019."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Treatment and Rehabilitation, Beykent University School of Health Sciences and Basari Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ucar", "ForeName": "Demet", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal, Sancaktepe Ilhan Varank Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "U\u00e7ar", "ForeName": "Selcen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Umraniye Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zcan", "ForeName": "\u00c7a\u011fr\u0131", "Initials": "\u00c7"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Umraniye Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Polat", "ForeName": "\u00d6mer", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7a\u00e7an", "ForeName": "Mehmet Akif", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Umraniye Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "U\u00e7ar", "ForeName": "Bekir Yavuz", "Initials": "BY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study", "Multicenter Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Med Gas Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101564536", "ISSNLinking": "2045-9912"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neck Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intramuscular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cervical Vertebrae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Babatunde OO, Jordan JL, Van der Windt DA, Hill JC, Foster NE, Protheroe J.
