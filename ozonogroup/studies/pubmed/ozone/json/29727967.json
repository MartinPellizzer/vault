Another objective was to verify if weather seasons affect the concentration and complexity of PAHs. For these purposes, semipermeable membrane devices were installed in a surface water treatment plant located in Lower Silesia (Poland). Samples were collected monthly over a period of one year. To determine the effect of water treatment on PAH concentrations, four sampling sites were selected: raw water input, a stream of water in the pipe just before ozonation, treated water output and water after passing through the distribution system. After each month of sampling, SPMDs were exchanged for fresh ones and prepared for instrumental analysis. Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The presented study indicates that semipermeable membrane devices can be an effective tool for the analysis of drinking water, in which organic micropollutants occur at very low concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
