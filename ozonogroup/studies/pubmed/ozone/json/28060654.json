The existing policy allows \"negligibly reactive\" organic emissions, that is, emissions with ambient ozone production potential lower than that of ethane, to be exempted from all ozone regulations. It relies on use of k<sub>OH</sub> and incremental reactivity data for determining whether an organic compound is negligibly reactive. Recent scientific evidence suggests that (1) exempting the negligibly reactive organic emissions from all regulations is unjustifiable, (2) the choice of ethane as the benchmark organic species for distinguishing reactive from negligibly reactive organics may be inappropriate, (3) the assumptions and methods used for classifying organic compounds as \"reactive\" and \"negligibly reactive\" should be reconsidered, and (4) the volatility factor should be considered, more appropriately, in much the same way as the reactivity factor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dimitriades", "ForeName": "Basil", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28060654", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463852"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
