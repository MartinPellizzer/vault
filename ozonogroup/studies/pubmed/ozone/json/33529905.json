Observation networks for these pollutants have been expanding in developed regions of China, such as North China Plain (NCP) and Pearl River Delta (PRD), but are sparse in Yangtze River Delta (YRD), meaning their concentration and influencing factors remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a one-year measurement of atmospheric PAN, O<sub>3</sub>, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and meteorological parameters from December 2016 to November 2017 in Shanghai. Overall, high hourly maximum PAN and O<sub>3</sub> were found to be 7.0 and 185\u00a0ppbv in summer, 6.2 and 146\u00a0ppbv in autumn, 5.8 and 137\u00a0ppbv in spring, and 6.0 and 76.7\u00a0ppbv in winter, respectively. Continental air masses probably carried atmospheric pollutants to the sampling site, while frequent maritime winds brought in less polluted air masses. Furthermore, positive correlations (R: 0.72-0.85) between PAN and O<sub>3</sub> were found in summer, indicating a predominant role of photochemistry in their formation. Unlike in summer, weak or no correlations between PAN and O<sub>3</sub> were featured during the other seasons, especially in winter, due to their different loss pathways. Unexpectedly, positive correlations between PAN and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were found in all seasons. During summer, moderate correlation could be attributed to the strong photochemistry acting as a common driver in the formation of secondary aerosols and PAN. During winter, high PM<sub>2.5</sub> might promote PAN production through HONO production, hence resulting in a good positive correlation. Additionally, the loss of PAN by thermal decomposition (TPAN) only accounted for a small fraction (ca. 1%) of the total (PAN\u00a0+\u00a0TPAN) during a typical winter episode, while it significantly reached 14.4\u00a0ppbv (71.1% of the total) in summer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
