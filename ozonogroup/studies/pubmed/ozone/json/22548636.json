But they are not, and both the expert opinions of EPA researchers and analysis of data suggest that a true value of zero for the PM(2.5) mortality causal coefficient is not excluded by available data. Presenting continuous confidence intervals that exclude the discrete possibility of zero misrepresents what is currently known (and not known) about the hypothesized causal relation between changes in PM(2.5) levels and changes in mortality rates, suggesting greater certainty about projected health benefits than is justified."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 Society for Risk Analysis."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "Louis Anthony", "Initials": "LA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter", "Comment"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Risk Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8109978", "ISSNLinking": "0272-4332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Risk Anal. 2012 Jan;32(1):81-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01630.x", "PMID": "21627672"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22548636", "10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01806.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
