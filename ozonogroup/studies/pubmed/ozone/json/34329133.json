Applying a middle wall in the reactor improved coagulation under ozone-induced rapid mixing on the first side and flocculation under flow-induced slow mixing on the other side which reduced the floc breakage at high ozone dosages. Dye, COD, and TOC removal rate was in the following order: EC(Al)-O<sub>3</sub>>EC(Fe)-O<sub>3</sub>>EC(Al)\u2192O<sub>3</sub>>EC(Fe)\u2192O<sub>3</sub>>EC(Al)>EC(Fe)>O<sub>3</sub>. The synergistic effect of simultaneous combined process on dye, COD, and TOC removal were obtained 1.97, 1.42, and 1.69 for EC(Al)-O<sub>3</sub> and 1.37, 1.14, and 1.26 for EC(Fe)-O<sub>3</sub>, respectively, which showed more ozone activation in the presence of Al ions compared to Fe ions. Also, ozone-induced corrosion for Al electrode was less than Fe electrode, which reduced anode consumption and operation cost. Finally, EC(Al)-O<sub>3</sub> due to best performance and EC(Fe)\u2192O<sub>3</sub> due to optimal use of EC for decolorization and O<sub>3</sub> for oxidation, with dye, COD, and TOC removal efficiency, energy and anode consumption, and operation cost equal to 99, 51, and 62%, 18.6\u00a0kWh m<sup>-3</sup>, 0.05\u00a0kg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> and 0.21 $ m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, for EC(Al)-O<sub>3</sub> and 99, 44.5, and 51%, 6.7\u00a0kWh m<sup>-3</sup>, 0.2\u00a0kg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> and 0.14 $ m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, for EC(Fe)\u2192O<sub>3</sub>, are suggested as suitable options for dye wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
