The influencing factors (the catalyst type, the initial concentration, the gas flow, and oxygen content) on the degradation efficiency by the non-thermal plasma synergistic the LaMnO<sub>3</sub> catalysts doped with Zr, Co and Fe were investigated systematically. The degradation mechanism of the meta-xylene degradation by the non-thermal plasma synergistic Mn-Zr-La/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was researched. The results showed that the Mn-Zr-La/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst in the four catalysts had the best degradation efficiency for meta-xylene, which was 99.6% at the applied voltage of 44\u00a0kV. The by-product ozone concentration was low, and the NO<sub>x</sub> was not detected. Meanwhile, the XPS characterization analysis study revealed that the proportion of Mn<sup>4+</sup> element and the proportion of O<sub>sur</sub> in the Zr-doped Mn-Zr-La/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst were both the highest. The degradation efficiency decreased with the increasing of the initial concentration and gas flow, but first increased and then decreased with the increasing of oxygen content. The fresh and used Mn-Zr-La/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were characterized by SEM, XRD, BET, FT-IR, O<sub>2</sub>-TPD, and the tail gas was treated by GC-MS. Then synergistic degradation mechanism for the meta-xylene by the non-thermal plasma over the Mn-Zr-La/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst are proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
