Both intramolecular energy redistribution and the intermolecular energy transfer in collisions with argon atoms are considered. The sign and magnitude of the intramolecular energy flow between the vibrational and the rotational degrees of freedom crucially depend on the projection K(a) of the total angular momentum of ozone on the body-fixed a axis. The intermolecular energy transfer in single collisions between O(3) and Ar is dominated by transfer of the rotational energy. In accordance with previous theoretical predictions, the direct vibrational de-excitation is exceedingly small. Vibration-rotation relaxation in multiple Ar+O(3) collisions is also studied. It is found that the relaxation proceeds in two clearly distinguishable steps: (1) During the time between collisions, the vibrational degrees of freedom are \"cooled\" by transfer of energy to rotation; even at low pressure equilibration of the internal energy is slow compared to the time between collisions. (2) In collisions, mainly the rotational modes are \"cool\" by energy transfer to argon."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2004 American Institute of Physics."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut fur Stromungsforschung, Bunsenstrasse 10, D-37073 Gottingen, Federal Republic of Germany. mivanov@gwdg.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "Mikhail V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grebenshchikov", "ForeName": "Sergy Yu", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schinke", "ForeName": "Reinhard", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15268022", "10.1063/1.1712866"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
