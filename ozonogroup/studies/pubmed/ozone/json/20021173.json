BAL cells and supernatants taken from rats that received saline or 5-ASA (ip, 50 mg/kg) prior to ozone exposure (0, 0.4, or 0.8 ppm for 4 h) were analyzed for products of lipid oxidation. *OH formation was assessed by analysis of the BAL supernatant for 5-aminotetrahydroxybenzoic acid (5-ATHBA), a hydroxylation product of 5-ASA. The tetrahydroxy derivative of 5-ASA was higher in the BAL of ozone-treated rats than in air controls, reaching significance (p <. 05) at 0.8 ppm of ozone, The products of lipid oxidation propanal and hexanal were higher in BAL cells taken from rats exposed to ozone, reaching significance (p <. 05) at a 0.8 ppm ozone level, compared to air control animals, irrespective of whether they received saline or 5-ASA prior to ozone exposure. Increases in cholesterol levels were also seen in BAL cells after rats were exposed to ozone. However, there were no significant dose-related changes in the lipid oxidation products in BAL supernatants after exposure to ozone. Lipid oxidation products in BAL cells and 5-ATHBA in lavage exhibited the potential to serve as markers of ozone exposure.
