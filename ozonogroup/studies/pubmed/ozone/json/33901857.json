However, direct blending of carbon with Si cannot obtain a synergy composite, resulting in inferior cycle properties during charge-discharge due to huge volume changes and deficient electron-conducting channels from the unavoidably aggregated Si. Herein, the composition of carbon fibers (CNFs) with Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) has been performed through UV-ozone surface modification followed by electrostatic self-assembly. It is found that solvent-free UV-ozone exposure of CNFs for 20\u00a0min successfully introduces carboxylic groups, as conventional acid treatment for 12\u00a0h. Besides UV-ozone surface modification provides an efficient and scalable route, the distribution and functionalization of CNFs can be also modified to effectively combine with amino-functionalized SiNPs. As a result, such Si-CNF composites containing 70.0\u00a0wt% SiNPs are able to exhibit excellent cycle performance with high coulombic efficiency of 74.8% at the 1st cycle and high specific discharge capacity of 1063 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at the 400th cycle."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
