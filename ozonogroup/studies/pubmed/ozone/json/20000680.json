HNM species were measured after chlorination, ozonation-chlorination, chloramination, and ozonation-chloramination, and compared with trihalomethanes (THMs). Pre-ozonation before chlorination resulted in enhanced HNM formation, producing trihalogenated HNMs as major species. Formation of THMs showed very a different formation pattern from HNM formation such that it was much higher in the raw than the treated water, and decreased after pre-ozonation. These findings indicated that precursors and formation pathways for HNMs and THMs are not the same. Increases in pH and bromide concentrations increased HNM and THM formation during ozonation-chlorination and THM formation during chlorination. The bromide effect shifted the formation of HNMs and THMs toward brominated species, with its impact being greater in the treated than raw water. On the other hand, there was no pH or bromide effect on HNM formation during chlorination. The presence of nitrite increased HNM formation under both chlorination and ozonation-chlorination conditions, but it had no influence on THM formation. HNM formation during ozonation-chloramination remained about 1 microg/L level even at the highest bromide and nitrite concentrations. Monochloramination alone did not form any measurable HNMs. The results indicated that the use of chloramine can be an effective way to minimize HNM formation at typical drinking water treatment conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University, Anderson, South Carolina 29625, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Hocheol", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karanfil", "ForeName": "Tanju", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroparaffins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RU5WG8C3F4", "NameOfSubstance": "nitromethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroparaffins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20000680", "10.1021/es902630u"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
