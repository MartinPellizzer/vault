VOC sources were analyzed by a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, and the sensitivity of ozone generation was determined by ozone isopleth plotting research (OZIPR) simulation. The results showed that the average volume concentration of total VOCs was 30.54 ppbv and showed a bimodal feature due to the rush-hour traffic in the morning and at nightfall. The most dominant VOC groups were oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs, 29.3%) and alkanes (26.7%), and the most abundant VOC species were acetone and acetylene. However, based on the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) method, the major VOC groups in terms of ozone formation potential (OFP) contribution were OVOCs (68.09 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 31.5%), aromatics (62.90 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 29.1%) and alkene/alkynes (54.90 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 25.4%). This indicates that the control of OVOCs, aromatics and alkene/alkynes should take priority. Five sources of VOCs were quantified by PMF, including fixed sources of fossil fuel combustion (27.8%), industrial processes (25.9%), vehicle exhaust (19.7%), natural and secondary formation (13.9%) and solvent usage (12.7%). The empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA) curve obtained by OZIPR on O<sub>3</sub> exceedance days indicated that the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity varied in different months. The results provide theoretical support for O<sub>3</sub> pollution prevention and control in Jiaozuo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
