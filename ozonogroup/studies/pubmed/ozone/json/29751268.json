Characterizations and effect of various conditions on DBP removal were investigated. Meanwhile, the mechanism of enhanced DBP degradation after rGO incorporation was explored intensively. Results showed that 5\u202fwt% GO doping into MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> improved the concentration of surface hydroxyl sites (SHSC), the oxidation potential, material diffusion and charge electronic transfer ability in contrast to MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanofibers, resulting in significantly enhanced DBP degradation compared with ozonation alone. Chemisorbed oxygen groups (MnOH, COH or COOH) on the surface of rGO-MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> played a key role in generating radicals, which was the origin of catalytic ozonation reaction. Moreover, a good positive linear relation between SHSC and DBP removal was found. The electrons cycle between Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup> induced the ozone decomposition to produce hydroxyl radicals, which was the major impetus for DBP degradation in 5%rGO-MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system. Composite nanofiber of 5%rGO-MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> had a good stability and removal rate only decreased for 4% after five times reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
