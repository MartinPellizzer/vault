Four PAEs (dimethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate) were detected. The total concentrations of PAEs were 568.9-1847.5\u00a0ng/L in the four WWTP effluents and 39.9-1847.5\u00a0ng/L in the four receiving water bodies. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate had the highest concentration among the PAEs. MPs were mostly in the form of granules and fragments with size <0.01\u00a0mm in the four WWTP effluents (276-1030\u00a0items/L) and receiving water bodies (103-4458\u00a0items/L). The four WWTP effluents were important sources of PAEs to the receiving water bodies in spring but were not likely to be the sources of MPs. The overall removal rates of PAEs and MPs were 47.7%-81.6% and 63.5%-95.4% in the four RWTPs. Low or negative removal rates of PAEs were observed in chlorination and ozonation. Clarification, filtration (except ultrafiltration) and reverse osmosis were the dominant processes, contributing 42.7%-69.2%, 25.3%-59.3%, and 22.6%-51.0%, respectively, of the MP removal in the RWTPs. According to the Spearman analysis results, the levels of PAEs and MPs had more significant correlations with the physicochemical parameters of water samples from the RWTPs (including the WWTP effluents) than those of the receiving water bodies. The results indicated that the levels of PAEs and MPs in surface waters could be significantly influenced by the surrounding environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
