The time evolution of sensitivity coefficients of different order is followed alongside that of the concentrations. Calculation of higher-order sensitivity coefficients requires few modifications to the original (first-order) sensitivity modules and is carried out efficiently and with minimal computational overhead. The modeling results (first-, second-, and third-order sensitivity coefficients) for an ozone episode in central California are shown and discussed. Second-order sensitivity coefficients of ozone concentration with respect to domain-wide NO emissions show reasonable agreement with brute-force results and exhibit less noisy behavior. By using second-order sensitivity coefficients the nonlinear responses are better captured and described. For a Taylor series projection from the base case, including the second-order term improves the accuracy. In general, higher-order sensitivity analysis shows a noticeable improvement in terms of accuracy over the conventional first-order analysis. Of particular interest, second-order sensitivity analysis is better equipped to address the nonlinear behavior around the peak ozone in NO(x)-rich plumes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0512, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hakami", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Odman", "ForeName": "M Talat", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "Armistead G", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12831030", "10.1021/es020677h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
