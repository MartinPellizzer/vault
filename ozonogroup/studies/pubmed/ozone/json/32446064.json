The combination of PMS in O<sub>3</sub> system promoted the O<sub>3</sub> decomposition and NSAIDs removal significantly. O<sub>3</sub> molecule, hydroxyl radical (OH) and sulfate radical (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) were responsible for the removal of target pollutants in O<sub>3</sub>/PMS system. The second-rate constants between O<sub>3</sub>, OH and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> with ASA were determined to be 7.32, 4.18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup> and 3.46\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, and 37.3, 4.99\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup> and 5.64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> for PNT, respectively. The pattern of pollutant removal and contributions of oxidative species were fitted by experiments and two models. Nevertheless, the wide variety of two models suggested that a comprehensive model for O<sub>3</sub>/PMS based on a first-principles approach was not yet possible, due to the number of radicals and subsequent chain reaction, such as SO<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup> or O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. In addition, the formation of five typical CX<sub>3</sub>R -type disinfection by products was evaluated from post\u2011chlorine tests and theoretically calculation by frontier electron density calculation. The calculated toxicity of typical CX<sub>3</sub>R -type DBPs was found to decrease with the increase of pH. The results of this study provide a basis for exploring the mechanism of pollutant degradation in O<sub>3</sub> system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
