Transformation reactions, most importantly sulfidation, lead to the formation of nanoscale silver sulfide (nano-Ag2S) particles. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), ozonation can enhance the effluent quality by eliminating organic micropollutants. The effect of ozonation on the fate of nano-Ag2S, however, is currently unknown. In this study, we investigate the interaction of ozone with nano-Ag2S and evaluate the effect of ozonation on the short-term toxicity of WWTP effluent spiked with nano-Ag2S. The oxidation of nano-Ag2S by ozone resulted in a stoichiometric factor (number of moles of ozone required to oxidize one mole of sulfide to sulfate) of 2.91, which is comparable to the results obtained for the reaction of bisulfide (HS(-)) with ozone. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of nano-Ag2S with ozone (k = 3.1 \u00d7 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) is comparable to the rate constant of fast-reacting micropollutants. Analysis of the ozonation products of nano-Ag2S by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that ozonation dominantly led to the formation of silver chloride in WWTP effluent. After ozonation of the Ag2S-spiked effluent, the short-term toxicity for the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii increased and reached EC50 values comparable to Ag(+). This study thus reveals that ozone treatment of WWTP effluent results in the oxidation of Ag2S and, hence, an increase of the Ag toxicity in the effluent, which may become relevant at elevated Ag concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich , CH-8093 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Thalmann", "ForeName": "Basilius", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Voegelin", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics, ETH Z\u00fcrich , CH-8092 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics, ETH Z\u00fcrich , CH-8092 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Behra", "ForeName": "Renata", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich , CH-8093 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Morgenroth", "ForeName": "Eberhard", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , \u00dcberlandstrasse 133, CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Kaegi", "ForeName": "Ralf", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9ZB10YHC1C", "NameOfSubstance": "silver sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MWB0804EO7", "NameOfSubstance": "silver chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Silver Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26270654", "10.1021/acs.est.5b02194"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
