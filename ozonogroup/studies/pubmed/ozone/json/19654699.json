SPATRAM is a multi-purpose UV-Vis-scanning spectrometer (250 - 950 nm) and it is installed at the Observatory of the CGE, in Evora, since April 2004. A brief description of the instrument is given, highlighting the technological innovations with respect to the previous version of similar equipment. The need for such measurements automatically taken on a routine basis in south-western European regions, specifically in Portugal, has encouraged the development and installation of the equipment and constitutes a major driving force for the present work. The main features and some improvements introduced in the DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) algorithms are discussed. The results obtained applying DOAS methodology to the SPATRAM spectrometer measurements of diffused spectral sky radiation are presented in terms of diurnal and seasonal variations of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)). NO(2) confirms the typical seasonal cycle reaching the maximum of (6.5 +/- 0.3) x 10(+15) molecules cm(-2) for the sunset values (PM), during the summer season, and the minimum of (1.55 +/- 0.07) x 10(+15) molecules cm(-2) for the sunrise values (AM) in winter. O(3) presents the maximum total column of (433 +/- 5) Dobson Unit (DU) in the spring season and the minimum of (284 +/- 3) DU during the fall period. The huge daily variations of the O(3) total column during the spring season are analyzed and discussed. The ground-based results obtained for NO(2) and O(3) column contents are compared with data from satellite-borne equipment (GOME - Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment; SCIAMACHY - Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY; TOMS - Total Ozone Monitoring Spectrometer) and it is shown that the two data sets are in good agreement. The correlation coefficient for the comparison of the ground-based/satellite data for O(3) is of 0.97."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Evora Geophysics Centre, University of Evora, Rua Rom\u00e3o Ramalho 59, 7000 Evora, Portugal. d.bortoli@isac.cnr.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bortoli", "ForeName": "Daniele", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Ana Maria", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "Maria Jo\u00e3o", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Domingues", "ForeName": "Ana Filipa", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giovanelli", "ForeName": "Giorgio", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Express", "NlmUniqueID": "101137103", "ISSNLinking": "1094-4087"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Portugal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19654699", "10.1364/oe.17.012944", "183637"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
