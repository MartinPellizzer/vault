The one-dimensional model accounts for molecular diffusion from bulk air to the air-material interface, reaction at the interface, and diffusive transport and reaction through material pore volumes. Material-ozone reaction probabilities that account for internal transport and internal pore area, \u03b3(ipa), are determined by a minimization of residuals between predicted and experimentally derived ozone concentrations. Values of \u03b3(ipa) are generally less than effective reaction probabilities (\u03b3(eff)) determined previously, likely because of the inclusion of diffusion into substrates and reaction with internal surface area (rather than the use of the horizontally projected external material areas). Estimates of \u03b3(ipa) average 1 \u00d7 10(-7), 2 \u00d7 10(-7), 4 \u00d7 10(-5), 2 \u00d7 10(-5), and 4 \u00d7 10(-7) for two types of cellulose paper, pervious pavement, Portland cement concrete, and an activated carbon cloth, respectively. The transport and reaction model developed here accounts for observed differences in ozone removal to varying thicknesses of the cellulose paper, and estimates a near constant \u03b3(ipa) as material thickness increases from 0.02 to 0.16 cm."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Nanyang Technological University and Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore, 1 Create Way #11-01 Create Tower, Singapore, 138602."}], "LastName": "Gall", "ForeName": "Elliott T", "Initials": "ET"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Department of Civil Engineering and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, 35 St. George St., Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Siegel", "ForeName": "Jeffrey A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1786, Austin, Texas 78712, United States."}], "LastName": "Corsi", "ForeName": "Richard L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Porosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25748309", "10.1021/acs.est.5b00023"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
