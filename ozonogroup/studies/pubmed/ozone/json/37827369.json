While epidemiologic evidence has suggested a positive association with type 2 diabetes (T2D), there is heterogeneity in findings. We evaluated exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> across three large samples in the US using a harmonized approach for exposure assignment and covariate adjustment.", "Data were obtained from the Veterans Administration Diabetes Risk (VADR) cohort (electronic health records [EHRs]), the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Disparities in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort (primary data collection), and the Geisinger health system (EHRs), and reflect the years 2003-2016 (REGARDS) and 2008-2016 (VADR and Geisinger). New onset T2D was ascertained using EHR information on medication orders, laboratory results, and T2D diagnoses (VADR and Geisinger) or report of T2D medication or diagnosis and/or elevated blood glucose levels (REGARDS). Exposure was assigned using pollutant annual averages from the Downscaler model. Models stratified by community type (higher density urban, lower density urban, suburban/small town, or rural census tracts) evaluated likelihood of new onset T2D in each study sample in single- and two-pollutant models of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>.", "In two pollutant models, associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and new onset T2D were null in the REGARDS cohort except for in suburban/small town community types in models that also adjusted for NSEE, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 1.51 (1.01, 2.25) per 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Results in the Geisinger sample were null. VADR sample results evidenced nonlinear associations for both pollutants; the shape of the association was dependent on community type.", "Associations between PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and new onset T2D differed across three large study samples in the US.
