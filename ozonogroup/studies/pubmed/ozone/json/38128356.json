The objective of this study is to determine the socioeconomic and air-quality contributions to pediatric epistaxis. The study also evaluates the utility of diagnostic lab work as a predictor of bleeding rates and need for operative intervention.", "A case series of pediatric patients treated in an outpatient Otolaryngology clinic at a tertiary care children's hospital in 2021 for epistaxis was performed. Patients with nasal bone trauma (n\u00a0=\u00a08), consult while inpatient (n\u00a0=\u00a07), and those with nasal masses (n\u00a0=\u00a02) were excluded; 181 patients met inclusion criteria. Demographic, clinical, socioeconomic, and air quality (tropospheric ozone, particulate matter) data were recorded. Associations with persistent bleeding and operative interventions were evaluated using logistic regression, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Spearman rank correlation.", "Of the 181 patients, 75 (41.4%) were female. Forty-six of 181 (25.4%) had associated allergic symptoms. Twenty-six patients had allergy testing; 14/26 (53.8%) of these had positive results. Re-bleeding was more common in those with allergic symptoms (OR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.22-4.78, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Patients with re-bleeding lived in counties with more days with ozone over the US standard (median 5 days, range 0-32 days) compared with those with no re-bleeding (median 3 days, range 0-32 days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). There was also an association between the number of visits for re-bleed and percent below poverty level (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.259, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) as well as the number of days with particulate matter levels over the US standard (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.343, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Coagulopathy was present in 9/54 (16.7%) patients, with the majority being Von Willebrand disease (5/54, 9.3%). Easy bruising was not significantly associated with positive lab results.", "Environmental pollution, living in a zip code with more residents below the poverty level, and allergic rhinitis were positively associated with recurrent epistaxis.
