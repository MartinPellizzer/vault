A high-sensitivity proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) was deployed in vastly different atmospheres in southern China, including an urban site (SZ-U), a regional site (NA-R), and a background site (NL-B). Four critical OVOCs, i.e., methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and acetaldehyde, five groups of aromatic hydrocarbons, isoprene and acetonitrile were measured with a high time resolution. The featured relative abundance and diurnal variations of the OVOCs indicated that methanol, acetone and MEK had prominent contributions from urban industrial activities, while acetaldehyde was closely related to the photochemical formation at all three sites. The photochemical age-based parameterization method was improved locally and then applied to quantify different sources of daytime OVOCs: anthropogenic secondary and biogenic sources (together 60-73%) were always the dominant source for acetaldehyde in various atmospheres; in addition to a significant background for methanol, acetone and MEK, anthropogenic primary emissions (mostly industrial) were their dominant source at SZ-U (38-73%), while biogenic sources played the key role for them at NL-B (30-43%); biomass burning contributed a small fraction of 5-17% for the four OVOCs at the three sites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
