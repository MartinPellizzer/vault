Following accompanying papers on synoptic circulation impact and key weather elements and emission contributions (Gong et al., 2022a; Gong et al., 2022b), an emission-driven Observation-based Box Model (e-OBM) was developed to study the impact mechanisms on O<sub>3</sub> trend and quantitatively assess the effects of variation in the emissions control over 2013-2020 for Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shanghai. Compared with the original OBM, the e-OBM not only improves the performance to simulate the hourly O<sub>3</sub> peak concentration in daytime, but also reasonably reproduces the maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the four cities. Based upon the sensitivity experiments, it is found that the meteorology is the dominant driver for the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> trend, contributing from about 32 % to 139 % to the variations. From the mechanistic point of view, the variations of meteorology lead to the enhancement of atmospheric oxidation capacity and the acceleration of O<sub>3</sub> production. Further evaluation to the emission changes in four cities shows that the O<sub>3</sub>-precursors relationships of the four cities have been changed from the VOC-limited regime in 2013 to the transition regime or near-transition regime in 2020. Though the NO<sub>x</sub>/VOCs ratios have been obviously decreased, the emission reductions up to 2020 were still not enough to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution in these cities. It is emphasized in this study that the strengthened control measures with maintaining a certain ratio of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs should be implemented to further curb the increasing trend of O<sub>3</sub> in urban areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
