For comparative purposes, ECs have also been treated by ultraviolet radiation (UVA radiation, black light) and ozonation (pH 3 and 7). With the exception of UVA radiation, O3-based processes lead to the total removal of ECs in the mixture. The time taken to achieve complete degradation depends on the oxidation process applied. Ozonation at pH 3 is the most effective technique. The addition of iron based catalysts results in a slight inhibition of the parent compounds degradation rate. However, a positive effect is experienced when measuring the total organic carbon (TOC) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals. Photocatalytic oxidation in the presence of Fe(3+) leads to 81% and 88% of TOC and COD elimination, respectively, compared to only 23% and 29% of TOC and COD removals achieved by single ozonation. The RCT concept has been used to predict the theoretical ECs profiles in the homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process studied. Treated wastewater effluent was toxic to Daphnia magna when Fe(3+) was used in photocatalytic ozonation. In this case, toxicity was likely due to the ferryoxalate formed in the process. Single ozonation significantly reduced the toxicity of the treated wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Chemical Engineering and Physics Chemistry Department , University of Extremadura , Badajoz , Spain."}], "LastName": "Espejo", "ForeName": "Azahara", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beltr\u00e1n", "ForeName": "Fernando J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rivas", "ForeName": "Francisco J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Araya", "ForeName": "Juan F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gimeno", "ForeName": "Olga", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25837558", "10.1080/10934529.2015.994939"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
