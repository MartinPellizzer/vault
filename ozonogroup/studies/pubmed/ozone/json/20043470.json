These \"therapies\" are offered at clinics in Mexico, the United States, and Europe. Proponents claim that many diseases, including cancer, are caused by oxygen deficiency and that oxygenation can restore health by destroying cancer cells, eliminating pathogens, stimulating metabolism, and by producing \"oxidative detoxification.\" There is no scientific evidence to support any of these claims. Oxygen therapies include: (1) hydrogen peroxide therapy involving intravenous infusion, ingestion, colonic administration, or soaking in hydrogen peroxide solution; (2) ozone colonies and ozone autohemotherapy, in which blood is withdrawn and treated with ozone before reinfusion, and (3) \"oxygenated\" water, pills, and solutions. The use of oxygen therapies has resulted in serious adverse events and several deaths. Oxygen therapies should not be confused with those commonly used in respiratory care."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integrative Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cassileth", "ForeName": "Barrie", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Oncology (Williston Park)", "NlmUniqueID": "8712059", "ISSNLinking": "0890-9091"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20043470", "166382"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
