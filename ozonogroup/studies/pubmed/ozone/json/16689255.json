The supplemental UV-B radiation was 5.00 kJ x m(-2), simulating a depletion of 20% stratospheric ozone in Kunming area. The results showed that six of 10 tested wheat cultivars showed significant changes in total chlorophyll content, among which, chlorophyll a was strongly reduced, but chlorophyll b was reduced to a lesser extent, leading to a decrease in chlorophyll a/b ratio. The effects of UV-B on MDA and flavonoid contents also showed intraspecific difference. The MDA content of 5 cultivars was significant increased, while that of 2 cultivars was decreased. Four cultivars had significantly increased flavonoid content, but the flavonoid content in 2 cultivars was significantly decreased. The changes of chlorophyll and flavonoid contents were significantly correlated with the content of MDA(r = -0.78, P < 0.01 and r = -0.75, P < 0.05 respectively). There was a correlation between flavonoid and anti-UV-B radiation of wheat."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunnzing, China. helilian905@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lilian", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zu", "ForeName": "Yanqun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yusheng", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5712ZB110R", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorophyll b"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16689255"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
