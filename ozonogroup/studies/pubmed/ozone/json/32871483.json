Low-cost O<sub>3</sub> sensors, such as metal oxide (MO) sensors, can complement regulatory O<sub>3</sub> measurements and enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of measurements. However, the quality of MO sensor data remains a challenge. The University of Utah has a network of low-cost air quality sensors (called AirU) that primarily measures PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations around the Salt Lake City valley (Utah, U.S.). The AirU package also contains a low-cost MO sensor ($8) that measures oxidizing/reducing species. These MO sensors exhibited excellent laboratory response to O<sub>3</sub> although they exhibited some intra-sensor variability. Field performance was evaluated by placing eight AirUs at two Division of Air Quality (DAQ) monitoring stations with O<sub>3</sub> federal equivalence methods for one year to develop long-term multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) calibration models to predict O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Six sensors served as train/test sets. The remaining two sensors served as a holdout set to evaluate the applicability of the new calibration models in predicting O<sub>3</sub> concentrations for other sensors of the same type. A rigorous variable selection method was also performed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), MLR and ANN models. The variable selection indicated that the AirU's MO oxidizing species and temperature measurements and DAQ's solar radiation measurements were the most important variables. The MLR calibration model exhibited moderate performance (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.491), and the ANN exhibited good performance (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.767) for the holdout set. We also evaluated the performance of the MLR and ANN models in predicting O<sub>3</sub> for five months after the calibration period and the results showed moderate correlations (R<sup>2</sup>s of 0.427 and 0.567, respectively). These low-cost MO sensors combined with a long-term ANN calibration model can complement reference measurements to understand geospatial and temporal differences in O<sub>3</sub> levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
