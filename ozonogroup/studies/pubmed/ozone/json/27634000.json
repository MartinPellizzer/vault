The measurement data showed that the concentrations of most air pollutants decreased during these years. However, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and total non-methane hydrocarbon levels increased with the rate of 0.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and 0.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0ppbv/year, respectively, pointing to the increasing severity of photochemical pollution in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has ongoing programs to improve air quality in Hong Kong, including a solvent program implemented during 2007-2011, and a diesel commercial vehicle (DCV) program since 2007. From before to after the solvent program, the sum of toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers decreased continuously with an average rate of\u00a0-99.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9\u00a0pptv/year, whereas the sum of ethene and propene increased by 48.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0pptv/year from before to during the DCV program. Despite this, source apportionment results showed that VOCs emitted from diesel exhaust decreased at a rate of\u00a0-304.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.7\u00a0pptv/year, while solvent related VOCs decreased at a rate of\u00a0-204.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a039.7\u00a0pptv/year. The gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas vehicle emissions elevated by 1086\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034\u00a0pptv/year, and were responsible for the increases of ethene and propene. Overall, the simulated O<sub>3</sub> rate of increase was lowered from 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 to 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0ppbv/year by the solvent and DCV programs, because O<sub>3</sub> produced by solvent usage and diesel exhaust related VOCs decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 and 0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0ppbv/year between 2005 and 2013, respectively. However, enhanced VOC emissions from gasoline and LPG vehicles accounted for most of the O<sub>3</sub> increment (0.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 out of 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0ppbv/year) in these years. To maintain a zero O<sub>3</sub> increment in 2020 relative to 2010, the lowest reduction ratio of VOCs/NOx was \u223c1.5 under the NOx reduction of 20-30% which was based on the emission reduction plan for Pearl River Delta region in 2020."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
