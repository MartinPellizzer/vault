This study aimed to investigate potential associations of long-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone with all-cause mortality in Chinese older adults.", "A dynamic nationwide prospective cohort comprising 20,352 adults aged \u226565 years were enrolled from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study and followed up through 2005-2018. Participants' annual exposures to warm-season ozone and year-round PM<sub>2.5</sub> were assigned using satellite-derived spatiotemporal estimates. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was developed to identify confounding variables. Associations of annual mean exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone with mortality were evaluated using single- and two-pollutant Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for time-dependent individual risk factors and ambient temperature.", "During 100 thousand person-years of follow-up (median: 3.6 years), a total of 14,313 death events occurred. The participants were averagely aged 87.1 years at baseline and exposed to a wide range of annual average concentrations of warm-season maximum 8-hour ozone (mean, 54.4 ppb; range, 23.3-81.6 ppb) and year-round PM<sub>2.5</sub> (mean, 65.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>; range, 10.1-162.9\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). Approximately linear concentration-response relationship was identified for ozone, whereas significant increases in PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated mortality risks were observed only when concentrations were above 60\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Rises of 10 ppb in ozone and 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> in PM<sub>2.5</sub> above 60\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> were associated with increases in all-cause mortality of 13.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.2-16.2%) and 6.2% (95% CI: 4.6-7.7%) in DAG-based single-pollutant model, and of 9.7% (95% CI: 6.6-13.0%) and 5.3% (95% CI: 3.7-6.9%) in DAG-based two-pollutant model, respectively. We detected significant effect modification by temperature in associations of mortality with ozone (P\u00a0<0.001 for interaction), suggesting greater ozone-related risks among participants in warmer locations.", "This study provided longitudinal evidence that long-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone significantly and independently contributed to elevated risks of all-cause mortality among older adults in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
