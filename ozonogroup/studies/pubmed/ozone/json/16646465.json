In this study, the formation of aerosols and gas-phase products from the ozonolysis and photooxidation of a series of biogenic hydrocarbons (isoprene, 8 monoterpenes, 4 sesquiterpenes, and 3 oxygenated terpenes) are examined. By comparing aerosol growth (measured by Differential Mobility Analyzers, DMAs) and gas-phase concentrations (monitored by a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer, PTR-MS), we study the general mechanisms of SOA formation. Aerosol growth data are presented in terms of a \"growth curve\", a plot of aerosol mass formed versus the amount of hydrocarbon reacted. From the shapes of the growth curves, it is found that all the hydrocarbons studied can be classified into two groups based entirely on the number of double bonds of the hydrocarbon, regardless of the reaction systems (ozonolysis or photooxidation) and the types of hydrocarbons studied: compounds with only one double bond and compounds with more than one double bond. For compounds with only one double bond, the first oxidation step is rate-limiting, and aerosols are formed mainly from low volatility first-generation oxidation products; whereas for compounds with more than one double bond, the second oxidation step may also be rate-limiting and second-generation products contribute substantially to SOA growth. This behavior is characterized by a vertical section in the growth curve, in which continued aerosol growth is observed even after all the parent hydrocarbon is consumed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "Nga L", "Initials": "NL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kroll", "ForeName": "Jesse H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keywood", "ForeName": "Melita D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bahreini", "ForeName": "Roya", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varutbangkul", "ForeName": "Varuntida", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flagan", "ForeName": "Richard C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seinfeld", "ForeName": "John H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Anita", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16646465", "10.1021/es052269u"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
