A higher bioavailability can reduce both the applied dosage and the side effects for the patient. One method of increasing the bioavailability is to reduce the particle size of the drug down to the nanoscale. An innovative procedure for the preparation of particles in the submicron size range is spray drying with aerosol conditioning, followed by subsequent separation of the particles in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). This process has been tested before in an earlier work with aqueous model substances at high production rates (1\u202fg/h) and narrow particle-size distributions (mannitol: d<sub>50,0</sub>\u202f=\u202f455\u202fnm, span\u202f=\u202f0,8) in the submicron range. Spray drying from an aqueous solution with low drug concentrations (<1\u202fwt-%) leads to particles in the lower nanosize range, but the low concentrations make this process inefficient. A custom-made plant was modified in order to handle the organic spray-drying process. In addition, explosion protection had to be considered. This work focuses on the spray drying of submicron particles from organic solvents for the purpose of increasing the dissolution rate of the API griseofulvin. API particles were successfully produced in the submicron size-range, characterized and the dissolution behavior was investigated. The dissolution time to dissolve 80% of the drug, t<sub>80</sub>, was reduced from 21.5\u202fmin for the micronized grade API to 8.5\u202fmin for the submicron product."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
