Cultivation was performed according to standard techniques involving the stem cell assay in soft agar as well as the monolayer technique in liquid nutrient media. The type of culture system did not influence the sensitivity of the culture cells to ozone and/or irradiation. Ozone treatment was performed with three different Ozone concentrations (0.03 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 0.3 ppm). Irradiation was done with 100 rd Ra226, Ir192 or Co60. A control experiment showed that the proliferative tendency of benign cells (skin fibroblasts) was not inhibited by the three ozone concentrations used in this study. Ra226 and even the combination of ozone and Radium did not influence the proliferative activity of these benign cells. Ir192 and Co60 were cytotoxic to benign as well as to carcinoma cells. Cultivated cells from endometrial carcinoma resisted to ozone treatment as well as to Ra226 (but they were destroyed by Ir119 and Co60). After pretreatment with ozone (0.1 ppm), Ra226 treatment of endometrial carcinoma cells induced a cytostatic effect implying that no cell divisions were observed after irradiation and the cells lysed within two weeks after irradiation. For the three ovarian carcinoma cell lines analysed in this study ozone treatment had a cytostatic effect even at the lowest concentration (0.03 ppm), with the two higher ozone concentrations a cytotoxic effect could be induced in ovarian carcinoma cells. Exclusive treatment with Ra226 induced a cytostatic effect, but it was cytotoxic after combination with ozone treatment of the lowest concentration (Ir192 and Co60 were cytotoxic in all cases). Our investigation confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of ozone treatment. Furthermore it was shown that exclusive ozone treatment even without combined irradiation displayed a selective cytotoxic action at the ovarian carcinoma cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karlic", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kucera", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Metka", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sch\u00f6nbauer", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00f6regi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Zur Wirkung von Ozon und ionisierender Strahlung am In-vitro-Modell--eine Pilotstudie an vier gyn\u00e4kologischen Tumoren."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Strahlenther Onkol", "NlmUniqueID": "8603469", "ISSNLinking": "0179-7158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cobalt Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Sensitizing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "44448S9773", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W90AYD6R3Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Radium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cobalt Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Genital Neoplasms, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Sensitizing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3810475"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
