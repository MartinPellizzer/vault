However, cost-effective nano-catalysts separation remains a challenge. In this study, membrane separation processes were employed to separate nano-MgO catalysts from an ozonation system. A continuous nano-catalytic ozonation membrane separation (nCOMS) coupling system was successfully constructed for treating quinoline. The results showed that long hydraulic retention time (HRT) and high nano-MgO dosage could improve the quinolone removal efficiency but shorten operation cycles. At the optimal operation conditions of HRT\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0h and nano-MgO dosage\u00a0=\u00a00.2\u00a0g/L, the nCOMS system achieved a stable quinoline removal efficiency of 85.2% for 240\u00a0min running with a transmembrane pressure lower than 10\u00a0kPa. The quinoline removal efficiency contribution for ozonation, catalysis and membrane separation was 57.1%, 24.9% and 18.0%, respectively. Compared to ozonation membrane separation system, the fouling rate index of the nCOMS system increased by 60% under optimal conditions, but the irreversible fouling was reduced to 28%. In addition, the nCOMS system exhibited reduced adverse effects of coexisting natural organic matter (NOM) on quinoline removal and membrane fouling. In conclusion, the nCOMS system demonstrated higher quinoline removal efficiency, lower irreversible fouling, and reduced adverse effect of coexisting NOM, thereby signifying its potential for practical applications in advanced treatment of industrial wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
