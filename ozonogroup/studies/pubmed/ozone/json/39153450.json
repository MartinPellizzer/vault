In this study, the cotransport of six kinds of pristine and aged MPs and the antiager ozonation product N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD-Q) were investigated via a series of batch and transport experiments, and characteristic analysis (e.g., SEM, FTIR and XPS). Generally, pristine MPs exhibit higher adsorption ability than aged MPs due to the hydrophobic interaction. The 6PPD-Q usually exhibited both free moving and bond-MPs moving during transport process in presence of MPs, but none free 6PPD-Q was detected in presence of pristine PP MPs. The mobility of 6PPD-Q was generally facilitated in presence of MPs by bond-MPs moving due to the hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction (the maximum total mass recovery of 84.11%), which efficiency was influenced with the combined effect of adsorption ability and mobility of MPs. The pristine PVC MPs showed highest facilitation on 6PPD-Q transport. The retained 6PPD-Q in porous media also was released by various MPs with different mass recovery ranged from 15.72% to 56.26% via surface moving of MPs around porous media. Both the dissolved and retained 6PPD-Q decreased the MPs mobility with the minimum mass recovery of 34.02%. Findings from this study contribute to the prediction and assessment of the combined risks of MPs and 6PPD-Q."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
