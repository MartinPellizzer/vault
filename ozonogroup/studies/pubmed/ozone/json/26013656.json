Measurement results showed that the O3 concentration in this industrial area was significantly higher, with the mean daily average of 124.6 \u03bcg/m(3) and mean daily maximum of 236.8 \u03bcg/m(3), which are, respectively, 90.9 and 50.6 % higher than those in Beijing urban area. Moreover, the diurnal O3 peak generally started up early in 11:00-12:00 and usually remained for 5-6 h, greatly different with the normal diurnal pattern of urban O3. Then, we used NCAR-MM to simulate the average diurnal variation of photochemical O3 in sunny days of August 2010 in both industrial and urban areas. A good agreement in O3 diurnal variation pattern and in O3 relative level was obtained for both areas. For example of O3 daily maximum, the calculated value in the industrial area was about 51 % higher than in the urban area, while measured value in the industrial area was approximately 60 % higher than in the urban area. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of photochemical O3 to its precursors was conducted based on a set of VOCs/NOx emissions cases. Simulation results implied that in the industrial area, the response of O3 to VOCs was negative and to NOx was positive under the current conditions, with the sensitivity coefficients of -0.16~-0.43 and +0.04~+0.06, respectively. By contrast, the urban area was within the VOCs-limitation regime, where ozone enhancement in response to increasing VOCs emissions and to decreasing NOx emission. So, we think that the VOCs emissions control for this petrochemical industrial complex will increase the potential risk of local ozone pollution aggravation, but will be helpful to inhibit the ozone formation in Beijing urban area through reducing the VOCs transport from the industrial area to the urban area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, 100124, China, weiwei@bjut.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Zhaofeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Shuiyuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lili", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Dongsheng", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Lihui", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Litao", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2012 Apr;184(4):1879-89", "ArticleIdList": ["21552987"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2009 Jul 1;407(14):4312-9", "ArticleIdList": ["19423150"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Sci (China). 2014 Feb 1;26(2):332-42", "ArticleIdList": ["25076524"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 27;101(17):6346-50", "ArticleIdList": ["15084740"]}, {"Citation": "Huan Jing Ke Xue. 2012 Dec;33(12):4141-50", "ArticleIdList": ["23379135"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Sci (China). 2012;24(1):95-101", "ArticleIdList": ["22783619"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26013656", "10.1007/s10661-015-4620-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
