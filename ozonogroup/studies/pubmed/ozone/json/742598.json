Animals were exposed to 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 ppm of each gas alone and to the combination at concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 ppm. In these experiments sulfur dioxide alone produced no statistically significant alterations in respiration. All concentrations of ozone produced an increase in respiratory frequency. At the two higher concentrations the increase in frequency was accompanied by a decrease in compliance. The response to the combinations was the same as the response to those levels of ozone alone. No sulfuric acid was detected in the chamber atmosphere. The biological data suggest that none was formed in the lung."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amdur", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ugro", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Underhill", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Ind Hyg Assoc J", "NlmUniqueID": "0371160", "ISSNLinking": "0002-8894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["742598", "10.1080/0002889778507895"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
