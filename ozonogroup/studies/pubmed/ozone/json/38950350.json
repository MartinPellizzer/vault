In this study, we report a methodology for achieving selective deposition of high-<i>k</i> dielectrics by surface modification through vapor-phase functionalization of octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) inhibitor molecules accompanied by post-surface treatment. A comparative evaluation of deposition selectivity of ZrO<sub>2</sub> thin films deposited with the O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> reactants was performed on SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiN, and W substrates, and we confirmed that high enough deposition selectivity over 10 nm can be achieved even after 200 cycles of ALD with the O<sub>2</sub> reactant. Subsequently, the electrical properties of ZrO<sub>2</sub> films deposited with O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> reactants were investigated with and without post-deposition treatment. We successfully demonstrated that high-quality ZrO<sub>2</sub> thin films with high dielectric constants and stable antiferroelectric properties can be produced by subjecting the films to ozone, which can eliminate carbon impurities within the films. We believe that this work provides a new strategy to achieve highly selective deposition for AS-ALD of dielectric on dielectric (DoD) applications toward upcoming bottom-up nanofabrication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2629-0144"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, BK21 FOUR ERICA-ACE Center, Hanyang University, Ansan, Gyeonggi 15588, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jeong-Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, BK21 FOUR ERICA-ACE Center, Hanyang University, Ansan, Gyeonggi 15588, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seo-Hyun", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SK Specialty Co., Ltd., 59-33 Gaheunggongdan-ro, Yeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do 36059, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ji Hun", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SK Specialty Co., Ltd., 59-33 Gaheunggongdan-ro, Yeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do 36059, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kwak", "ForeName": "Junghun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SK Specialty Co., Ltd., 59-33 Gaheunggongdan-ro, Yeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do 36059, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jinhee", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0868-7479"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, BK21 FOUR ERICA-ACE Center, Hanyang University, Ansan, Gyeonggi 15588, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Woo-Hee", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "51"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38950350", "10.1021/acsami.4c04558"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
