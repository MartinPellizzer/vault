In most studies, however, the interaction between O<sub>3</sub> and plants has not been considered and there are uncertainties in land cover input and emission factors (EFs) in BVOCs emission estimation, particularly at the regional scale. In this study, an O<sub>3</sub> exposure-isoprene (ISOP) response function was developed using meta-analysis, and the EFs of ISOP and land cover inputs were updated by integrating local measurement and investigation data in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Five different cases were developed to explore the impacts of O<sub>3</sub> and input variables on the BVOCs emissions using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). The impacts of those variables on O<sub>3</sub> simulation were further examined with air quality modeling. We found that the ISOP emissions were restrained in the city cluster along the Yangtze River during the growing season due to their negative feedback to O<sub>3</sub> exposure for deciduous broadleaf forests. The estimation of BVOCs emissions strongly depended on EFs, and the global EFs underestimated the ISOP emissions in July by 37%, mostly in southern YRD. Different land cover datasets with various fractions and spatial distributions of plant function types resulted in a variation of 200-400 Gg in ISOP emissions in July across YRD. Air quality modeling indicated that BVOCs contributed 10%, 12%, and 11% to the 1-h mean, the maximum daily 1-h average, and the maximum daily 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, respectively, for July across the YRD region. Due to the NOx restriction, the spatial distribution of BVOCs emissions was inconsistent with that of their contribution to O<sub>3</sub> formation. The O<sub>3</sub> simulation was more sensitive to the changed BVOCs emissions in the area with relatively large contribution of BVOCs to O<sub>3</sub> formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
