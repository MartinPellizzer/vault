The 24 1,3-dipoles are of the formula X\u2261Y(+)-Z(-) (where X is HC or N, Y is N, and Z is CH(2), NH, or O) or X\u2550Y(+)-Z(-) (where X and Z are CH(2), NH, or O and Y is NH, O, or S). The high-accuracy G3B3 method was employed as the reference. CBS-QB3, CCSD(T)//B3LYP, SCS-MP2//B3LYP, B3LYP, M06-2X, and B97-D methods were benchmarked to assess their accuracies and to determine an accurate method that is practical for large systems. Several basis sets were also evaluated. Compared to the G3B3 method, CBS-QB3 and CCSD(T)/maug-cc-pV(T+d)Z//B3LYP methods give similar results for both activation and reaction enthalpies (mean average deviation, MAD, < 1.5 kcal/mol). SCS-MP2//B3LYP and M06-2X give small errors for the activation enthalpies (MAD < 1.5 kcal/mol), while B3LYP has MAD = 2.3 kcal/mol. SCS-MP2//B3LYP and B3LYP give the reasonable reaction enthalpies (MAD < 5.0 kcal/mol). The B3LYP functional also gives good results for most 1,3-dipoles (MAD = 1.9 kcal/mol for 17 common 1,3-dipoles), but the activation and reaction enthalpies for ozone and sulfur dioxide are difficult to calculate by any of the density functional methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095-1569, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Lufeng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Houk", "ForeName": "K N", "Initials": "KN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21967148", "10.1021/jp207563h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
