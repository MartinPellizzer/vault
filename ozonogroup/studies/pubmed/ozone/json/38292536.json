The COVID-19 pandemic provided the unintended experiment of reduced on-road emissions' impacts on air pollution due to lockdowns across the United States. Studies have quantified on-road transportation's impact on fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)-attributable and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)-attributable adverse health outcomes in the United States, and other studies have quantified air pollution-attributable health outcome reductions due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. We aim to quantify the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-attributable, O<sub>3</sub>-attributable, and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)-attributable adverse health outcomes from traffic emissions as well as the air pollution benefits due to reduced on-road activity during the pandemic in 2020. We estimate 79,400 (95% CI 46,100-121,000) premature mortalities each year due to on-road-attributable PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>. We further break down the impacts by pollutant and vehicle types (passenger [PAS] vs. freight [FRT] vehicles). We estimate PAS vehicles to be responsible for 63% of total impacts and FRT vehicles 37%. Nitrogen oxide (NO<i><sub>X</sub></i>) emissions from these vehicles are responsible for 78% of total impacts as it is a precursor for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Utilizing annual vehicle miles traveled reductions in 2020, we estimate that 9,300 (5,500-14,000) deaths from air pollution were avoided in 2020 due to the state-specific reductions in on-road activity across the continental United States. By quantifying the air pollution public health benefits from lockdown-related reductions in on-road emissions, the results from this study stress the need for continued emission mitigation policies, like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recently proposed NO<i><sub>X</sub></i> standards for heavy-duty vehicles, to mitigate on-road transportation's public health impact."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
