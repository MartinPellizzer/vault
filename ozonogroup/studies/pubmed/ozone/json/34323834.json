Information concerning the identity, amounts and spatial distribution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which drive ozone and aerosol formation is still largely unknown as existing global emission inventories have poor VOC speciation and rely on limited satellite overpasses for mapping burnt areas. Here, emission factors (EFs) of 77 VOCs were measured from paddy fire smoke and combined with 1 km \u00d7 1 km stubble burning activity constrained by annual crop production yields and detected fires to compile a new gridded emission inventory for 2017. Our results reveal a large source of acetaldehyde (37.5 \u00b1 9.6 Ggy<sup>-1</sup>), 2-furaldehyde (37.1 \u00b1 12.5 Ggy<sup>-1</sup>), acetone (34.7 \u00b1 13.6 Ggy<sup>-1</sup>), benzene (9.9 \u00b1 2.8 Ggy<sup>-1</sup>) and isocyanic acid (0.4 \u00b1 0.2 Ggy<sup>-1</sup>) that are not accounted for by existing emission inventories (GFED, GFAS, FINv2.1). During October-November, these emissions (346 \u00b1 65 Ggy<sup>-1</sup> NMVOC; 38 \u00b1 8 Ggy<sup>-1</sup> NO<sub>x</sub>; 16 \u00b1 4 Ggy<sup>-1</sup> NH<sub>3</sub>; 129 \u00b1 9 Ggy<sup>-1</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub>; 22,125 \u00b1 3674 Ggy<sup>-1</sup> GHG CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents) are more than 20 times larger than corresponding emissions from traffic and municipal waste burning over north-west India. Mitigation of this source alone can therefore yield massive air-quality climate co-benefits for more than 500 million people."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
