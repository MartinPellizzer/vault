In this study, ozone concentration and meteorological parameters in a winter wheat field were measured from 2014 to 2016. We analyzed the variations in ozone concentration and AOT40 during the growing season for winter wheat. According to the revised stomatal model, the leaf stomatal conductance of winter wheat was simulated and verified by comparing with measured results. Based on the flux model, the leaf stomatal fluxes of winter wheat were calculated. In addition, we estimated the effects of ozone concentration on winter wheat dry matter and yield by using exposure-response relationships and flux-response relationships. The results suggested that the concentration of ozone gradually increased during the growing season for winter wheat and showed a distinct unimodal pattern of diurnal variation. The mean concentrations of ozone were 36.2, 37.7, and 33.6 nL\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and the ozone AOT40 values were 17.08, 17.90, and 11.84 \u03bcL\u00b7(L\u00b7h)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, during the growing seasons for winter wheat from 2014 to 2016. The Jarvis-type factorial model of stomatal conductance could be used to simulate the stomatal conductance of winter wheat in the region, and approximately 81% of the variation of measured stomatal conductance could be accounted for by the model. The leaf stomatal ozone fluxes of winter wheat were 9.36, 9.32, and 8.65 mmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, from 2014 to 2016. Winter wheat yield decreased about 18.03%, and its dry matter decreased about 19.31% under ozone stress during these three years."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology(CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "You-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tongzhou District Meteorological Bureau of Beijing, Beijing 101100, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jing-Xin", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology(CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jia-Chen", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology(CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology(CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964596", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201704117"]}}]}
