Results showed that the annual average CO<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration in 2018 decreased by 2% (increased by 19%) when compared with that in 2015. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations exhibited monthly variability, peaking in February (443.7\u00a0ppm) and reaching their lowest levels in July (363.0\u00a0ppm); whereas, monthly O<sub>3</sub> showed a bimodal pattern with peaks in June (51.3\u00a0ppb) and September (34.5\u00a0ppb). Regarding the diurnal variation, the maximum CO<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration occurred at nighttime (in the daytime) and a minimum CO<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>) in the daytime (at nighttime). As demonstrated by correlation analysis, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> variations were partly modulated by NOx and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Furthermore, CO<sub>2</sub> showed significant positive correlations with relative humidity in winter, while O<sub>3</sub> showed strong positive correlations with temperature in spring. CO<sub>2</sub> was accumulated from local sources under calm conditions (< 2\u00a0m\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>) and derived from remote sources at high wind speeds (> 4\u00a0m\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>), while O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were peaking at medium wind speeds of 2-4\u00a0m\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. CO<sub>2</sub> was found to derive from long-distance (short-distance transport) transport in spring (the other three seasons), whereas O<sub>3</sub> is mainly from long-distance (short-distance) transport in winter (the other three seasons). This work sheds light on the temporal characteristics of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, which has important implications for implementing practices to mitigate source emissions over cropland areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
