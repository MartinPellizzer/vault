Several priming methods enhance low temperature stress tolerant, however, the role of ozone priming remains unclear in wheat. Here we found ozone priming alleviated low temperature stress in wheat. Transcriptome analysis showed that ozone priming positively modulated 'photosynthesis-antenna proteins' pathway in wheat under low temperature. Which was confirmed by the results of the ozone-primed plants had higher trapped energy flux and electron transport flux per reaction, and less damage to chloroplasts than non-primed plants under low temperature. Ozone priming also mitigated the overstimulation of glutathione metabolism and induced the accumulation of total ascorbic acid and glutathione, maintained redox homeostasis in wheat under low temperature. Moreover, gene expressions and enzyme activities in glycolysis pathways were upregulated in ozone priming comparing with non-priming after the low temperature stress. Furthermore, exogenous antibiotics significantly increased low temperature tolerance, which further proved that the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis by ozone priming was involved in low temperature tolerance in wheat. In conclusion, ozone priming enhanced wheat low temperature tolerance through promoting light-harvesting capacity, redox homeostasis, and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as inhibiting ribosome biogenesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
