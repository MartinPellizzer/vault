However, the availability of short-lived \u00b7OH in aqueous bulk is low in practical treatment scenarios due to mass transfer limitations and quenching of water constituents. Herein, we overcome these challenges by loading MgO catalysts inside the pores of a tubular ceramic membrane (denoted as CCM) to confine \u00b7OH within the nanopores and achieve efficient pollutant removal. When the pore size of the membrane was reduced from 1000 to 50\u00a0nm, the removal of ibuprofen (IBU) by CCM was increased from 49.6\u00a0% to 90.2\u00a0% due to the enhancement of \u00b7OH enrichment in the nanospace. In addition, the CCM exhibited high catalytic activity in the presence of co-existing ions and over a wide pH range, as well as good self-cleaning ability in treating secondary wastewater. The experimental results revealed that \u00b7OH were the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollutant degradation, while surface hydroxyl groups were active sites for the generation of \u00b7OH via ozone decomposition. This work provides a promising strategy to enhance the utilization of \u00b7OH in HCO for the efficient degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater under spatial confinement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
