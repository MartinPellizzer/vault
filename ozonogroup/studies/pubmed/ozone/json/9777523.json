Three models of bacterial contamination were used. These were exposed to ozone generation in a standard hospital side-room for 4 and 7 h. A methicillin-sensitive and a methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus were compared. Ozone concentrations of 0.14 ppm were reached, levels which are sufficient to cause mild pulmonary toxicity. Bacterial counts were reduced in the vicinity of the gas generator in most instances, but the effect elsewhere in the room was, at best, limited. MRSA appeared more resistant to the effects of ozone than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. We conclude that the device tested would be inadequate for the decontamination of such hospital side-rooms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berrington", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedler", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Hosp Infect", "NlmUniqueID": "8007166", "ISSNLinking": "0195-6701"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cross Infection"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methicillin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcal Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9777523", "10.1016/s0195-6701(98)90026-3", "S0195-6701(98)90026-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
