The transformation characteristics of DOM were evaluated by gel filtration chromatography (GFC), XAD-8 resin fractionation, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Compared with O<sub>3</sub>-alone process, the removal efficiencies of COD, TOC, and color were improved in O<sub>3</sub>-combined processes (i.e., O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/UV) approximately by 10-15%, 7-15%, and 15-20%, respectively. Humic acid (HA) was completely degraded and preferentially reacted with the oxidants during ozonation processes. HA was first converted into fulvic acid (FA), and then the majority of these intermediates were further converted to hydrophilic fraction (HyI). The GFC results indicated that the broader molecular weight distribution of DOM was observed, and high molecular weight DOM (i.e., 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm-100\u00a0kDa) was successfully converted to low molecular weight organics in the range of 1-10\u00a0kDa after ozonation reactions. The EEM spectra also showed that HA and FA were effectively converted into HyI after ozonation for 90\u00a0min. It is suggested that ozone-based oxidation processes could effectively change the DOM distribution and fluorescence features of concentrated leachate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
