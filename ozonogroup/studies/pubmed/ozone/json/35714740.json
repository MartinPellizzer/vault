Bromide is one of the most abundant ions in seawater, the primary precursor of bromate during ozonation, and the end product in microbial bromate reduction. Investigations were carried out to compare the concentration of bromide in wastewater in coastal and non-coastal catchment areas, to monitor bromate formation during ozonation, and to assess the potential for subsequent bromate reduction with denitrifying carriers. Higher bromide concentrations were systematically observed in wastewater from coastal catchment areas (0.2-2 mg Br<sup>-</sup>/L) than in wastewater from non-coastal areas (0.06-0.2 mg Br<sup>-</sup>/L), resulting in elevated formation of bromate during ozonation. Subsequent investigations of bromate reduction in contact with denitrifying carriers from two full-scale moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) showed that 80 % of the bromate formed during ozonation could be reduced to bromide in 60 min with first-order rate constants of 0.3-0.8 L/(g<sub>biomass</sub>\u00b7h). Flow-through experiments with denitrifying carriers also showed that combined reduction of bromate and nitrate could be achieved below a concentration of 2 mg NO<sub>x</sub><sup>-</sup>-N/L. These findings indicate that bromide-rich wastewater is more likely to be of concern when using ozonation in coastal than in non-coastal areas, and that bromate and nitrate reduction can be combined in a single biofilm reactor."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
