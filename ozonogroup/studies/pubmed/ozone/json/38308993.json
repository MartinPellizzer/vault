Results show that China's overall anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in 2022 were around 1593.1 (1508.7-1680.7) GgN, about 47.0 %, 27.0 %, 13.4 %, 4.9 %, and 7.7 % of which were caused by agriculture, industry, energy utilization, wastewater, and indirect sources, respectively. Maximum reduction rate for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agriculture, industry, energy utilization, wastewater, and indirect sources can achieve 69 %, 99 %, 79 %, 86 %, and 48 %, respectively, in 2022. However, given current global scenarios with a rapidly changing population and geopolitical and energy tension, the emission reduction may not be fully fulfilled. Without compromising yields, China's theoretical minimum anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions would be 600.6 (568.8-633.6) GgN. In terms of the economic costs for reducing one kg of N<sub>2</sub>O-N emissions, the price ranged from \u20ac12.9 to \u20ac81.1 for agriculture, from \u20ac0.08 to \u20ac0.16 for industry, and from \u20ac104.8 to \u20ac1571.5 for energy utilization. We acknowledge the emission reduction rates may not be completely realistic for large-scale application in China. The social benefits gained from reducing one kg of N<sub>2</sub>O-N emissions in China was about \u20ac5.2, indicating anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions caused a loss 0.03 % of China's GDP, but only justifying reduction in industrial N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from the economic perspective. We perceive that the present monetized values will be trustworthy for at least three to five years, but later the numerical monetized values need to be considered in inflation and other currency-dependent conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
