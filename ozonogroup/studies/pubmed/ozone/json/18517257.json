Here, integrated transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics approaches were applied to investigate the molecular responses of O(3) in the leaves of 2-week-old rice (cv. Nipponbare) seedlings exposed to 0.2 ppm O(3) for a period of 24 h. On the basis of the morphological alteration of O(3)-exposed rice leaves, transcript profiling of rice genes was performed in leaves exposed for 1, 12, and 24 h using rice DNA microarray chip. A total of 1535 nonredundant genes showed altered expression of more than 5-fold over the control, representing 8 main functional categories. Genes involved in information storage and processing (10%) and cellular processing and signaling categories (24%) were highly represented within 1 h of O(3) treatment; transcriptional factor and signal transduction, respectively, were the main subcategories. Genes categorized into information storage and processing (17, 23%), cellular processing and signaling (20, 16%) and metabolism (18, 19%) were mainly regulated at 12 and 24 h; their main subcategories were ribosomal protein, post-translational modification, and signal transduction and secondary metabolites biosynthesis, respectively. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics analyses in combination with tandem mass spectrometer identified 23 differentially expressed protein spots (21 nonredundant proteins) in leaves exposed to O(3) for 24 h compared to respective control. Identified proteins were found to be involved in cellular processing and signaling (32%), photosynthesis (19%), and defense (14%). Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling revealed accumulation of amino acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutathione in O(3) exposed leaves until 24 h over control. This systematic survey showed that O(3) triggers a chain reaction of altered gene, protein and metabolite expressions involved in multiple cellular processes in rice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Biology Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Kyoungwon", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibato", "ForeName": "Junko", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Ganesh Kumar", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Young-Ho", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jwa", "ForeName": "Nam-Soo", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tamogami", "ForeName": "Shigeru", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satoh", "ForeName": "Kouji", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kikuchi", "ForeName": "Shoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higashi", "ForeName": "Tetsuji", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "Shinzo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saji", "ForeName": "Hikaru", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Yoshihide", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwahashi", "ForeName": "Hitoshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masuo", "ForeName": "Yoshinori", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rakwal", "ForeName": "Randeep", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Proteome Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101128775", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18517257", "10.1021/pr800128q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
