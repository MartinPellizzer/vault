'New Yorker' plants were exposed to O(3) to compare leaf diffusive conductance (LDC) before exposure to O(3) with O(3) sorption rates and visible injury ratings. Two plant development stages and four or five leaf growth stages were examined. The LDC varied among leaf growth stages and between plant development stages and leaf surfaces; there was no continuity in the LDC pattern. Sorption rates differed among some leaf growth stages, and between plant development stages in expanding leaves (growth stage 1). For both development stages high sorption rates occurred in fully mature leaves; otherwise little similarity between corresponding leaf growth stages was evident. Total O(3) flux to the leaf was not well predicted by the LDC for water vapour; nor was visible injury well related to total flux. Differential mesophyll processes and leaf surface sorption capabilities may have accounted for some of the inconsistencies observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ormrod", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092432", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90065-1", "0269749189900651"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
