The circuit consisted of a pair of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) in series, one OFET with and one without this treatment. In contrast to most previous OFET sensors, the readout was obtained from the voltage <i>V</i><sub>out</sub> at a point between the OFETs. The circuit showed a low detection limit (200 ppb) toward NO<sub>2</sub> and greatly reduced the voltage drift in the humid environment compared to the current drift of the circuit or the individual OFETs because of the balance of conductance drifts on either side of the readout point, which differs from the existing OFET-based sensors. By using <i>V</i><sub>out</sub> as the detection parameter, the sensitivity of the circuit approaches 25 and 400% for NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 200 ppb and 20 ppm, respectively. Moreover, the <i>V</i><sub>out</sub> is substantial enough to be easily measured by a voltmeter, which could remove the need for complex equipment (semiconductor analyzer system) for the sensing test. We thus demonstrate a simplified approach to stabilized OFET circuits that could be used in printable, flexible, or wearable sensors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Whiting School of Engineering , Johns Hopkins University , 3400 North Charles Street , Baltimore , Maryland 21218 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information , University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) , Chengdu 610054 , P.
