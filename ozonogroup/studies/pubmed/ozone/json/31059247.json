Second-order rate constants for the reactions of the six MCs with O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH ( k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>,MC</sub> and k<sub><sup>\u2022</sup>OH,MC</sub>) ranged from 7.1 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> to 6.1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> ( k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>,MC</sub>) and from 1.2 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> to 1.8 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> ( k<sub><sup>\u2022</sup>OH,MC</sub>), at pH 7.2 and 20 \u00b0C. The activation energies were calculated to be 21.6-34.5 and 11.6-13.1 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>,MC</sub> and k<sub><sup>\u2022</sup>OH,MC</sub>, respectively. The rate constants did not show an important pH dependency, except for k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>,MC-YR</sub>, which increased at pH > 7. A kinetic model using the determined rate constants and the measured exposures of O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH was able to precisely predict the removal of MCs in natural water. The hepatotoxicities of MCs were decreased by ozonation; the toxicities of the four MCs (MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-LA, and MC-LF) decreased nearly concurrently with decreases in their concentrations. However, MC-YR and MC-LW showed a gap between the concentration and toxicity as a result of the incomplete destruction of the Adda moiety (a key amino acid expressing the hepatotoxicity of MCs). A product study using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified a number of oxidation products with an intact Adda moiety produced by the ozonation of MC-YR and MC-LW."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process (ICP) , Seoul National University , 1 Gwanak-ro , Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826 , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Min Sik", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process (ICP) , Seoul National University , 1 Gwanak-ro , Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826 , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0404-9405"], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Changha", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31059247", "10.1021/acs.est.8b06645"]}}]}
