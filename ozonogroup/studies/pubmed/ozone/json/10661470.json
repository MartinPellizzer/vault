First, unlike isolated membranes, in which lipid modifications can be initiated by low ozone doses (< 0.5 micromol O3/mg protein) and develop proportionally to the treatment dose, in intact yeast cells, even the most ozone-sensitive sterols and nitrogen-containing phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) did not undergo oxidative destruction at doses up to 6.0 micromol O3/mg protein. Second, the peculiarity of the ozone-initiated lipid modification in intact cells was that different classes of lipids exhibited different sensitivity to ozone. With an increase in the ozone dose, neutral lipids (sterols) and nitrogen-containing phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin) were modified to a greater extent. Third, the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products upon ozone treatment of cells, in contrast to the isolated membranes, was absent at low ozone doses and was recorded only after the lethal damage. It is suggested that these differences are related to both the function of antioxidative enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, etc.) and the difference between the structural states (i.e., stability and accessibility to oxidation) of lipids in the isolated membranes and the intact cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Photobiology, Belorussian Academy of Science, Minsk."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matus", "ForeName": "V K", "Initials": "VK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martynova", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skorynko", "ForeName": "E V", "Initials": "EV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melnikova", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konev", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Membr Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9517472", "ISSNLinking": "1023-6597"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10661470"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
