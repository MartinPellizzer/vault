The pollution characteristics of VOCs in these functional areas during the heating and non-heating periods were analyzed, and the ozone formation potential(OFP) was estimated by using maximum incremental reactivity(MIR). The results show that the average mass concentration of VOCs is(82.19\u00b154.99) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in Shenyang, of which the concentration in industrial areas is significantly higher than that in traffic and cultural and educational mixed areas, and the heating period is higher. The traffic and mixed cultural and educational areas have bi-modal characteristics due to the morning and evening traffic, and the industrial area has multiple peaks affected by the irregular operation hours. The proportion of VOCs in traffic and mixed cultural and educational areas shows the order of alkanes>aromatic hydrocarbons>alkenes>alkynes, but the proportion of alkynes in industrial areas is higher than that of alkenes. The benzene to toluene(B/T) and ethane to acetylene(E/A) ratios reflects that traffic and mixed cultural and educational areas were affected by both vehicle exhaust emissions and fuel combustion. The industrial zone is therefore affected by complex sources, and there are more aged air masses during the heating period than non-heating period. The average OFP contribution of atmospheric VOCs in Shenyang is 232.89 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The contribution of alkenes is largest for all functional areas, and the aromatic component also contributes more due to the high concentration of industrial areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center of Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110000, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Wan-Hui", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center of Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110000, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Cong-Cong", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xing-Na", "Initials": "XN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34708959", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202101137"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
