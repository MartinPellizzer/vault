This study investigated the association between ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), a sensitive marker of ovarian reserve, in reproductive-aged Chinese women. We enrolled 2212 women with spontaneous menstrual cycles who underwent AMH measurements at a reproductive medicine center between 2018 and 2021. The daily mean concentrations of outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were estimated using a validated spatiotemporal model, followed by matching the participants' residential addresses. Three exposure periods were designed according to AMH expression patterns during follicle development. A generalized linear model was used to investigate changes in AMH associated with air pollution. The results showed a mean AMH level of 3.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.61\u00a0ng/mL. During the six months from primary to early antral follicle stage (Period 1), each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated with AMH changes of -0.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.48, 0.06) ng/mL and -0.31 (95% CI: -0.50, -0.12) ng/mL, respectively. Further analyses indicated that the reduced ovarian reserve measured by AMH level was only significantly associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during follicle development from the primary to preantral follicle stage (Period 2) but was significantly associated with O<sub>3</sub> exposure during Periods 1, 2, and 3. These observations were robust in the dual-pollutant model considering co-exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. The results indicated an inverse association between ovarian reserve and ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposure and suggested distinct susceptibility windows for O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> for reduced ovarian reserve. These findings highlight the need to control ambient air pollution to reduce invisible risks to women's fertility, especially at high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
