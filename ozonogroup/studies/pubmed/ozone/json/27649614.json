Percent caries reduction was studied in these initially healthy molars with complete occlusal eruption: 173 (control), 103 (varnish), 78 (sealants) and 103 (ozone) premolars met inclusion criteria. All patients were examined using DMFT index and Greene - Vermillion index at a baseline and in 6 months with a follow up period of 12 months. Each tooth was considered as the unit of the analysis. Data were analyzed using t-test and the chi-square tests.", "The prevalence of caries was: in group 1 - 3.5% (n=6), in group 2 and group 3\u00a0- 0% (n=0), in group 4 - 2.9%, (n=3).
