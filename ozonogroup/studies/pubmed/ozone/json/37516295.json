More importantly, how the aging process of nanoplastics affects the joint toxic potential of nanoplastics and antibiotics has not been explored. Here, we generated two aged polystyrene nanoplastics (PS) by UV radiation (UV-PS) and ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>-PS). Non-teratogenic concentrations of pristine PS (80\u00a0nm) and antibiotics penicillin (PNC) co-exposure synergistically suppressed the embryo heart beating and behaviors of spontaneous movement, touch response, and larval swimming behavioral response. Pristine PS and aged UV-PS, but not aged O<sub>3</sub>-PS, showed similar effects on zebrafish embryo/larval neurodevelopment. However, when co-exposure with PNC, both aged PS, but not pristine PS, showed antagonistic effects. In late-stage juvenile social behavior testing, we found that PS decreased the exploration in light/dark preference assay. The synergistic effect of aged PS with PNC was further explored, including cellular apoptosis, ROS formation, and neurotransmitter metabolite regulation. Mechanistically, aged UV-PS but not O<sub>3</sub>-PS significantly increased the adsorption rate of PNC compared to pristine PS, which may account for the toxicity difference between the two aged PS. In conclusion, our results confirmed that PS served as a carrier for PNC, and the environmental aging process changed their neurobehavioral toxicity pattern in vivo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
