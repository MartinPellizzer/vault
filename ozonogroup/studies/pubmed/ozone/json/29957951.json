Research has typically focused on the release and control of VOCs from hydrocarbon processing; however, agricultural activities, such as poultry production, can also be VOC sources and potentially contribute to ozone pollution. Therefore, this study examines the emission of C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> VOCs from poultry houses and the use of a vegetative environmental buffer (VEB) as a potential mitigation strategy. Sampling campaigns were conducted at two farms, one with and one without a VEB. Of the nine compounds measured, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were the primary VOCs emitted and had the largest ozone-formation potential (OFP). A significantly larger decrease in the OFP for methanol as a function of distance from the poultry house was observed at the farm with the VEB as compared with at the farm without the VEB. These results suggest that besides being a visual barrier and particulate screen, VEBs can provide some control of VOCs emitted from poultry production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , University of Maryland , 1173 Glenn L.
