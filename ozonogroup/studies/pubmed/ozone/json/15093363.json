Exposure of one-year-old foliage to twice ambient ozone (2 x AMB) resulted in significant decreases in net photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (gsw) and pigmentation relative to charcoal-filtered (CF) and ambient (AMB) ozone treatments. Ozone effects on gas exchange and pigmentation were most pronounced during late-season and differed significantly among clones. Environmental parameters (e.g. light, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature) accounted for more variation in Pn than did cumulative ozone exposure. Minimal differences in gsw and Pn among ozone treatments occurred during seasonal periods of high temperature and evaporative demand. Negative effects of 2 x AMB ozone on gsw and pigmentation were greatest for the clones having highest and lowest phenotypic vigor under ambient conditions; the clone of moderate phenotypic vigor under ambient conditions was least sensitive to ozone. Application of simulated acid rain of pH 3.0, pH 5.1 or no rain (NR) had little impact on gas exchange or pigmentation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Forestry Sciences Laboratory, Rhinelander, Wisconsin, USA. pdanders@newnorth.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Houpis", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Helms", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Momen", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093363", "10.1016/s0269-7491(97)00093-6", "S0269-7491(97)00093-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
