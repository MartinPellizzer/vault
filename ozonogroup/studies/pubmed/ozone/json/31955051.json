Firstly, an experimental campaign to evaluate the effect of recycled aggregate on mechanical properties was developed. The mixture designs studied were: a reference concrete (without recycled aggregate), two concretes with 20% and 100% replacement of coarse natural aggregate by recycled concrete aggregate; and three concretes with 20, 50 and 100% replacement of coarse natural aggregate by mixed recycled aggregate. To analyze their technical feasibility, these concretes were made in the laboratory and in a concrete plant. The economic viability was also studied indicating the additional costs incurred due to the utilization of recycled aggregate in different economic scenarios. Finally, the differences in environmental impacts were analyzed for each concrete. For this purpose, energy consumption, global warming, eutrophication, acidification, photochemical ozone creation, waste generation, and abiotic depletion were accounted. 20% replacement of recycled concrete aggregates does not cause practically variations in the cost or the environmental loads, only a reduction of waste generation and abiotic depletion of 8% and 10.6% respectively. In contrast, the use of 100% replacement by mixed aggregates may increase the global warming indicator an 11% when double transport distance is assumed. But in exchange, the waste generation decreases 35% and the abiotic depletion 50%. Aggregate transport distance is a key factor that will determine the cost, energy consumption, and global warming of the mixed recycled aggregate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
