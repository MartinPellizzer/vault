The non-radical oxidation driven by iron-based materials is noted for its environmental friendliness and resistance to wastewater matrix, and it is a promising approach for practical wastewater treatment. However, the complexity of heterogeneous systems and the diversity of evolutionary pathways make the mechanisms of non-radical oxidation driven by iron-based materials elusive. This work provides a systematic review of various non-radical oxidation systems driven by iron-based materials, including singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), reactive iron species (RFeS), and interfacial electron transfer. The unique mechanisms by which iron-based materials activate different oxidants (ozone, hydrogen peroxide, persulfate, periodate, and peracetic acid) to produce non-radical oxidation are described. The roles of active sites and the unique structures of iron-based materials in facilitating non-radical oxidation are discussed. Commonly employed identification methods in wastewater treatment are compared, such as quenching, chemical probes, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and electrochemical testing. According to the process of iron-based materials driving non-radical oxidation to remove organic pollutants, the driving factors at different stages are summarized. Finally, challenges and countermeasures are proposed in terms of mechanism exploration, detection methods and practical applications of non-radical oxidation driven by iron-based materials. This work provides valuable insights for understanding and developing non-radical oxidation systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
