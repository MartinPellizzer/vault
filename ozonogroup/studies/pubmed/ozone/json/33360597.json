Two aerosol formation pathways were identified during the EP, the first being the condensation of semi- and intermediate volatility oxidation products of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) under stagnant synoptic flow conditions, high temperatures and afternoon sea-breeze circulation. While this first pathway was prevalent, the most abundant organic aerosol factor was less oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol or LO-OOA. The second formation pathway occurred during a period of more persistent (synoptic) on-shore flow transporting more aged aerosol which consisted of an internal mixture of more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfate. It was estimated that 35% of the sulfate observed during the mature period (an average of about 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) originated from oceanic dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emissions. These two formation pathways helped elucidate the sources of fine particle pollution, highlighted the interaction between human emissions and natural DMS emission, and will help our understanding of pollution affecting other urban areas adjacent to large bodies of water during hot and stagnant periods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
