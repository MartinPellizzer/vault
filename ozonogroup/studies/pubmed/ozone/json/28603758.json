Here, in this data article a bone-char (BC) ash decorated with MgO-FeNO<sub>3</sub> for removing reactive black 5 (RB5) dye in a catalytic ozonation process (COP) system. Operational parameters data such as initial RB5 concentration, pH, catalyst dosage, and reaction time were optimized using Taguchi method. The optimal conditions for initial RB5 concentration, pH, catalyst dosage, and reaction time were determined 10\u00a0mg/L, 10, 0.1\u00a0g/L, and 15\u00a0min, respectively. Data of Taguchi optimization tests indicated that the initial RB5 concentration had a significant influence on RB5 removal efficiency (54.03%) during the catalytic ozonation process, and reaction time had lower contribution (2.04%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Social Determinants of Health Research Center (SDHRC), Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asgari", "ForeName": "Ghorban", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akbari", "ForeName": "Somaye", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Social Determinants of Health Research Center (SDHRC), Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Abdol Motaleb Seid", "Initials": "AMS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Poormohammadi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Engineering Department, Faculty of Health and Nutrition, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramavandi", "ForeName": "Bahman", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Asgari G., Seid Mohammadi A., Mortazavi S.B., Ramavandi B.
