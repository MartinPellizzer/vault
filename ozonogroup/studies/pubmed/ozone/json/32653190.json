Isoprene mixing ratios were larger in summer due to much stronger local emissions whereas monoterpenes were lower in summer due largely to their consumption by much higher levels of ozone. Isoprene mixing ratios were the highest at the 32\u00a0m in summer (1.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66\u00a0ppbV) and at 15\u00a0m in winter (1.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.64\u00a0ppbV) with decreasing concentrations to the ground and to the 102\u00a0m, indicating emission from the tree canopy of the surrounding parks. Monoterpene mixing ratios were the highest at the 3\u00a0m height in both the winter (0.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\u00a0ppbV) and summer (0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0ppbV) with a gradual decreasing trend to 102\u00a0m, indicting an emission from near the ground level. The lowest isoprene and monoterpene mixing ratios all occurred at 102\u00a0m, which were 0.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\u00a0ppbV (winter) and 1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51\u00a0ppbV (summer) for isoprene, and 0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0ppbV (winter) and 0.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0ppbV (summer) for monoterpenes. Isoprene in the summer and monoterpenes in the winter, as observed at the five heights, showed significant mutual correlations. In the winter monoterpenes were positively correlated with combustion tracers CO and acetonitrile at 3\u00a0m, suggesting possible anthropogenic sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
