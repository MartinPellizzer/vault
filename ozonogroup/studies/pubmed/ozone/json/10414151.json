Additionally the intensity of UV-radiation is influenced by other factors like aerosols, cloudiness and ozone. In higher altitudes there is an additional enhancement by reflection of snow. The most important consequences of the UV-radiation for the population are, however, relevant in spring and summer time during the bathing season and during the late winter season for ski tourists. On a day with a clear sky in summer the UV-radiation can reach maximum values for UV-A of 45 W/m2 and for UV-B of 0.175 W/m2. The ratio of UV-A/UV-B shows an annual course with a maximum in winter of about 500 and a minimum of about 220 in summer. The possible effects on health by extensive UV-exposition are photoageing, skin cancer, inflammation processes and cataract. In Switzerland about 5000 new melanoma cases in men and about 4000 in women occur per year. In contrast to other environmental factors like pollen UV-radiation has the big advantage that the personal exposition can be controlled. Therefore, it is very essential that the general rules of a judicious behaviour such as avoiding the sun at noon, always wearing a hat, shirt and trousers as well as sunglasses with UV-filter are often reiterated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Schweizerische Meteorologische Anstalt, Z\u00fcrich."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frei", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dummer", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gehrig", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Die-UV-Belastung in der Schweiz: Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von Ort und Zeit und ihre Bedeutung f\u00fcr die Haut."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Praxis (Bern 1994)", "NlmUniqueID": "101468093", "ISSNLinking": "1661-8157"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation, Ionizing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Topography, Medical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10414151"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
