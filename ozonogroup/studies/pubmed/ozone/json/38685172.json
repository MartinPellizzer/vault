Despite its high usage, reported PPZ concentrations in environmental water samples are comparatively low, which can be explained by the extensive metabolism of PPZ in the human body. Since most previous studies did not consider human PPZ metabolites it can be assumed that the current environmental exposure associated with the application of PPZ is substantially underestimated. In our study, 4'-O-demethyl-PPZ sulfide (M1) was identified as the predominant PPZ metabolite by analyzing urine of a PPZ consumer as well as the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). M1 was found to be ubiquitously present in WWTP effluents (max. concentration: 3\u2009000 ng/L) and surface waters in Germany. On average, the surface water concentrations of M1 were approximately 30 times higher than those of the parent compound PPZ. Laboratory scale experiments demonstrated that activated carbon can considerably adsorb M1 und thus improve its removal during wastewater and drinking water treatment. Laboratory ozonation experiments showed a fast oxidation of M1, accompanied by the formation of several ozonation products. Certain ozonation products (identities confirmed via synthesized reference standards) were also detected in water samples collected after ozonation in a full-scale WWTP. Overall lower signal intensities were observed in the effluents of a sand filter and biologically active granular activated carbon filter, suggesting that the compounds were significantly removed during these post-ozonation treatment stages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
