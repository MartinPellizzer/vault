A total of 1376 participants who were seropositive for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) or had abnormal liver function in a community screening program from 2019 to 2021 were enrolled for the assessment of liver fibrosis using transient elastography. Daily estimates of air pollutants (particulate matter \u22642.5\u2009\u03bcm in diameter [PM<sub>2.5</sub> ], nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub> ], ozone [O<sub>3</sub> ] and benzene) were aggregated into mean estimates for the previous year based on the date of enrolment. Of the 1376 participants, 767 (52.8%) and 187 (13.6) had MAFLD and advanced fibrosis, respectively. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors associated with advanced liver fibrosis were HCV viremia (odds ratio [OR], 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.05-4.77; p\u2009<\u20090.001), smoking (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.16-2.74; p\u2009=\u20090.01), age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Linear regression analysis revealed that LSM was independently correlated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> (\u03b2: 0.134; 95% CI: 0.025, 0.243; p\u2009=\u20090.02). There was a dose-dependent relationship between different fibrotic stages and the PM<sub>2.5</sub> level (the PM<sub>2.5</sub> level in patients with fibrotic stages 0, 1-2 and 3-4: 27.9, 28.4, and 29.3\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> , respectively; trend p\u2009<\u20090.001). Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> , as well as HBV and HCV infections, is associated with advanced liver fibrosis in patients with MAFLD. There was a dose-dependent correlation between PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels and the severity of hepatic fibrosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Authors.
