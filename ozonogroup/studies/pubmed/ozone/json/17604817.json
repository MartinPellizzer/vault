However, no appropriate technology has been devised for treating HMDS in gas streams. This investigation evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of the UV (185+254nm) and UV (254nm)/O(3) processes for degradation of gaseous HMDS. Tests were performed in two batch reactors with initial HMDS concentrations of 32-41mgm(-3) under various initial ozone dosages (O(3) (mg)/HMDS (mg)=1-5), atmospheres (N(2), O(2), and air), temperatures (28, 46, 65 and 80 degrees C), relative humilities (20%, 50%, 65%, 99%) and volumetric UV power inputs (0.87, 1.74, 4.07 and 8.16Wl(-1)) to assess their effects on the HMDS degradation rate. Results indicate that for all conditions, the decomposition rates for the UV (185+254nm) irradiation exceeded those for the UV (254nm)/O(3) process. UV (185+254nm) decompositions of HMDS displayed an apparent first-order kinetics. A process with irradiation of UV (185+254nm) to HMDS in air saturated with water at temperatures of 46-80 degrees C favors the HMDS degradation. With the condition as above and a P/V of around 8Wl(-1), k was approximately 0.20s(-1) and a reaction time of just 12s was required to degrade over 90% of the initial HMDS. The main mechanisms for the HMDS in wet air streams irradiated with UV (185+254nm) were found to be caused by OH free-radical oxidation produced from photolysis of water or O((1)D) produced from photolysis of oxygen. The economic evaluation factors of UV (185+254nm) and UV (254nm)/O(3) processes at different UV power inputs were also estimated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, 70 Lien-hai Road, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan, ROC. ms.chou@msa.hinet.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "Ming-Shean", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Ken-Lin", "Initials": "KL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organosilicon Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H36C68P1BH", "NameOfSubstance": "hexamethylsilazane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organosilicon Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17604817", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.05.040", "S0045-6535(07)00680-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
