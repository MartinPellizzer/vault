Ozone may be used as an antimicrobial agent to control the decay. The effect of gaseous ozone on spore viability of B. cinerea and mycelial growth of B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum were investigated. Spore viability of B. cinerea was reduced by over 99.5% (P < 0.01) and height of the aerial mycelium was reduced from 4.7 mm in the control to less than 1 mm after exposure to 450 or 600 ppb ozone for 48 h at 20 degrees C. Sporulation of B. cinerea was also substantially inhibited by ozone treatments. However, ozone had no significant effect on mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum in vitro. Decay and quality parameters including color, chlorophyll fluorescence (CF), and ozone injury were further assessed for various horticultural commodities (apple, grape, highbush blueberry, and carrot) treated with 450 ppb of ozone for 48 h at 20 degrees C over a period of 12 d. Lesion size and height of the aerial mycelium were significantly reduced by the ozone treatment on carrots inoculated with mycelial agar plugs of B. cinerea or S. sclerotiorum. Lesion size was also reduced on treated apples inoculated with 5 x 10(6) spores/mL of B. cinerea, and decay incidence of treated grapes was reduced. The 450 ppb ozone for 48 h treatment had no significant effect on color of carrots and apples or on CF of apples and grapes. Ozone, an environmentally sound antimicrobial agent, inactivates microorganisms through oxidization and residual ozone spontaneously decomposes to nontoxic products. It may be applied to fruits and vegetables to reduce decay and extend shelf life."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Dept., Mount Saint Vincent Univ., Halifax, NS, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharpe", "ForeName": "Deana", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McRae", "ForeName": "Ken", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "Brad", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "MacKay", "ForeName": "Ron", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doucette", "ForeName": "Craig", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0014052", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blueberry Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Botrytis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Daucus carota"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Malus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mycelium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pigmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Spores, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19723209", "10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01234.x", "JFDS1234"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
