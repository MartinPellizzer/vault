The destructive character of ROS was observed among others during interaction of cereal grains with ozone and was caused by changes in structures of biomolecules leading to the formation of stable organic radicals. That effect was more evident for stress sensitive genotypes. In this study we investigated the influence of UV irradiation on cereal grains originating from genotypes with different tolerance to oxidative stress.", "Grains and their parts (endosperm, embryo and seed coat) of barley, wheat and oat were subjected to short-term UV irradiation. It was found that UV caused the appearance of various kinds of reactive species (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-\u2022</sup> , H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) and stable radicals (semiquinone, phenoxyl and carbon-centred). Simultaneously, lipid peroxidation occurred and the organic structure of Mn(II) and Fe(III) complexes become disturbed.", "UV irradiation causes damage of main biochemical structures of plant tissues, the effect is more significant in sensitive genotypes. In comparison with ozone treatment, UV irradiation leads to stronger destruction of biomolecules in grains and their parts. It is caused by the high energy of UV light, facilitating easier breakage of molecular bonds in biochemical compounds. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0136-3762"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kurdziel", "ForeName": "Magdalena", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Polish Academy of Sciences, The Franciszek G\u00f3rski Institute of Plant Physiology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "Filek", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "LastName": "\u0141abanowska", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Avena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29064559", "10.1002/jsfa.8753"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
