In this respect, the use of specific epidemiological methods has been crucial. Common outdoor pollutants are particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and ozone. Short-term effects of outdoor air pollution include changes in lung function, respiratory symptoms and mortality due to respiratory causes. Increase in the use of health care resources has also been associated with short-term effects of air pollution. Long-term effects of cumulated exposure to urban air pollution include lung growth impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and probably the development of asthma and allergies. Lung cancer and COPD have been related to a shorter life expectancy. Common indoor pollutants are environmental tobacco smoke, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and biological allergens. Concentrations of these pollutants can be many times higher indoors than outdoors. Indoor air pollution may increase the risk of irritation phenomena, allergic sensitisation, acute and chronic respiratory disorders and lung function impairment. Recent conservative estimates have shown that 1.5-2 million deaths per year worldwide could be attributed to indoor air pollution. Further epidemiological research is necessary to better evaluate the respiratory health effects of air pollution and to implement protective programmes for public health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EPAR, UMRS-S 707, Inserm Universit\u00e9 Pierre-et-Marie-Curie, Facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine Saint-Antoine, 27 rue Chaligny, 75571 Paris Cedex 12, France. annesi@u707.jussieu.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Annesi-Maesano", "ForeName": "Isabella", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dab", "ForeName": "William", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Pollution atmosph\u00e9rique et poumon: approche \u00e9pid\u00e9miologique."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Med Sci (Paris)", "NlmUniqueID": "8710980", "ISSNLinking": "0767-0974"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "NumberOfReferences": "31"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16828033", "10.1051/medsci/20062267589", "00/00/09/5B/"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
