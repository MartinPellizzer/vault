Drylands are characterized by extremely low levels of water and nutrients and exhibit highly heterogeneous distribution in plants and biocrusts which make microbial processes shaping the dryland functioning rather unique compared with other terrestrial ecosystems. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub> O) is a powerful greenhouse gas with ozone depletion potential. Despite of the pivotal influences of microbial communities on the production and consumption of N<sub>2</sub> O, we have limited knowledge of the biological pathways and mechanisms underpinning N<sub>2</sub> O emissions from drylands, which are estimated to account for 30% of total gaseous nitrogen emissions on Earth. In this article, we describe the key microbial players and biological pathways regulating dryland N<sub>2</sub> O emissions, and discuss how these processes will respond to emerging global changes such as climate warming, extreme weather events and nitrogen deposition. We also provide a conceptual framework to precisely manipulate the dryland microbiome to mitigate N<sub>2</sub> O emissions in situ using emerging technologies with great specificity and efficacy. These cross-disciplinary efforts will enable the development of novel and environmental-friendly microbiome-based solutions to future mitigation strategies of climate change."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, the University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Hang-Wei", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Trivedi", "ForeName": "Pankaj", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, the University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Ji-Zheng", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Penrith South DC, NSW, 2751, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Global Centre for Land-Based Innovation, Western Sydney University, Penrith South DC, NSW, 2751, Australia."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Brajesh K", "Initials": "BK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100883692", "ISSNLinking": "1462-2912"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Archaea"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbiota"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone Depletion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28493368", "10.1111/1462-2920.13795"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
