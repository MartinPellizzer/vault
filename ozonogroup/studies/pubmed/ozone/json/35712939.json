The propensity of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> to generate ozone and fine particulate matter and associated impacts on health are highly variable, whereas the climate impacts of long-lived N<sub>2</sub>O are independent of emission timing and location. However, these impacts have rarely been compared on a spatially resolved monetized basis. In this study, we update the nitrogen scheme in an agroecosystem model to simulate the Nr emissions from fertilized soils across the contiguous United States. We then apply a reduced-form air pollution health effect model to assess air quality impacts from NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> and a social cost of N<sub>2</sub>O to assess the climate impacts. Assuming an $8.2 million value of a statistical life and a $13,100/ton social cost of N<sub>2</sub>O, the air quality impacts are a factor of \u223c7 to 15 times as large as the climate impacts in heavily populated coastal regions, whereas the ratios are closer to 2.5 in sparsely populated regions. Our results show that air pollution, health, and climate should be considered jointly in future assessments of how farming practices affect Nr emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nature Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Greensboro, North Carolina 27401, United States."}], "LastName": "Ran", "ForeName": "Limei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6274-6236"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}], "LastName": "Rasool", "ForeName": "Quazi Z", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0415-7980"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Cohan", "ForeName": "Daniel S", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35712939", "10.1021/acs.est.1c08660"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
