The results show that the spatial distributions of air pollutants are generally circular near Guangzhou and Foshan, which are cities with high emissions rates. The primary pollutant is particulate matter (PM) over the PRD. MM5 shows reasonable performance for major meteorological variables (i.e., temperature, relative humidity, wind direction) with normalized mean biases (NMB) of 4.5-38.8% and for their time series. CMAQ can capture one peak of all air pollutant concentrations on October 11, but misses other peaks. The CMAQ model systematically underpredicts the mass concentrations of all air pollutants. Compared with chemical observations, SO2 and O3 are predicted well with a correlation coefficient of 0.70 and 0.65. PM2.5 and NO are significantly underpredicted with an NMB of 43% and 90%, respectively. The process analysis results show that the emission, dry deposition, horizontal transport, and vertical transport are four main processes affecting air pollutants. The contributions of each physical process are different for the various pollutants. The most important process for PM10 is dry deposition, and for NO(x) it is transport. The contributions of horizontal and vertical transport processes vary during the period, but these two processes mostly contribute to the removal of air pollutants at Guangzhou city, whose emissions are high. For this high-pressure case, the contributions of the various processes show high correlations in cities with the similar geographical attributes. According to the statistical results, cities in the PRD region are divided into four groups with different features. The contributions from local and nonlocal emission sources are discussed in different groups.", "The characteristics of aerosol pollution episodes are intensively studied in this work using the high-resolution modeling system MM5/SMOKE/CMAQ, with special efforts on examining the contributions of different physical and chemical processes to air concentrations for each city over the PRD region by a process analysis method, so as to provide a scientific basis for understanding the formation mechanism of regional aerosol pollution under the high-pressure system over PRD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Shaojia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xuemei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Delong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yerong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Pak-Wai", "Initials": "PW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24843912", "10.1080/10962247.2013.816387"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
