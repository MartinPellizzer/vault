Sesquiterpenes contribute 2.4% to the global carbon emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and can be responsible for up to 70% of the regional BVOC emissions. HOMs were detected with chemical ionization-atmospheric pressure interface-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and nitrate and acetate ionization. Acetate ions were more sensitive toward highly oxidized RO2 radicals containing a single hydroperoxide moiety. Under the chosen reaction conditions, product formation was dominated by highly oxidized RO2 radicals which react with NO, NO2, HO2, and other RO2 radicals under atmospheric conditions. The ozonolysis of sesquiterpenes resulted in molar HOM yields of 0.6% for \u03b1-cedrene (acetate), 1.8% for \u03b2-caryophyllene (acetate), and 1.4% for \u03b1-humulene (nitrate) afflicted with an uncertainty factor of 2. Molar yields of highly oxidized RO2 radicals were identical with HOM yields measuring the corresponding closed-shell products. HOM formation from ozonolysis of \u03b1-cedrene was explained by an autoxidation mechanism initiated by ozone attack at the double bond similar to that found in the ozonolysis of cyclohexene and limonene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , Permoserstra\u00dfe 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Richters", "ForeName": "Stefanie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , Permoserstra\u00dfe 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Herrmann", "ForeName": "Hartmut", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , Permoserstra\u00dfe 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Berndt", "ForeName": "Torsten", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-42-5", "NameOfSubstance": "cedrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54W56MD2WD", "NameOfSubstance": "humulene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BHW853AU9H", "NameOfSubstance": "caryophyllene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26830670", "10.1021/acs.est.5b05321"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
