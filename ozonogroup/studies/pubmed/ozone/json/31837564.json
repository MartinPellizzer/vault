In this study, the degradation kinetics of indigo carmine was investigated systematically, applying N<sub>2</sub>-NTP, O<sub>2</sub>-NTP, ozonolysis and hydrogen peroxide and the results were compared. The transient species (OH, O and NO radicals) formed with the NTP discharge at the gas-liquid interface and their products (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) stabilized by the water, were identified and quantified. These species contribute to the effects on the chemical characteristics of the water, such as a decrease in the pH and increase in the conductivity and redox potential. Additionally, the stabilization of the oxidative species was estimated from the degradation reactions induced by the post-discharge effect, which was significant in the case of N<sub>2</sub>-NTP, due to the presence of long-lived species, such as nitrite and nitrate. The kinetics study revealed first-order kinetics for IC color removal and the rate constant values followed the order: O<sub>2</sub>-NTP (3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>)\u00a0>\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> (1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>)\u00a0>\u00a0N<sub>2</sub>-NTP (2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>)\u00a0>\u00a0H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (negligible). Also the main by-products of N<sub>2</sub>-NTP, O<sub>2</sub>-NTP and ozonolysis degradation reaction were identified by ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The route fragmentation showed the formation of indole intermediates, such as isatin, which is an important precursor in organic synthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
