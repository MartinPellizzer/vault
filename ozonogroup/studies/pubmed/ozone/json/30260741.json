Epithelialization was evaluated by applying 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to the wound area and also measured by using digital image analysis (ImageJ). Bland-Altman plots were used for assessing agreement between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ImageJ measurements. Parameters in relation to patient morbidity were assessed by using visual analog scale (VAS) on the first 3, 7, 14, and 30 days postoperatively.", "At day 14, statistically significant smaller wounds were observed with digital image analysis in the ozone group as compared with the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.034). However, intergroup comparison of the remaining wound area evaluated by the clinician using the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> method did not reveal any significant differences (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Nonetheless, according to Bland-Altman analysis, the lower and upper limits showed a moderate agreement between the two measurement methods. The mean VAS sores exhibiting postoperative discomfort was observed to be significantly higher in the control group compared with the laser group (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and ozone group (p\u2009<\u20090.001) at day 7.", "Adjunctive ozone therapy could have a significantly beneficial effect on the acceleration of palatal wound healing following FGG procedures. Both PBM and ozone treatment modalities reduced postoperative discomfort as compared with spontaneous healing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Gazi University , Ankara, Turkey ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isler", "ForeName": "Sila Cagri", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Gazi University , Ankara, Turkey ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uraz", "ForeName": "Ahu", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Dumlup\u0131nar University , K\u00fctahya, Turkey ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guler", "ForeName": "Berceste", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Gazi University , Ankara, Turkey ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozdemir", "ForeName": "Yucel", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Insurance and Risk Management, Faculty of Commercial Sciences, Baskent University , Ankara, Turkey ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cula", "ForeName": "Serpil", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Gazi University , Ankara, Turkey ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cetiner", "ForeName": "Deniz", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photomed Laser Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101222340", "ISSNLinking": "1549-5418"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gingival Recession"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Low-Level Light Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["transplantation"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Palate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Re-Epithelialization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transplant Donor Site"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30260741", "10.1089/pho.2018.4492"]}}]}
