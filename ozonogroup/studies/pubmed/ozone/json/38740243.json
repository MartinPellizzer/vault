This study investigated the formation mechanisms of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in a suburban area with low anthropogenic emissions. The average PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 25.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> identified as the largest contributor. Ammonium-rich conditions prevailed throughout the study period, coupled with low atmospheric temperature facilitating the transfer of gaseous HNO<sub>3</sub> into the particulate phase. This result indicates that the formation of HNO<sub>3</sub> played a crucial role in determining particulate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration. Nocturnal increases in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were observed alongside increasing ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and relative humidity (RH), emphasizing the significance of heterogeneous reactions involving N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations at the study site were notably higher than in Seoul, the upwind metropolitan area, during a high concentration episode. This difference could potentially attributed to lower local NO concentrations, which enhanced the reaction between O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, to produce NO<sub>3</sub> radicals. High concentrations of Cl<sup>-</sup> and dust were also identified as contributors to the elevated NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
