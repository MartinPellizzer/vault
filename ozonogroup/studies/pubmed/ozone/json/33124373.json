The results showed that: 1 from 2013 to 2018, the comprehensive index of Baoding dropped from 11.6 to 6.6, the days of severe pollution decreased from 114 days to 27 days, and cumulative concentration of pollutants during severe pollution decreased from 57.34% to 20.59%. This indicated that the air quality of Baoding city has improved year on year from 2013 to 2018. Not only has the number of heavy pollution days and the annual average concentration of pollutants decreased, but also the proportion of cumulative concentrations of pollutants during heavy pollution has decreased. the difference between the average concentration level of Baoding city and \"2+26\" Cities is getting smaller and smaller. \u2461 Summer <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) increased year on year. In 2017 and 2018, the heavy pollution days caused by O<sub>3</sub> accounted for 17.0% and 14.8% of the heavy pollution days of the year, respectively, and the ozone pollution gradually became prominent; the characteristic value of NO<sub>2</sub> in autumn was higher than that of SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub>, indicating that the type of pollution in autumn was more motorized. The sources of pollution in winter changed from the partial combustion of coal in 2013-2014 to a mixed influence of partial combustion of coal and incomplete combustion in 2015-2018. \u2462 In 2016, 2017, and 2018, a high cumulative concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the high pollution season that accounted for 5.56%, 6.21%, and 2.58% declined as compared to that during the same period in 2015; this was the largest decline among the six pollutants; PM<sub>10</sub> followed; The decreases of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were small, indicating that the emergency measures were better in cutting peaks of particulate matter than the gaseous pollutants during heavy pollution in Baoding. In a heavy pollution event during the high pollution season in 2018, partial-burning coal-type pollution increased as compared to that during the high pollution season in 2017, indicating that the coal combustion was still one of the pollution sources that Baoding city needed to control. In summary, Baoding should strengthen the management and control of motor vehicles in autumn, and gradually change from the original coal control measures to a combination of coal control and diesel control in winter; in the future, the focus of air pollution prevention and control should be strengthened toward O<sub>3</sub> pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Gou", "ForeName": "Yin-Yin", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jin-Juan", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "L\u00dc", "ForeName": "Wen-Li", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baoding Environmental Monitoring Center of Hebei Province, Baoding 071000, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Shan-Shan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhi", "ForeName": "Min-Kang", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33124373", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201912193"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
