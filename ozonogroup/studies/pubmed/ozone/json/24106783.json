This study aimed at developing a novel zein-based biopolymer film with ice nucleation activity through layer-by-layer deposition of biogenic ice nucleators, that is, extracellular ice nucleators (ECINs) isolated from Erwinia herbicola , onto zein film surface. The adsorption behaviors and mechanisms were investigated using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). On unmodified zein surface, the highest ECINs adsorption occurred at pH 5.0; on UV/ozone treated zein surface followed by deposition of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) layer, the optimum condition for ECINs adsorption occurred at pH 7.0 and I 0.05 M, where the amount of ECINs adsorbed was also higher than that on unmodified zein surface. QCM-D analyses further revealed a two-step adsorption process on unmodified zein surfaces, compared to a one-step adsorption process on PDADMAC-modified zein surface. Also, significantly, in order to quantify the ice nucleation activity of ECINs-coated zein films, an empirical method was developed to correlate the number of ice nucleators with the ice nucleation temperature measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Calculated using this empirical method, the highest ice nucleation activity of ECINs on ECINs-modified zein film reached 64.1 units/mm(2), which was able to elevate the ice nucleation temperature of distilled water from -15.5 \u00b0C to -7.3 \u00b0C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Rutgers University , 65 Dudley, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hailong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Tung-Ching", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qingrong", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biodegradable Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biopolymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ice"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ice nucleation protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9010-66-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Zein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradable Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biopolymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Erwinia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24106783", "10.1021/am4016457"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
