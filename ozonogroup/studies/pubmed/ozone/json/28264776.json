To remove the toxic and refractory pollutants in SGDF and improve its biodegradability, a microsacle Fe<sup>0</sup>/Persulfate/O<sub>3</sub> process (mFe<sup>0</sup>/PS/O<sub>3</sub>) was developed to pretreat this wastewater obtained from a shale gas well in southwestern China. First, effects of mFe<sup>0</sup> dosage, O<sub>3</sub> flow rate, PS dosage, pH values on the treatment efficiency of mFe<sup>0</sup>/PS/O<sub>3</sub> process were investigated through single-factor experiments. Afterward, the optimal conditions (i.e., pH\u00a0=\u00a06.7, mFe<sup>0</sup> dosage\u00a0=\u00a06.74\u00a0g/L, PS\u00a0=\u00a016.89\u00a0mmol/L, O<sub>3</sub> flow rate\u00a0=\u00a00.73\u00a0L/min) were obtained by using response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimal conditions, high COD removal (75.3%) and BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD ratio (0.49) were obtained after 120\u00a0min treatment. Moreover, compared with control experiments (i.e., mFe<sup>0</sup>, O<sub>3</sub>, PS, mFe<sup>0</sup>/O<sub>3</sub>, mFe<sup>0</sup>/PS, O<sub>3</sub>/PS), mFe<sup>0</sup>/PS/O<sub>3</sub> system exerted better performance for pollutants removal in SGDF due to strong synergistic effect between mFe<sup>0</sup>, PS and O<sub>3</sub>. In addition, the decomposition or transformation of the organic pollutants in SGDF was analyzed by using GC-MS. Finally, the reaction mechanism of the mFe<sup>0</sup>/PS/O<sub>3</sub> process was proposed according to the analysis results of SEM-EDS and XRD. It can be concluded that high-efficient mFe<sup>0</sup>/PS/O<sub>3</sub> process was mainly resulted from the combination effect of direct oxidation by ozone and persulfate, heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic oxidation, Fenton-like reaction and adsorption. Therefore, mFe<sup>0</sup>/PS/O<sub>3</sub> process was proven to be an effective method for pretreatment of SGDF prior to biological treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
