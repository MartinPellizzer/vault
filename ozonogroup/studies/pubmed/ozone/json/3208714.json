The present study measured lipid breakdown products in lungs isolated from rats pretreated with [1-14C]acetate 12 h before exposure for 4 h to either air or 2 ppm ozone. Lipid fatty acid breakdown was indicated by a 112% increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances on ozone exposure and by changes in chemical and radioactive measurements of mono- and dicarboxylic acids formed by treatment of lipid fractions with hydrogen peroxide. Ozone exposure resulted in a 63% increase in recovery of short-chain fatty acids accounted for by increased recoveries of malonic acid by 37%, hexanoic acid by 47%, nonanoic acid by 118%, and azelaic acid by 107%. Recovery of glutaric acid was enhanced 15-fold by ozone exposure. Although decreases in tissue arachidonic acid could not be detected, oleic acid was significantly decreased by 36%. Recovery of radiolabel as short-chain fatty acids was increased by 65% on ozone exposure and was mainly accounted for by enhanced labeling of nonanoic and glutaric acid fractions. The failure to observe significant increases in 14C recovery in the other fractions suggested ozone-induced breakdown of unlabeled fatty acids. These results demonstrate the cleavage of unsaturated fatty acid double bonds following in vivo exposure of lungs to ozone. Breakdown of arachidonic and oleic acids was specifically identified by increased recoveries of glutaric and nonanoic acids, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterans Administration Hospital, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rabinowitz", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassett", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03505", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-34674", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dicarboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dicarboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3208714", "10.3109/01902148809087822"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
