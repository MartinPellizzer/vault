To date, research on vehicle IAQ has primarily focused on direct emissions as opposed to chemistry happening in vehicle cabins. In this work, we conducted time-resolved measurements of the oxidants and oxidant precursors ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and nitrous acid (HONO) inside the cabin of a 2012 Toyota Rav4 under varying ventilation conditions (<i>i.e.</i>, car off, car on with passive ventilation, car on with mechanical ventilation <i>via</i> the recirculating fan, and car on with mechanical ventilation <i>via</i> the direct fan). Ozone levels inside the vehicle were significantly lower than outdoors under most conditions, and were approximately half the outdoor levels when the direct fan was in operation. Nitric oxide and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were very low both inside the vehicle and outdoors. Nitrous acid levels in the vehicle were lower than reported values in other indoor environments, though much higher than expected outdoor levels. We also investigated the potential for photochemical production of radicals in the vehicle. Time- and wavelength-resolved solar irradiance spectra were collected, and steady state hydroxyl radical (OH) and nitrate radical (NO<sub>3</sub>) concentrations were calculated. Steady state OH concentrations were predicted to be similar to those in air masses in residences illuminated by sunlight, suggesting the importance of HONO photolysis in vehicles. Conversely, nitrate radicals (NO<sub>3</sub>) were not considered significant indoor oxidants in our study due to rapid titration by NO. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of both air exchange and photochemistry in shaping the composition of air inside vehicles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7680-0181"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada. tara.kahan@usask.ca."}], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Pedro A F", "Initials": "PAF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Kroptavich", "ForeName": "Corey R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5074-1155"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada. tara.kahan@usask.ca."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Kahan", "ForeName": "Tara F", "Initials": "TF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39058373", "10.1039/d4em00319e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
