The generation of the degradation products was interpreted in the context of transformations of effluent organic matter (EfOM) tracked via absorbance measurements. The structures of 20 degradation products were elucidated for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively. 27 degradation products were identified for lomefloxacin. The prevalent oxidation pathways were suggested based on the structures of the identified products formed in the absence and presence of the hydroxyl radical scavenger t-butanol. These pathways were largely similar for all studied fluoroquinolones and involved attacks on the piperazine ring and the quinolone structure. The quinolone ring remained intact in the presence of t-butanol thus indicating that this functional group could only be oxidized by OH radicals while the piperazine ring was readily oxidized by molecular ozone. The cleavage of the quinolone moiety that resulted in several identified degradation products occurred via the attack by hydroxyl radicals on the carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Lomefloxacin had more diverse oxidation products due to the presence of a methyl group on its piperazinyl ring. The concentrations of the identified degradation products behaved non-monotonically as a function of ozone dose or treatment time, yet exhibited interpretable correlations versus changes of EfOM absorbance. Examination of these correlations allowed developing a novel approach for elucidating the transformations of fluoroquinolone antibiotics during ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
