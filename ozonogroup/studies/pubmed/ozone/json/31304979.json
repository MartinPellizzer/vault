Although the association between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> ) and lung cancer has been recognized, there is less evidence for associations with other common air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ). Even less is known about potential associations between these pollutants and breast cancer. We conducted a population-based cohort study to investigate the associations of chronic exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> , NO<sub>2</sub> , O<sub>3</sub> and redox-weighted average of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>x</sub> ) with incident lung and breast cancer, using the Ontario Population Health and Environment Cohort (ONPHEC), which includes all long-term residents aged 35-85\u2009years who lived in Ontario, Canada, 2001-2015. Incident lung and breast cancers were ascertained using the Ontario Cancer Registry. Annual estimates of exposures were assigned to the residential postal codes of subjects for each year during follow-up. We used Cox proportional-hazards models adjusting for personal- and neighborhood-level covariates. Our cohorts for lung and breast cancer analyses included ~4.9 million individuals and ~2.5 million women, respectively. During follow-up, 100,146 incident cases of lung cancer and 91,146 incident cases of breast cancer were diagnosed. The fully adjusted analyses showed positive associations of lung cancer incidence with PM<sub>2.5</sub> (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02 [95% CI: 1.01-1.05] per 5.3\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> ) and NO<sub>2</sub> (HR = 1.05 [95% CI: 1.03-1.07] per 14\u2009ppb). No associations with lung cancer were observed for O<sub>3</sub> or O<sub>x</sub> . Relationships between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> with lung cancer exhibited a sublinear shape. We did not find compelling evidence linking air pollution to breast cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 UICC."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
