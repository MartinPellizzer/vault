Exposure to either 800 or 1200 ppb ozone for 6 h did not influence the content or activity of mouse lung ribosomal RNA; in consequence pulmonary protein synthesis pathways were not altered. 2. Increasing the exposure period to 24 h had a marked effect on protein metabolism which depended on the dose of ozone employed. A dose of 800 ppb resulted in a 17% increase in lung protein content. Since both lung ribosomal capacity and fractional synthesis rates were unchanged at this time, it is concluded that both a lower ribosomal activity and an increased protein degradation rate were responsible for the decrease in content. 3. Exposure to 1200 ppb ozone for 24 h, paradoxically resulted in increases in both the fractional (33%) and total (19%) protein synthetic rates. These responses were due to an increased pulmonary ribosomal efficiency in the lung at this time. 4. We conclude that, in the short term, reduced pulmonary synthetic capacity is not a component of ozone-induced lung injury, but rather, this important component of the repair mechanism, can be up-regulated in response to lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research, Rayne Institute, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Birch", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8086223", "10.1177/096032719401300607"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
