The optical oscillator strengths for these transitions have been obtained by extrapolating the generalized oscillator strengths to the limit that the squared momentum transfer approaches to zero, which give an independent cross-check to the previous experimental and theoretical results. The integral cross sections for the valence-shell excitations of nitric oxide have been determined systematically from the threshold to 2500 eV with the aid of the newly developed BE-scaling method for the first time. The present optical oscillator strengths and integral cross sections of the valence-shell excitations of nitric oxide play an important role in understanding many physics and chemistry of the Earth's upper atmosphere such as the radiative cooling, ozone destruction, day glow, aurora, and so on."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000000284312882"], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Long-Quan", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ya-Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Lin-Fan", "Initials": "LF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29390809", "10.1063/1.5019284"]}}]}
