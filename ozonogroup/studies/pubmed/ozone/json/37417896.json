Our work features an implementation that incorporates core-valence separation into the strict and extended second-order MR-ADC approximations (MR-ADC(2) and MR-ADC(2)-X), providing efficient access to high-energy excited states without including inner-shell orbitals in the active space. Benchmark results on a set of small molecules indicate that at equilibrium geometries, the accuracy of MR-ADC is similar to that of single-reference ADC theory when static correlation effects are not important. In this case, MR-ADC(2)-X performs similarly to single- and multireference coupled cluster methods in reproducing the experimental XAS peak spacings. We demonstrate the potential of MR-ADC for chemical systems with multiconfigurational electronic structure by calculating the K-edge XAS spectrum of the ozone molecule with a multireference character in its ground electronic state and the dissociation curve of core-excited molecular nitrogen. For ozone, the MR-ADC results agree well with the data from experimental and previous multireference studies of ozone XAS, in contrast to the results of single-reference methods, which underestimate relative peak energies and intensities. The MR-ADC methods also predict the correct shape of the core-excited nitrogen potential energy curve, and are in good agreement with accurate calculations using driven similarity renormalization group approaches. These findings suggest that MR-ADC(2) and MR-ADC(2)-X are promising methods for the XAS simulations of multireference systems and pave the way for their efficient computer implementation and applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6084-8992"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States."}], "LastName": "Mazin", "ForeName": "Ilia M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2637-4134"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States."}], "LastName": "Sokolov", "ForeName": "Alexander Yu", "Initials": "AY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Theory Comput", "NlmUniqueID": "101232704", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9618"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37417896", "10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00477"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
