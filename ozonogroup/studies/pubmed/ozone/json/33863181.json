To investigate the role of ozone exclusion and detoxification in this protection, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ev. Wembley) was grown from seed, in controlled-environment chambers, under reciprocal combinations of [CO<sub>2</sub> ] at 350 or 700 \u03bcmol mol<sup>-1</sup> and [O<sub>3</sub> ] peaking at < 5 or 60 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup> , respectively. Cumulative ozone dose to the mesophyll and antioxidant status were determined throughout flag leaf development. Catalase activity correlated with rates of photorespiration and declined in response to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] and/or [O<sub>3</sub> ]. Superoxide dismutase activity was not significantly affected by either condition. Neither ascorbate nor glutathione content was enhanced by elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ]. In wheat, at moderately elevated [O<sub>3</sub> ], our results show that stomatal exclusion plays a major role in the protective effect of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] against O<sub>3</sub> damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, John Tabor Laboratories, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, Essex, CO4 3SQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKee", "ForeName": "I F", "Initials": "IF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Forstbotanik und Baumphysiologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg, Am Flughafen 17, D-79085, Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eiblmeier", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Forstbotanik, Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen, B\u00fcsgenweg 2, 37077 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Polle", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Aebi H. 1983.
