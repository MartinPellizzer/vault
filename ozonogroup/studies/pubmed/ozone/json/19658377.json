In the light of this, the authors of this paper reveal the results of recent studies dealing with influence of sudden and short-term changes in weather and climate on human health, and future expected climate changes due to \"greenhouse\" effect, increase in global temperature and tropospheric ozone depletion, as well. Special attention is given to climate shifts due to ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation) phenomenon because of its great impact on human society and epidemics of certain infectious diseases. The results of biometeorological studies dealing with complex influence of daily weather changes on incidence of certain diseases in Croatia have also been presented. In addition, the authors have stated their own view and opinion in regard to future biometeorlogical studies in Croatia in order to achieve better understanding of influence of climate and weather changes on human health, and help prevention of mortality and morbidity related to chronic noninfectious diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bani\u0107", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plesko", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plesko", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Editorial", "English Abstract"], "VernacularTitle": "Vrijeme, klima i zdravlje."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Croatia", "MedlineTA": "Lijec Vjesn", "NlmUniqueID": "0074253", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3477"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19658377"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
