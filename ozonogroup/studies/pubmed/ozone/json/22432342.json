This model was then validated by the experiments of acetic acid degradation in aqueous solution. It was found that the correlation coefficient of fittings was higher than 0.970. Three key operating factors affecting organic degradation in the Ti(IV)-catalyzed H2O2/O3 process were studied, including Ti(IV) concentration, dissolved ozone concentration and initial H2O2 concentration. Furthermore, some experiments were conducted to determine the rate constant for dissolved ozone decomposition initiated by Ti2O5(2+). The rate constant measured is almost in accord with the data analyzed by this kinetic model. The goodness of fittings demonstrated that this model could well describe the kinetics of the Ti(IV)-catalyzed H2O2/O3 reaction mathematically and chemically. Therefore, this kinetic model can provide some useful information to optimize the parameters in ozonation of water containing certain pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China. sptong@zjut.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Shaoping", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Shuqin", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Xiaofei", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Chunan", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22432342", "10.1016/s1001-0742(10)60675-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
