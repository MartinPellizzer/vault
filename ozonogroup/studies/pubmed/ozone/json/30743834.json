The materials chosen for investigation were selected based on their commercial availability and composition characteristics that suggested that they could act as catalysts. Synthetic wastewater (SWW) was used to mimic municipal secondary effluent wastewater while obtaining constant and reproducible matrix characteristics. Polonite\u00ae, wollastonite, zeolite, TiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (8%/92%), and AL-1010S (AlO<sub>2</sub>-based) were tested for their potential impact on efficiency of disinfection, based on the removal of E. coli bacteria and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), relative to conventional ozonation. Atrazine (ATZ), ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), and gemfibrozil (GBZ) were used as indicator compounds. Zeolite and wollastonite did not promote disinfection and CECs removal; TiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and AL-1010S provided improvement for both criteria, but to a lesser extent in SWW than in Milli-Q water; and Polonite\u00ae did not enhance the removal of CECs but led to the higher E. coli inactivation. These results suggest that Polonite\u00ae, AL-1010S, and TiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can act as catalysts and provide mechanisms to lower the ozone dose required to reach disinfection. The apparent kinetic constant of the reaction for the catalytic ozonation of ATZ, in the ultrapure water, was determined for Polonite\u00ae, TiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and AL-1010S. The reusability of the catalysts was demonstrated over four consecutive cycles of 6\u202fh of treatment in a continuous flow ozonation system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
