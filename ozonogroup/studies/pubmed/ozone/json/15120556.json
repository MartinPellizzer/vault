The fate of BDOC produced by ozonation in the BAC column was also evaluated by comparative experiment between the BAC supplied with the mixture of BDOC and non-BDOC and the BAC supplied only with non-BDOC. Fulvic acids extracted from two river sediments and one forest soil were used. BDOC produced by ozonation showed the same or lower adsorption capacity than non-BDOC after biodegradation. The adsorption rate of BDOC on GAC was lower than that of non-BDOC. BDOC produced by ozonation had low desorbability and majority of BDOC produced were not replaced by non-BDOC. BDOC in the ozonated fulvic acid did not affect the breakthrough of the ozonated fulvic acid on GAC in the early stage of adsorption, suggesting that most of BDOC were biodegraded on the surface of GAC before adsorption. Therefore, the production of BDOC by ozonation before the GAC treatment is very effective for the extension of GAC service life and the reduction of DOC loading to GAC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, 1-4-1 Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima 739-8527, Japan. wataru@hiroshima-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishijima", "ForeName": "Wataru", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Speitel", "ForeName": "Gerald E", "Initials": "GE", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XII14C5FXV", "NameOfSubstance": "fulvic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Geologic Sediments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15120556", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.03.009", "S0045-6535(04)00171-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
