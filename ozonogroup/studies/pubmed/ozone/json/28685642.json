The researched technology utilized a simultaneous application of ozone, ultraviolet radiation and surface-immobilized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle catalyst. Various combinations of processes were tested, including photolysis, photocatalysis, ozonation, catalytic ozonation, photolytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation were tested against the efficiency of degradation. The efficiency of the processes was primarily characterized by the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, indicating the remaining organic material in the wastewater after the treatment, while the toxicity changes in wastewater were researched by Daphnia magna toxicity tests. Photocatalytic ozonation was confirmed as the most effective combination of processes (99.3% of TOC reduction during 180\u2005min of treatment), also being the most energy efficient (4.49-7.83\u2005MJ/g). Photocatalytic ozonation and photolytic ozonation remained efficient across a wide range of pH (3-9), but the pH was an important factor in photocatalysis. The toxicity of wastewater depended on the duration of the treatment: half treated water was highly toxic, while fully treated water did not possess any toxicity. Our results indicate that photocatalytic ozonation has a high potential for the upscaling and application in industrial settings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Technology , Kaunas University of Technology , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tichonovas", "ForeName": "Martynas", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Technology , Kaunas University of Technology , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krugly", "ForeName": "Edvinas", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Technology , Kaunas University of Technology , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grybauskas", "ForeName": "Arturas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Technology , Kaunas University of Technology , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jank\u016bnait\u0117", "ForeName": "Dalia", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Technology , Kaunas University of Technology , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ra\u010dys", "ForeName": "Viktoras", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Technology , Kaunas University of Technology , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martuzevi\u010dius", "ForeName": "Dainius", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Daphnia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interior Design and Furnishings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28685642", "10.1080/09593330.2017.1352037"]}}]}
