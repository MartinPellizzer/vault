In this study, online measurements of 74 VOCs were made in a typical industrial area of the Pearl River Delta in southern China during the early summer of 2021. The mean volume mixing ratio of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) was (81.9\u00b145.4)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> during the campaign. Among them, oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) accounted for the largest fraction of TVOC, with an average of 51.5%, followed by aromatics, accounting for 19.4% of TVOC. The proportion of OVOCs in TVOC gradually increased with the increase in TVOC concentration. Industry-related emissions were the main contributors to aromatics and OVOCs in this region. Aromatics and OVOCs were the two major contributors to the ozone formation potential (OFP), accounting for 56.4% and 26.7%, respectively. Furthermore, OVOCs also contributed 40.0% of the total \u00b7OH reactivity from VOCs. Xylenes, toluene, acrolein, and ethyl acetate had a greater contribution to the formation of secondary pollution; thus, these species should be given priority for controlling secondary pollution. Our results underscore the severity of OVOCs pollution in industrial areas and the important roles of OVOCs in secondary pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
