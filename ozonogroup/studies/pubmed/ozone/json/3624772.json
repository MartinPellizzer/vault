The present study was undertaken to investigate whether similar ozone exposure would cause inhibition of metabolism of another model drug, [14C]antipyrine, in conscious rats. Furthermore, this study also investigated whether, like that of ozone, other lipid-peroxidizing agents such as cadmium and carbon tetrachloride would affect metabolism of [14C]antipyrine in conscious rats. The results showed no significant effect of ozone exposure on subsequent metabolism of [14C]antipyrine in conscious rats as revealed by very similar 14CO2 exhalation rate (CER)-time profiles before and after ozone treatment under various exposure protocols. Even though the exposure to ozone caused no inhibition of antipyrine metabolism in conscious rats, cadmium and carbon tetrachloride, on the other hand, markedly inhibited metabolism of this model drug. In agreement with the reported sex-difference in toxic effects of cadmium, during the present study the cadmium-induced inhibitory effect on the CER-time profiles was observed in male but not in female rats. In contrast, no clear sex-dependency was noted in the inhibitory effect of carbon tetrachloride on [14C]antipyrine metabolism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dutta", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamat", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gole", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8109495", "ISSNLinking": "0260-437X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T3CHA1B51H", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipyrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antipyrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3624772", "10.1002/jat.2550070205"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
