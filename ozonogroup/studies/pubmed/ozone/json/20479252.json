Its spread has the potential to raise ozone levels in the region by increasing nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soils as a consequence of increasing nitrogen (N) inputs and cycling in soils. We studied the effects of kudzu invasions on soils and trace N gas emissions at three sites in Madison County, Georgia in 2007 and used the results to model the effects of kudzu invasion on regional air quality. We found that rates of net N mineralization increased by up to 1,000%, and net nitrification increased by up to 500% in invaded soils in Georgia. Nitric oxide emissions from invaded soils were more than 100% higher (2.81 vs. 1.24 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)). We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate the potential impact of kudzu invasion on regional atmospheric chemistry and air quality. In an extreme scenario, extensive kudzu invasion leads directly to an increase in the number of high ozone events (above 70 ppb) of up to 7 days each summer in some areas, up from 10 to 20 days in a control scenario with no kudzu invasion. These results establish a quantitative link between a biological invasion and ozone formation and suggest that in this extreme scenario, kudzu invasion can overcome some of the air quality benefits of legislative control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5245, USA. jeh2179@columbia.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hickman", "ForeName": "Jonathan E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shiliang", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mickley", "ForeName": "Loretta J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lerdau", "ForeName": "Manuel T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 28;107(39):E153; author reply E154. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1009093107", "PMID": "20855586"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Georgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pueraria"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "D'Antonio CM.
