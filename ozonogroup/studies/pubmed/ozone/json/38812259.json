However, there is limited research on this topic, and the sensitive exposure windows remain unclear. The present study assessed the association between AP exposure and the risk of PROM, as well as seeking to identify the sensitive time windows. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study analyzed 4276 pregnant women's data from Tongling Maternal and Child Health Hospital from 2020 to 2022. We obtained air pollution data, including particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of \u22642.5 \u03bcm (PM\u2082\u2024\u2085), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of \u226410 \u03bcm (PM\u2081\u2080), nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082), and ozone (O\u2083), from the Tongling Ecology and Environment Bureau. Demographic information was extracted from medical records. We employed a distributed lag model to identify the sensitive exposure windows of prenatal AP affecting the risk of PROM. We conducted a sensitivity analysis based on pre-pregnancy BMI. RESULTS We found a significant association between prenatal exposure to AP and increased PROM risk after adjusting for confounders, and the critical exposure windows of AP were the 6th to 7th months of pregnancy. In the underweight group, an increase of 10 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 in PM\u2082\u2024\u2085 was associated with a risk of PROM, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.89). Similarly, a 10 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 increase in PM\u2081\u2080 was associated with a risk of PROM, with an OR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.77). CONCLUSIONS Prenatal exposure to AP, particularly during months 6-7 of pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of PROM. This study extends and strengthens the evidence on the association between prenatal exposure to AP and the risk of PROM, specifically identifying the critical exposure windows."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Maternal Health Care, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Tongling, Tongling, Anhui, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiaowu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Diseases, The Public Health Service Center of Economic Development Zone of Hefei, Hefei, Anhui, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Fengsheng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of AIDS Prevention and Control, Center for Disease Control of Liuan, Liuan, Anhui, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Gongyan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Maternal Health Care, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Tongling, Tongling, Anhui, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Sci Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "9609063", "ISSNLinking": "1234-1010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of interest:</b> None declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Mercer BM.
