The underlying mechanisms were understudied, especially in relation to coronary stenosis leading to myocardial ischemia. Advances in computed tomography (CT) allow for novel quantification of lesion ischemia. We aim to investigate associations between air pollution exposures and fractional flow reserve on CT (CT-FFR), a measure of coronary artery blood flow.", "CT-FFR, which defines a ratio of maximal myocardial blood flow compared to its normal value (range: 0-100%), was characterized in 2017 patients with atherosclerosis between 2015 and 2017. Exposures to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) were estimated using high-resolution exposure models. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association of each air pollutant with CT-FFR and with the prevalence of clinically relevant myocardial ischemia (CT-FFR <75%).", "Participants were on average 60.1 years old. Annual mean O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> were 61, 47 and 60 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Mean CT-FFR value was 76.9%. In the main analysis, a higher level of O<sub>3</sub> was associated with a lower CT-FFR value (-1.74%, 95% CI: -2.85, -0.63 per 8 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and a higher prevalence of myocardial ischemia (odds ratio: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65), adjusting for potential confounders such as risk factors and plaque phenotypes, independent of the effects of exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. No associations were observed for PM<sub>2.5</sub> or NO<sub>2</sub> with CT-FFR.", "Long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> is associated with lower CT-FFR value in atherosclerotic patients, indicating higher risk of lesion ischemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Muwu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Zhihui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Koyratty", "ForeName": "Nadia", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA; College of Land Management, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Conghong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Kexin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Guan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "LaMonte", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Lundquist Institute at Harbor UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Budoff", "ForeName": "Matthew J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}], "LastName": "Kaufman", "ForeName": "Joel D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.
