Previous studies have shown that high ozone mixing ratios in the Uinta Basin are driven by elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) from regional oil and gas development coupled with temperature inversions and enhanced photochemistry from persistent snow cover. Here, we show that persistent snow cover and temperature inversions, along with abundant ammonia, also lead to wintertime haze in this region. A study was conducted at DINO from November 2018 through May 2020 where ozone, speciated fine and coarse aerosols, inorganic gases, and VOCs were measured. Three National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) ozone exceedances were observed in the first winter, and no exceedances were observed in the second winter. In contrast, elevated levels of particulate matter were observed both winters, with 24-h averaged particle light extinction exceeding 100\u00a0Mm<sup>-1</sup>. These haze events were dominated by ammonium nitrate, and particulate organics were highly correlated with ammonium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate formation was limited by nitric acid in winter. As such, reductions in regional NO<sub>x</sub> emissions should reduce haze levels and improve visibility at DINO in winter. Long-term measurements of particulate matter from nearby Vernal, Utah, suggest that visibility impairment is a persistent issue in the Uinta Basin in winter. From April through October 2019, relatively clean conditions occurred, with average particle extinction of ~10\u00a0Mm<sup>-1</sup>. During this period, ammonium nitrate concentrations were lower by more than an order of magnitude, and contributions from coarse mass and soil to haze levels increased. VOC markers indicated that the high levels of observed pollutants in winter were likely from local sources related to oil and gas extraction activities.<i>Implications</i>: Elevated ground-level ozone and haze levels were observed at Dinosaur National Monument in winter. Haze episodes were dominated by ammonium nitrate, with 24-h averaged particle light extinction exceeding 100 Mm<sup>-1</sup>, reducing visual range near the surface to ~35 km. Despite elevated ammonium nitrate concentrations, additional gas-phase ammonia was available, such that any increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the region is likely to lead to even greater haze levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Park Service, Air Resources Division, Lakewood, Colorado, USA."}], "LastName": "Prenni",
