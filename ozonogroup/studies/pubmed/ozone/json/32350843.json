Catechin and salicylic acid were proposed as tools for alleviating oxidative stress in plants, but their roles in protecting rice productivity under ozone stress still remained unknown. We investigated the mechanism of catechin and salicylic acid on rice under ozone stress at the vegetative stage and at the reproductive stage. Rice was sprayed with catechin and salicylic acid before exposure to ozone in the range of 100-150\u00a0ppb (8\u00a0h\u00a0day<sup>-1</sup>). Ozone and salicylic acid led to a decrease in chlorophyll contents, magnesium contents, and stomatal conductance. This evidence led to a decrease in rice productivity and quality. In contrast, under rice + catechin, both ambient air and elevated ozone conditions had to higher rice productivity and quality than under rice alone and rice + salicylic acid conditions. Catechin could mitigate ozone stress in rice plants through maintaining chlorophyll contents, magnesium contents, and stomatal conductance. Moreover, catechin could induce an unregulation of\u00a0ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase genes led to increasing their antioxidant enzyme activity. Increasing of antioxidant enzyme activity under rice + ozone + catechin conditions attributed to lower lipid peroxidation than under rice + ozone especially at vegetative stage. This study confirmed that catechin, which is naturally found in tea leaves, could be used as an ozone protectant. The protective role of catechin on chlorophyll contents and antioxidant systems at the vegetative stage attributed to maintaining rice yield under ozone stress.
