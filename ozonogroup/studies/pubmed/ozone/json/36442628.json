Quantifying long-term O<sub>3</sub> variations and their attributions helps to understand the causes of regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution and to formulate according control strategy. In this study, we present long-term trends of O<sub>3</sub> in the warm seasons (April-September) during 2006-2019 at an agricultural site in the NCP and investigate the relative contributions of meteorological and anthropogenic factors. Overall, the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> exhibited a weak decreasing trend with large interannual variability. < 6 % of the observed trend could be explained by changes in meteorological conditions, while the remaining 94 % was attributed to anthropogenic impacts. However, the interannual variability of warm season MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> was driven by both meteorology (36 \u00b1 28 %) and anthropogenic factors (64 \u00b1 27 %). Daily maximum temperature was the most essential factor affecting O<sub>3</sub> variations, followed by ultraviolet radiation b (UVB) and boundary layer height (BLH), with rising temperature trends inducing O<sub>3</sub> inclines throughout April to August, while UVB mainly influenced O<sub>3</sub> during summer months. Under changes in emissions and air quality, warm season O<sub>3</sub> production regime gradually shifted from dominantly VOCs-limited during 2006-2015 to NO<sub>x</sub>-limited afterwards. Relatively steady HCHO and remarkably rising NO<sub>x</sub> levels resulted in the fast decreasing MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> (-2.87 ppb yr<sup>-1</sup>) during 2006-2012. Rapidly decreasing NO<sub>x</sub>, flat or slightly increasing HCHO promoted O<sub>3</sub> increases during 2012-2015 (9.76 ppb yr<sup>-1</sup>). While afterwards, slow increases in HCHO and downwards fluctuating NO<sub>x</sub> led to decreases in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> (-4.97 ppb yr<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, continuous warming trends might promote natural emissions of O<sub>3</sub> precursors and magnify their impacts on agricultural O<sub>3</sub> by inducing high variability, which would require even more anthropogenic reduction to compensate for."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
