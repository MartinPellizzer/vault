The principal features identified are the bands of the Deltaupsilon = 2 and Deltaupsilon = 1 sequences of the vibration-rotation spectrum of OH. The brightness of the 1-0 band at night was measured to be in the range 270-400 kR on two flights. A sudden decrease in the intensity of the hydroxyl bands occurred in morning twilight at a solar depression of 4 degrees and is ascribed to the photodissociation of ozone. The temperature, as indicated by the Q/R branch ratio, rose from 170 K at night to 255 K at noon indicating a reduction in the height of the emitting layer during the day."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lowe", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lytle", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20125347", "10.1364/AO.12.000579", "17743"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
