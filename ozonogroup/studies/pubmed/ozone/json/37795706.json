To reveal the micro physico-chemical mechanism of the influence of a magnetic field and discharge parameters of discharge voltage and frequency on ozone generation, a plasma chemical reaction network involving electron collision-chain reactions was considered. The results show that these parameters jointly influence ozone generation by affecting electron collision reactions and chain chemical reactions by changing the mean electron energy and plasma gas temperature. In this study, both the experimental results and mechanism analysis suggested that an optimal discharge parameter for ozone generation is the magnetic field assisted, low frequency, high voltage (6.5 kHz, 6.5 kV) surface dielectric barrier discharge. These insights provide guidance for optimizing the discharge parameters of the magnetic field assisted discharge to increase ozone production and reduce energy consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China. liukun@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiong-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China. liukun@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ming-Hao", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China. liukun@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Hong-Fu", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China. liukun@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Wen-Qiang", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7821-6205"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China. liukun@cqu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37795706", "10.1039/d3cp03541g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
