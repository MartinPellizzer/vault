This study conducted a field campaign at high temporal and spatial resolution to monitor VOCs within three plants in an industrial park in southern China. VOC concentrations showed significant spatial variability in this industrial zone, with median concentrations of 75.22, 40.53, and 29.41\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for the total VOCs in the three plants, respectively, with oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) or aromatics being the major VOCs. Spatial variability within each plant was also significant but VOC-dependent. Seasonal variations in the VOC levels were governed by their industrial emissions, meteorological conditions, and photochemical losses, and they were different for the four groups of VOCs. The temporal and spatial variations in the VOC compositions suggest similar sources of each class of VOCs during different periods of the year in each plant. The diurnal patterns of VOCs (unimodal or bimodal) clearly differed from those at most industrial/urban locations previously, reflecting a dependence on industrial activities. The secondary transformation potential of VOCs also varied temporally and spatially, and aromatics generally made the predominant contributions in this industrial park. The loss rate of OH radicals and ozone formation potential were highly correlated, but the linear relationship substantially changed in summer and autumn due to the intensive emissions of an OVOC species. The lifetime cancer and non-cancer risks via occupational inhalation of the VOCs in the plants were acceptable but merit attention. Taking the secondary transformation potential and health risks into consideration, styrene, xylene, toluene, trichloroethylene, and benzene were proposed to be the priority VOCs regulated in the plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
