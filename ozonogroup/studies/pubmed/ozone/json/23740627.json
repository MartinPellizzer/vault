There is sufficient evidence to suggest that older adults (\u226565 years old) are more susceptible to air pollution-induced health effects compared to younger adults due to decreased physiological, metabolic and compensatory processes, and a greater incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory disease. This review examines health effects induced by exposures to common ambient air pollutants regulated by the European Union and the United States. Studies were evaluated that examined the potential susceptibility of older adults to air pollutant-induced health effects. This review focuses on epidemiologic studies that directly compared the health effects of older adults to younger adults and/or the general population in order to compare populations within the same study design. Supplementary information is used from controlled human exposure studies, which examined only older adults, and animal toxicological studies, which utilized animal models of senescence, to provide coherence and biological plausibility for the health effects observed in epidemiologic studies. Overall, evidence from available published studies demonstrates that older adults may be more susceptible to air pollution-induced health effects than younger adults and/or the general population. Clinicians and other health professionals should consider advising older adults on pollution-avoiding behaviors in order to decrease the risk of adverse air pollution-related health effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, at National Center for Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "LastName": "Shumake", "ForeName": "Kathryn L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sacks", "ForeName": "Jason D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Janice S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johns", "ForeName": "Douglas O", "Initials": "DO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Aging Clin Exp Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101132995", "ISSNLinking": "1594-0667"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23740627", "10.1007/s40520-013-0001-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
