These data were collected on hourly basis over a 12-month period. Sampling of the data was conducted automatically. The effect of the NMHC, NO, NO2,CO, temperature and solar radiation variables in predicting ozone concentrations was examined under two scenarios: (i) when NO is included with the absence of NO2; and (ii) when NO2 is addressed with the absence of NO. The results of these two scenarios were validated against ozone actual data. The predicted concentration of ozone in the second scenario (i.e., when NO2 is addressed) was in better agreement with the real observations. In addition, the paper indicated that statistical models of hourly surface ozone concentrations require interactions and non-linear relationships between predictor variables in order to accurately capture the ozone behavior."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. sabah1@squ.edu.om"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdul-Wahab", "ForeName": "Sabah A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdo", "ForeName": "Jamil", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17129943", "10.1080/10934520601015388", "GV77R1J486026234"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
