The pattern of such changes varies with species, but trends suggest a comprehensive model. O(3) generally reduces the amount of dry matter in the whole plant. In plants which have not flowered or set fruit, and at low O(3) levels, the remaining available assimilate is generally diverted to leaves and stems at the expense of roots and crowns. As the plant matures, flowers and develops seeds, these sinks receive a relatively high proportion of the available assimilate. O(3) may reduce the number of flowers or seeds, but the remaining seeds often have a total dry matter accumulation comparable to that in non-stressed plants. At higher O(3) levels, assimilate accumulation is greatly depressed, and partitioning changes are not as obvious. However, it is significant that the storage organs of plants-those organs which supply energy for new growth in perennial plants such as trees-are the organs most affected by O(3)-induced partitioning changes when O(3) concentrations are in the range commonly observed in polluted ambient air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cooley", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manning", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092712", "10.1016/0269-7491(87)90040-6", "0269749187900406"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
