The main objective of this study was to estimate BTEX levels and evaluate interspecies ratios and ozone formation potentials (OFP) in the ambient air of urban Kuala Lumpur (KL) based on a passive sampling method with a Tenax\u00ae GR adsorbent tube. Analysis of BTEX was performed using a thermal desorption (TD)-gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GCMS). OFP was calculated based on the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR). Results from this study showed that the average total BTEX during the sampling period was 66.06\u2009\u00b1\u20092.39\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Toluene (27.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.97\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) was the highest, followed by m,p-xylene (13.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), o-xylene (11.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.39\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), ethylbenzene (8.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.34\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and benzene (3.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). The ratio of toluene to benzene (T:B) is >\u20097, suggesting that VOCs in the Kuala Lumpur urban environment are influenced by vehicle emissions and other anthropogenic sources. The average of ozone formation potential (OFP) value from BTEX was 278.42\u2009\u00b1\u200974.64\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> with toluene and xylenes being the major contributors to OFP. This study also indicated that the average of benzene concentration in KL was slightly lower than the European Union (EU)-recommended health limit value for benzene of 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> annual exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Development (LESTARI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences and Environment, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Hamid", "ForeName": "Haris Hafizal Abd", "Initials": "HHA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2339-3321"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences and Environment, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia. talib@ukm.edu.my."}], "LastName": "Latif", "ForeName": "Mohd Talib", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences and Environment, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Uning", "ForeName": "Royston", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences and Environment, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Tropical Climate Change System, Institute of Climate Change, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Nadzir", "ForeName": "Mohd Shahrul Mohd", "Initials": "MSM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Md Firoz", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Development (LESTARI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Ta", "ForeName": "Goh Choo", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Smart Green Consultancy Sdn Bhd, 20A Jalan Ipoh Kecil, Off Jalan Ipoh, 50350, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Kannan", "ForeName": "Narayanan", "Initials": "N"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AP-2015-010", "Agency": "Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "DIP-2019-006", "Agency": "Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L5I45M5G0O", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylbenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32382809", "10.1007/s10661-020-08311-4", "10.1007/s10661-020-08311-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
