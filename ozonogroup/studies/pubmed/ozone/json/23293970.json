For pulmonary effects, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and fluid were analyzed. Data revealed a significant increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), total protein and albumin concentrations in the O\u2083 group, reflecting inflammatory and toxic responses. A subsequent exposure to TS attenuated PMN infiltration into the airspaces and their recovery in the BAL. A similar reduction was observed for BAL protein and albumin in the O\u2083/TS group, but it was not statistically significant. We also observed a significant increase in BAL total antioxidant capacity following O\u2083 exposure, suggesting development of protective mechanisms for oxidative stress damage from O\u2083. Exposure to TS attenuated the levels of total antioxidant capacity. Lung tissue protein analysis showed a significant reduction of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) in the O\u2083 or O\u2083/TS group and catalase in the O\u2083/TS group. TS further altered O\u2083-induced EC-SOD and catalase protein expression, but the reductions were not significant. For effects in the central nervous system (CNS), we measured striatal dopamine levels by HPLC with electrochemical detection. O\u2083 exposure produced a nonsignificant decrease in the striatal dopamine content. The effect was partially reversed in the O\u2083/TS group. Overall, the results show that the toxicity of O\u2083 in the lung is modulated by TS exposure, and the attenuating trend, though nonsignificant in many cases, is contrary to the synergistic toxicity predicted for TS and O\u2083, suggesting limited cross-tolerance following such exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhoopalan", "ForeName": "Vanitha", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Sung Gu", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Mrudang M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhalla", "ForeName": "Deepak K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23293970", "10.3109/08958378.2012.751143"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
