Gamma knife radiosurgery has been used to treat many types of brain tumors and as a functional intervention. However, gamma knife treatment has a devastating effect on the normal brain parenchyma surrounding the target point. It causes increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, and swelling in endothelial cells. Ozone has antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in the body. Thus, we evaluated the radioprotective effects of ozone in rats undergoing gamma knife radiation.", "In the present study, 24 Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 250-300 g in 3 groups of 8 rats each were used. The rats were selected randomly. The control group did not receive any gamma knife radiation. The other 2 groups received 50 Gy of radiation, with 1 group given ozone treatment and the other group not given ozone treatment after gamma knife radiosurgery. At 12 weeks after gamma knife radiation, the rats were sacrificed with high-dose anesthetic agents and the tissues prepared for evaluation. The slides were evaluated for necrosis, vacuolization, glial proliferation, and vascular proliferation using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (also known as CD147) were evaluated using immunohistochemical staining.", "VEGF expression in glial tissue was significantly less in the group receiving ozone (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>\u00a0= 15.00; df\u00a0= 4; P\u00a0= 0.005) compared with the group that had not received ozone and was similar to the expression in the control group.", "The lower expression of VEGF in the group receiving ozone might cause less edema in the surrounding tissue owing to less degradation of vascular permeability in the rat brain tissue."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
