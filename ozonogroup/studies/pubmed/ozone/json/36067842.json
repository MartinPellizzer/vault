As a result of the recalcitrant nature of those complex organic dyes, the remediation of wastewater using conventional wastewater treatment techniques is becoming increasingly challenging. In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a potential alternative to treat organic dyestuffs discharged from industries. The most widely employed AOPs include photocatalysis, ozonation, Fenton oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, catalytic heterogeneous oxidation, and ultrasound irradiation. These processes involve the generation of highly reactive radicals to oxidize organic dyes into innocuous minerals. However, many conventional AOPs suffer from several setbacks, including the high cost, high consumption of reagents and substrates, self-agglomeration of catalysts, limited reusability, and the requirement of light, ultrasound, or electricity. Therefore, there has been significant interest in improving the performance of conventional AOPs using biopolymers and heterogeneous catalysts such as metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs). Biopolymers have been widely considered in developing green, sustainable, eco-friendly, and low-cost AOP-based dye removal technologies. They inherit intriguing properties like biodegradability, renewability, nontoxicity, relative abundance, and sorption. In addition, the immobilization of catalysts on biopolymer supports has been proven to possess excellent catalytic activity and turnover numbers. The current review provides comprehensive coverage of different AOPs and how efficiently biopolymers, including cellulose, chitin, chitosan, alginate, gelatin, guar gum, keratin, silk fibroin, zein, albumin, lignin, and starch, have been integrated with heterogeneous AOPs in dye removal applications. This review also discusses the general degradation mechanisms of AOPs, applications of biopolymers in AOPs and the roles of biopolymers in AOPs-based dye removal processes. Furthermore, key challenges and future perspectives of biopolymer-based AOPs have also been highlighted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
