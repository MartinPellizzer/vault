Notably, satellite and ground-level observations-based multimodel simulations demonstrate that the present and future predicted O<sub>3</sub> exposures could threaten food security. Hence, the present study aims at reviewing the phytotoxicity caused by O<sub>3</sub> pollution, which threatens the food security. The present review encompasses three major aspects; wherein the past and prevailing O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in various regions were compiled at first, followed by discussing the physiological, biochemical and yield responses of economically important crop species, and considering the potential of O<sub>3</sub> protectants to alleviate O<sub>3</sub>-induced phytotoxicity. Finally, the empirical data reported in the literature were quantitatively analysed to show that O<sub>3</sub> causes detrimental effect on physiological traits, photosynthetic pigments, growth and yield attributes. The review on prevailing O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over various regions, where economically important crop are grown, and their negative impact would support policy makers to implement air pollution regulations and the scientific community to develop countermeasures against O<sub>3</sub> phytotoxicity for maintaining food security."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
