In this work, we described several surface treatments of knitted silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds, namely sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, ultraviolet radiation exposure in an ozone atmosphere (UV/O3) and oxygen (O2) plasma treatment followed by acrylic acid (AAc), vinyl phosphonic acid (VPA), and vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA) immersion. The effect of these treatments on the mechanical properties of the textile constructs was evaluated by tensile tests in dry and hydrated states. Surface properties such as morphology, topography, wettability and elemental composition were also affected by the applied treatments. The in vitro biological behavior of L929 fibroblasts revealed that cells were able to adhere and spread both on the untreated and surface-modified textile constructs. The applied treatments had different effects on the scaffolds' surface properties, confirming that these modifications can be considered as useful techniques to modulate the surface of biomaterials according to the targeted application."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3B's Research Group-Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics, Universidade do Minho, Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, AvePark, 4806-909, Caldas das Taipas, Portugal."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICVS/3B's-PT Government Associated Laboratory, Braga, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Ribeiro", "ForeName": "Viviana P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3B's Research Group-Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics, Universidade do Minho, Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, AvePark, 4806-909, Caldas das Taipas, Portugal."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICVS/3B's-PT Government Associated Laboratory, Braga, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "L\u00edlia R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3B's Research Group-Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics, Universidade do Minho, Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, AvePark, 4806-909, Caldas das Taipas, Portugal."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICVS/3B's-PT Government Associated Laboratory, Braga, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Ana R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3B's Research Group-Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics, Universidade do Minho, Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, AvePark, 4806-909, Caldas das Taipas, Portugal."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICVS/3B's-PT Government Associated Laboratory, Braga, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Pashkuleva", "ForeName": "Iva", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3B's Research Group-Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics, Universidade do Minho, Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, AvePark, 4806-909, Caldas das Taipas, Portugal."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICVS/3B's-PT Government Associated Laboratory, Braga, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Marques", "ForeName": "Alexandra P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CeNTI, Centre for Nanotechnology and Smart Materials, V.N.
