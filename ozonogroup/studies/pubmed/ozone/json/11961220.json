However, these adverse effects are not related to the suppression of virus-specific immune responses. Our laboratory showed that UVR increased the morbidity, mortality, and pathogenesis of influenza virus without affecting protective immunity to the virus, as measured by resistance to reinfection, suggesting that UVR and other immunosuppressive pollutants such as dioxin and ozone may exacerbate early responses that contribute to the pathogenesis of a primary viral infection. In the present study, we examined the mechanism of UVR-enhanced mortality in the absence of effects on virus-specific immunity and tested the hypothesis that modulation of cytokine levels was associated with increased deaths and body weight loss. BALB/c mice were exposed to 8.2 kJ/m(2) UVR and were infected 3 days later with a sublethal influenza virus infection (LD(40) of mouse-adapted Hong Kong influenza A/68, H(3)N(2)). Influx of inflammatory cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and cytokines produced by T-helper lymphocytes (Th1 and Th2) were measured in lung homogenates (LH) as well as in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). UVR preexposure decreased the influenza-induced lymphocytic influx 5 days after infection, but did not alter macrophage and neutrophil influx into the lung, or increase virus titers significantly. Although interferon (IFN)-gamma, total interleukin (IL)-12, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were altered in mice that received UVR exposure prior to infection, no clear association was made that correlated with the UVR-induced increase in body weight loss and mortality due to influenza infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunotoxicology Branch, Experimental Toxicology Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA. ryanlk@umdnj.du"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryan", "ForeName": "Lisa K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Copeland", "ForeName": "Lisa R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daniels", "ForeName": "Mary J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "Elisabeth R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selgrade", "ForeName": "Mary Jane K", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monokines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunocompromised Host"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Influenza A virus"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Monokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Orthomyxoviridae Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Th1 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Th2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11961220", "10.1093/toxsci/67.1.88"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
