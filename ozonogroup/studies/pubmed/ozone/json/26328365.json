We have pursued a means to control composition by varying Zr and Si containing precursor by cycle frequency. The molar ratio of Si to Zr in the Zr based films was 0.2, 0.25, 0.33, and 0.5. Addition of Si containing Zr precursor on Zirconium based thin films was effective for the decrease of the roughness, while an increase of density. XPS analysis indicated that the addition of Si containing Zr precursors in the Zr based film formed the silicate structure. The XRD analysis of the all ZrO2-SiO2 mixed films annealed at 600 degrees C for 5 min indicated the presence of amorphous. However, the ZrO2 film showed diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 30.6 degrees due to the presence of the Tetragonal ZrO2. The incorporation of Si into ZrO2 films helps stabilize an amorphous structure during deposition and annealing. The Zr based thin film (Si/Zr = 0.25) exhibited that the leakage current density was 6.2 x 10(-7) A/cm2 at a bias of - 1.5 V."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Jun Hee", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sang-Ick", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jong Hyun", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yim", "ForeName": "Sang Jun", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Hyung Soo", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Mi Jeong", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chae", "ForeName": "Won Mook", "Initials": "WM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sung Duck", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Chi Young", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Myong-Woon", "Initials": "MW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26328365", "10.1166/jnn.2015.8329"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
