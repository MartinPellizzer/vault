Balb/c mice were exposed to clean air or to 0.3 +/- 0.05 ppm ozone for 1-3 wk. Thymocytes and spleen T cells were stained with fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies against surface differentiation markers and/or propidium iodide for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The cells were then analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter. The percentages of certain thymocyte and spleen T lymphocyte subtypes and DNA synthesizing spleen T cells were lower following 1 wk of ozone exposure. After 3 wk exposure, the thymocyte percentages were higher in ozone-exposed mice, whereas the absolute number remained lower, and spleen T lymphocytes showed no changes. The findings suggest that short-term ozone inhalation can affect the T cell immune system adversely, particularly the CD4+ cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richters", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD4 Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "CD4 Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Gland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1992934", "10.1080/00039896.1991.9937430"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
