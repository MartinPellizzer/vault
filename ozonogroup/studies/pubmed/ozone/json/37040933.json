The 0-D box model incorporating the latest explicit chemical mechanism (MCMv3.3.1) was applied using an observation dataset (e.g., VOC, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, HONO, and PAN) as model contraints to explore the optimal reduction strategy for O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors. The results showed that \u2460 during high-O<sub>3</sub> episodes, stagnant weather conditions with high temperature and solar radiation as well as low relative humidity were observed, and oxygenated VOCs and alkenes from anthropogenic VOCs contributed the most to the total ozone formation potential and OH reactivity (<i>k</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>). \u2461 The in-situ O<sub>3</sub> variation was primarily affected by local photochemical production and export process horizontal to downwind areas or vertical to the upper layer. The reduction in local emissions was essential to alleviate O<sub>3</sub> pollution in this region. \u2462 During high-O<sub>3</sub> episodes, high concentrations of \u00b7OH (10\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) and HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7 (14\u00d710<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) radical drove and generated a high O<sub>3</sub> production rate (daytime peak value reached 36\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). The reaction pathways of HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7+NO and \u00b7OH+NO<sub>2</sub> contributed the most to the in-situ gross O<sub><i>x</i></sub> photochemical production (63%) and photochemical destruction (50%), respectively. \u2463 Compared to those during low-O<sub>3</sub> episodes, the photochemical regimes during high-O<sub>3</sub> episodes were more inclined to be considered as the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regime. Detailed mechanism modeling based on multiple scenarios further suggested that the synergic emission reduction strategy of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOC, while focusing on NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission alleviation, would be practical options for controlling local O<sub>3</sub> pollutions. This method could also provide policy-related guidance for the precise O<sub>3</sub> pollution prevention and control in other industrialized Chinese cities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Zhen-Sen", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zibo Ecological Environment Quality Control Service Center, Zibo 255030, China."}], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Jian-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guo-Tao", "Initials": "GT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li-Ming", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zibo Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Zibo 255000, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Zhi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37040933", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202210204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
