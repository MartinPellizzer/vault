Response and predictor data were collected on 290 white male volunteers 18 to 32 yr of age who were each exposed to one of six concentrations of ozone between 0.0 and 0.40 part per million. The sample was divided into an exploratory sample of 96 and a confirmatory sample of 194 subjects. Exploratory analysis indicated that ozone, age, and several other variables explained a significant proportion of the variance in response. In the confirmatory sample, only age and ozone concentration predicted FEV1 decrement. For the combined sample ozone explained 31% of the variance, with age accounting for an additional 4%. The model predicted a decreasing response with increasing age for all nonzero ozone concentrations. For exposure to 0.40 ppm, the model predicts decrements in FEV1 of 1.07 and 0.47 L for 18- and 30-yr-old subjects, respectively. We concluded that for white male subjects age was a significant predictor of response, with older subjects being less responsive to ozone. Furthermore, we demonstrated that exploratory analysis without control of type I statistical error rates may result in apparent findings that cannot be replicated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonnell", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muller", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bromberg", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shy", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8466115", "10.1164/ajrccm/147.4.818"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
