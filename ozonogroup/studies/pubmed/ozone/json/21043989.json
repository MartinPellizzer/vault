However, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which ozone affects human airway epithelium and subsequent airway inflammation.", "Human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to ozone at 0.16 mg/m(3) for varying periods. The concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 secreted by the cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the contents of intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined. Furthermore, the conditional medium from the ozone-exposed cells was examined for stimulating human peripheral T lymphocytes from asthmatic patients and healthy subjects, and the production of cytokines was characterized by ELISA and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).", "Ozone stimulated the IL-1 and IL-6 production by BEAS-2B cells and its stimulatory effects were time dependent. Furthermore, ozone exposure significantly increased the levels of MDA in BEAS-2B cells, as compared with that of the cells without ozone exposure, in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the conditional medium from the cells exposed to ozone, but not control condition medium, significantly increased the relative levels of IL-1 mRNA transcripts in human peripheral T lymphocytes from asthmatic patients, but not healthy subjects. However, the conditional medium did not induce significantly increased levels of IL-2 production by peripheral T cells.", "Our data indicated that exposure to low levels of ozone for a short period induced increases in the pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in epithelial cells, which might contribute to airway inflammation particularly in asthmatic children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, P.R.
