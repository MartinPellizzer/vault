Clinical questions have driven advances in clinical research that continue to deepen our understanding of COPD. At the same time, new perspectives, evidence, and strategies have emerged. Studies since 2022 have increased knowledge of the impact of risk factors, such as low-to-moderate income and ambient ozone, on the prevalence of COPD. The effect of preterm birth on obstructive lung function deficits and COPD in the sixth decade of life was investigated for the first time. Screening studies for COPD in developed and low- and middle-income countries suggest the importance of tailoring screening strategies to local conditions. Developments in artificial intelligence provide a general framework for using machine-learning-based methods and medical record-based labels to improve disease prediction. New perspectives on endotypes/phenotypes and prognostic assessment of COPD were provided by lifetime spirometry patterns of obstruction and limitation, sensitisation to recombinant <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> allergens, airway-occluding mucus plugs and exacerbation history in COPD group A and B patients. Clinical trials focusing on inflammatory mediators, comorbidity treatment, non-pharmacological treatments, and environmental interventions shed light on some crucial and long-debated issues. Further research is needed for individualised diagnosis and treatment of COPD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "F Y", "Initials": "FY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Z Y", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Y Q", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen 518020, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Shenzhen Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen 518020, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2022YFF0710802", "Agency": "National Key R&D Plan", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "82200044, 82270044, 82170042", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "KCXFZ202002011008256", "Agency": "Developing Foundation of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8712226", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0939"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artificial Intelligence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Premature Birth"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "27"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38062696", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20231019-00248"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
