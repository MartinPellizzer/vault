The performance and catalytic activity of HCOMF was evaluated for degradation of model wastewater containing bisphenol A (BPA) and humid acid (HA) under different permeation flux in long-term continuous experiments. The membrane fouling was investigated by trans-membranous pressure (TMP), membrane filtration resistance, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and fluorescence spectra. The results showed that HCOMF system exhibited an excellent and stable catalytic activity in long-term continuous experiments owning to integration of 3D MnO<sub>2</sub> hollow microsphere ozone-catalysis with flat-plate membrane filtration. The TMP of HCOMF system didn't increase significantly, and the membrane resistance R<sub>p</sub> and R<sub>c</sub> declined from 4% and 16% to 1% and 4%, respectively, thus, the membrane fouling of HCOMF system was mitigated compared to MF system. The mitigation of membrane fouling in HCOMF system was attributed to the increase of hydrophilicity of membrane surface and change of HA fractions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
