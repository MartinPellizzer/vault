However, climate warming and N deposition can modulate this limitation, and little is known about the combinative effects of them on N<sub>2</sub>O emission from boreal peatlands. In this study, experimental warming and N fertilization treatments were conducted at a boreal peatland in western Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to previous studies on permafrost peatland and alpine meadows, the effect of warming treatment on N<sub>2</sub>O flux was not detectable during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. The N fertilization treatment significantly increased the N<sub>2</sub>O flux by 1.61\u202fnmol\u202fm<sup>-2</sup>\u202fs<sup>-1</sup> due to increased N availability. Noticeably, warming reduced the effect of N fertilization treatment on N<sub>2</sub>O flux with high significance in the middle growing season of 2015. This can be attributed to low N availability caused by stimulated vegetation growth in the warming treatment. In addition, the results showed that total nitrogen was the main control on N<sub>2</sub>O emission under N fertilization, while dissolved organic carbon was the main driver under the combined treatment of warming and N fertilization. Due to elevated N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under N deposition/fertilization, the contribution of N<sub>2</sub>O to global warming and ozone depletion should not be ignored."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
