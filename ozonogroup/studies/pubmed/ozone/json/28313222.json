In plants, photosynthetic reactions and nucleic acids in the mesophyll of leaves are deleteriously affected by UV-B. We used a fiber-optic microprobe to make direct measurements of the amount of UV-B reaching these potential targets in the mesophyll of intact foliage. A comparison of foliage from a diverse group of Rocky Mountain plants enabled us to assess whether the foliage of some plant life forms appeared more effective at screening UV-B radiation. The leaf epidermis of herbaceous dicots was particularly ineffective at attenuating UV-B; epidermal transmittance ranged from 18-41% and UV-B reached 40-145 \u03bcm into the mesophyll or photosynthetic tissue. In contrast to herbaceous dicots, the epidermis of 1-year old conifer needles attenuated essentially all incident UV-B and virtually none of this radiation reached the mesophyll. Although the epidermal layer was appreciably thinner in older needles (7 y) at high elevations (Krumholtz), essentially all incident UV-B was attenuated by the epidermis in these needles. The same epidermal screening effectiveness was observed after removal of epicuticular waxes with chloroform. Leaves of woody dicots and grasses appeared intermediate between herbaceous dicots and conifers in their UV-B screening abilities with 3-12% of the incident UV-B reaching the mesophyll. These large differences in UV-B screening effectiveness suggest that certain plant life forms may be more predisposed than others to meet the challenge of higher UV-B levels resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, West Virginia University, 26506, Morgantown, WV, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Day", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Wyoming, 82071, Laramie, WY, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vogelmann", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, University of Illinois, 61801, Urbana, IL, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeLucia", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Oecologia. 1978 Jan;32(3):277-287", "ArticleIdList": ["28309272"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1990 Apr 13;248(4952):206-8", "ArticleIdList": ["2326634"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1992 Feb 14;255(5046):797-8", "ArticleIdList": ["17756420"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1991 Apr 12;252(5003):204", "ArticleIdList": ["17769255"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1975 Feb;55(2):407-13", "ArticleIdList": ["16659092"]}, {"Citation": "Photochem Photobiol. 1983 Apr;37(4):479-85", "ArticleIdList": ["6856690"]}, {"Citation": "Trends Ecol Evol. 1989 Dec;4(12):363-7", "ArticleIdList": ["21227379"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 May;85(9):2989-93", "ArticleIdList": ["16578833"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Feb;95(2):536-43", "ArticleIdList": ["16668017"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28313222", "10.1007/BF00317843", "10.1007/BF00317843"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
