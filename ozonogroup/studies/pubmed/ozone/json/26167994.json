Thirty-six adult male Wistar albino rats were used for this study. Monocortical defects were shaped in right femur of all rats. Defects were filled with nano-hydroxyapatite graft. The animals were divided into 3 groups and each group was than divided into 2 subgroups. Then, LLLT with a diode laser was applied to the first group (G1), ozone therapy was applied to the second group (G2), and no treatment was applied to the third group as a control group (G3). Animals were sacrificed after 4th and 8th weeks and the sections were examined to evaluate the density of the inflammation, the formation of connective tissue, the osteogenic potential, and osteocalcin activity. As a result, there were no significant differences among the groups of 4 weeks in terms of new bone formation. In the immunohistochemical assessment, the number of osteocalcin-positive cells was higher in the laser group compared to the other group of 4 weeks; this difference was statistically significant in the LLLT and ozone groups (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Histomorphometric assessment showed that the new bone areas were higher in the LLLT and ozone groups; furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference in the LLLT in comparison with the control group at 8th week (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). At the same time immunohistochemical assessment showed that osteocalcin-positive cells were considerably higher in G2 than G1 at 8th week (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). The findings of this study may be the result of differences in the number of treatment sessions. Further studies are therefore needed to determine the optimal treatment modality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "*Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey \u2020Department of Histology and Embriology, Faculty of Medicine, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey \u2021Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, Bezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey \u00a7Department of Prostodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Alan", "ForeName": "Hilal", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vardi", "ForeName": "Nigar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "\u00d6zg\u00fcr", "ForeName": "Cem", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Acar", "ForeName": "Ahmet H\u00fcseyin", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yolcu", "ForeName": "\u00dcmit", "Initials": "\u00dc"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Do\u011fan", "ForeName": "Derya Ozdemir", "Initials": "DO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Craniofac Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "9010410", "ISSNLinking": "1049-2275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Substitutes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "104982-03-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Osteocalcin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91D9GV0Z28", "NameOfSubstance": "Durapatite"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Craniofac Surg. 2015 Sep;26(6):e560. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000002201", "PMID": "26730650"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "radiotherapy", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Substitutes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Connective Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Durapatite"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Femur"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Semiconductor"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Low-Level Light Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteocalcin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26167994", "10.1097/SCS.0000000000001871", "00001665-201507000-00089"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
