The results showed that O3 concentrations fluctuated periodically,and the photochemical pollution in Ji'nan was serious. Diurnal variations of ozone concentrations exhibited with the characteristic of a single peak, and showed the maximum in the afternoon and minimum in the early morning before sunrise. Ozone concentrations in spring and summer were higher than autumn and winter, while the varying scopes of ozone concentrations in summer and autumn were broader than spring and winter. Variations of ozone concentrations in weekend days were different from weekdays, which caused by the temporal regulation of human activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Ji' nan 250100, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yong-Quan", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Wen-Po", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Li-Na", "Initials": "LN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yuan-Cheng", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17326444"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
