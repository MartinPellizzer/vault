In this study, we comprehensively analyzed long-term population exposure risks to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone in urban agglomerations of China during 2015-2021 regarding two-stage clean-air actions based on the Ministry of Ecology and the Environment (MEE) air monitoring network. Overall, the ratio of the population living in the regions exceeding the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) decreases by 29.9 % for PM<sub>2.5</sub> from 2015 to 2021, driven by high proportions in the Middle Plain (MP, 42.3 %) and Lan-Xi (35.0 %) regions. However, this ratio almost remains unchanged for ozone and even increases by 1.5 % in the MP region. As expected, the improved air quality leads to 234.7 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> avoided premature mortality (\u0394Mort), mainly ascribed to the reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration. COVID-19 pandemic may influence the annual variation of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related \u0394Mort as it affects the shape of the population exposure curve to become much steeper. Although all eleven urban agglomerations share stroke (43.6 %) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD, 30.1 %) as the two largest contributors to total \u0394Mort, cause-specific \u0394Mort is highly regional heterogeneous, in which ozone-related \u0394Mort is significantly higher (21 %) in the Tibet region than other urban agglomeration. Despite ozone-related \u0394Mort being one order of magnitude lower than PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related \u0394Mort from 2015 to 2021, ozone-related \u0394Mort is predicted to increase in major urban agglomerations initially along with a continuous decline for PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related \u0394Mort from 2020 to 2060, highlighting the importance of ozone control. Coordinated controls of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> are warranted for reducing health burdens in China during achieving carbon neutrality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
