Five toxic or hazardous analytes were found in the headspace phase of AFs (toluene, benzene, ethyl benzene, and m,p-xylene) at a frequency of more than 50%. Limonene and linalool, which are known to be unsaturated ozone-reactive VOCs, were detected at a frequency of 58 and 35%, respectively. The empirical model fitted well with the time-series concentrations in the chamber, thereby suggesting that the empirical model was suitable for testing emissions. Limonene exhibited the highest emission rate, followed by m,p-xylene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and benzene. For most target VOCs, higher air change per hour (ACH) levels exhibited increased emission rates. In contrast, higher ACH levels resulted in lower chamber concentrations. The mean concentration of limonene was significantly higher in passenger cars with an AF than without. For other target compounds, there were no significant differences between the two conditions tested. Consequently, it was suggested that unlike limonene, the emission strength for aromatic compounds identified in the chamber tests was not strong enough to elevate in-vehicle levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea. wkjo@knu.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jo", "ForeName": "Wan-Kuen", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jong-Hyo", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Mo-Keun", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Household Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17889253", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.08.021", "S0045-6535(07)01039-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
