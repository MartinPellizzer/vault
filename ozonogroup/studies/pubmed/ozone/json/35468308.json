Importantly, peculiar metabolic changes occurring in malignant cells (the increased glycolysis and the hampered Krebs cycle) may contribute to decreased antioxidant-dependent defense in ischemic and hypoxic tumors.", "In the clinic, oxygen saturation of tumors is usually achieved by the application of water-soluble ozone and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Tumor oxygenation has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and potentiate anti-tumor effects of chemoradiotherapy in animal experiments and the clinical setting. Tumor oxygenation could enhance anti-tumor effects achieved by tumor blood vessel occlusion or angiostatic therapy.", "Owing to a profound influence of ROS on both the innate and adaptive immunity, oxygen therapy, when combined simultaneously or sequentially with immunotherapeutic interventions (such as immune checkpoint inhibition, drug-induced immunostimulation, adoptive cell therapy, hyperthermia, etc.), could be considered as a novel highly-effective clinical biological approach to cancer treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Innovita Research Company, Vilnius, Lithuania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Immunotherapy, Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Seledtsov", "ForeName": "Victor Ivanovich", "Initials": "VI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Innovita Research Company, Vilnius, Lithuania."}], "LastName": "von Delwig", "ForeName": "Alexei A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Rev Anticancer Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101123358", "ISSNLinking": "1473-7140"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptive Immunity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Protocols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35468308", "10.1080/14737140.2022.2070153"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
