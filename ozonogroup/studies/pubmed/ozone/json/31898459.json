A reproducible method of establishing latent fingerprint age would allow forensic personnel to determine if a latent fingerprint was relevant to a crime. This work investigates the ambient aging of triacylglycerols (TGs) and other lipids in latent fingerprint residue utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. Unsaturated TGs were found to undergo ambient ozonolysis resulting in a decrease over time. At the same time, two series of compounds related to the degradation of unsaturated TGs due to ambient ozonolysis emerged with time and were detectable within a single day of aging. Tracking the degradation of unsaturated TGs over time proved to be relatively reproducible in multiple individuals and is suggested as a means of establishing latent fingerprint age."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Iowa State University , Ames , Iowa 50011 , United States."}], "LastName": "Hinners", "ForeName": "Paige", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Iowa State University , Ames , Iowa 50011 , United States."}], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Madison", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2533-5371"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Iowa State University , Ames , Iowa 50011 , United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Young Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31898459", "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b04765"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
