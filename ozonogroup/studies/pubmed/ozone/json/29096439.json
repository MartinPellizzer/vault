To effectively suppress the competitive OER and improve gaseous ozone escaping, here we present a capillary effect-enabled electrolysis strategy by employing an unusual partial-submersed mode of anode composed of a \u03b2-PbO<sub>2</sub> cuboids-loaded bulk porous Pb, and realize a much enhanced electrocatalytic gaseous ozone production in comparison to the cases of solid Pb counterpart and/or usual submersion operation. Detailed study reveals a capillary pressure-induced \"molecular oxygen-locking effect\" in the electrolyte fully filled in the porous structure of the electrode area above the electrolyte pool level, which unexpectedly leads to the production of unusual \u00b7O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> intermediate. Distinctive from the traditional electrochemical ozone production (EOP) mechanism dependent on the essential reaction between the atomic oxygen and molecular oxygen, the \u00b7O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> intermediate generation favors the EOP process in the special case where the capillary action is relevant for a porous bulk anode."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200050, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200050, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, PR China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yingfeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200050, PR China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200050, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaohua", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5570-4289"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200050, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, PR China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Fangfang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8790-195X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200050, PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, PR China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jianlin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29096439", "10.1021/jacs.7b07705"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
