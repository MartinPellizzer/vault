Simulations were performed using the HOTMAC boundary-layer meteorological model using a 1, 2, 4 and 8-km horizontal grid size nested mesh system. Investigation of the vertical structure and evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer for the August 12-14 time period is emphasized in this paper due to its suspected importance in precipitating the ozone episode [Sci Total Environ (2001)]. This period was characterized by a slowly-evolving high pressure system over the region, a persistent upper-level jet at 2500-3500 m above ground level (agl), deep daytime mixed layer heights of 3500 m depth and unusually deep nighttime stable layers extending up to 2500 m above the ground. The fact that the boundary-layer growth stalled on the morning of August 13 relative to that on August 12 has been suggested as a possible reason for the ozone episode on the 13th. In addition, relatively weak surface-level winds were measured on August 13. Using both model results and experimental data we hypothesize explanations for the slower mixed-layer growth on the morning of the 13th and the stronger surface-level winds found on the 12th and 14th."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Energy and Environmental Analysis, Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM 87545, USA. mbrown@lanl.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muller", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costigan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11516132", "10.1016/s0048-9697(01)00775-6", "S0048-9697(01)00775-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
