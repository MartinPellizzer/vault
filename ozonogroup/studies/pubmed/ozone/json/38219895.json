Here, a typical large-scale PC in North China was selected as the study case, to explore the character, formation and influence of local photochemical pollution regarding PCs based on an improved 0-D chemical model. In the study PC, VOCs-rich character was apparent with THCs level of 90.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.0\u00a0ppb and THCs/NOx ratio of \u223c26.2\u00a0mol/mol. Severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution was found in warm months with monthly mean MDA1O3 of 67.3-96.0\u00a0ppb. Model simulations showed the heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution in this PC was attributed to high precursors rather than to unfavorable meteorology, and was more sensitive to NOx (with response of 1.42\u00a0g/g) than to THCs (with response of 0.12\u00a0g/g). The photochemical pollution formation potential of the emission plumes of this PC was very enormous, with production rate of 19.6\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> for O<sub>3</sub>, 2.9\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> for HCHO and 1.1\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> for CH<sub>3</sub>CHO on daytime average, 1-5 greater than in normal urban areas. The higher production rates happened in morning hours, which explained the earlier peak time of observed O<sub>3</sub> in PCs. And about 70% of photochemical pollution (represented by O<sub>3</sub>) would be transported to surroundings, leading to the significant photochemical-pollution hazard to the vicinity of PCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
