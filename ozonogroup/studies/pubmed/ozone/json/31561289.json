In this technology, combining ozone and hydrogen peroxide generated electrochemically leads to the production of hydroxyl radicals, which are the strongest oxidizing agents. In this study, a cylindrical reactor with a continuous circular flow using novel arrangements of electrodes was used to examine the effects of variant parameters on dye removal efficiency. Acid Orange 7 (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N<sub>2</sub>NaO<sub>4</sub>S) served as an indicator pollutant. Based on overall energy consumption and energy consumption per dye removed weight, electro-peroxone not only has proper efficiency at high dye concentrations, it also has the least energy consumption per dye removed weight; 53\u202fKWh kg<sup>-1</sup> is achieved for 500\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> initial dye concentration at 99% removal efficiency after 40\u202fmin. The results show that at the optimum condition of [Dye]\u202f=\u202f500\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>, pH\u202f=\u202f7.7, applied current\u202f=\u202f0.5 A, O<sub>3</sub> rate\u202f=\u202f1\u202fL\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup>, and [Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]\u202f=\u202f0.1\u202fM, dye is removed completely after 90\u202fmin and COD and TOC removal is 99% and 90%, respectively. LC-MS results also showed that AO7 initially was converted to more toxic compounds than AO7 like benzoic acid but finally linear acidic intermediate with less toxicity such as fumaric acid was formed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
