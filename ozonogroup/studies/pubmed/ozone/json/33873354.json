Thallus dimensions and size, coverage of soralia, nitrogen fixation activity and levels of UV-C-absorbing substances were measured. \u2022 Warming had pronounced positive effects on the tridepsides methyl gyrophorate and gyrophoric acid, and unidentified trace substances. However, the combination of enhanced UV-B and increased temperatures did not lead to higher than control levels. Warming reduced coverage of soralia. There were no significant treatment effects on thallus size, dimensions and nitrogen fixation activity. \u2022 UV-B radiation did not to have any adverse effects. The accumulation of tridepsides with warming may be related to increased activity of pathogenic microorganisms or insect herbivores."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Troms\u00f8, N-9037 Troms\u00f8, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bjerke", "ForeName": "Jarle W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Troms\u00f8, N-9037 Troms\u00f8, Norway."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The University Centre on Svalbard (UNIS), N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zielke", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Troms\u00f8, N-9037 Troms\u00f8, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solheim", "ForeName": "Bj\u00f8rn", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bachereau F, Asta J. 1997.
