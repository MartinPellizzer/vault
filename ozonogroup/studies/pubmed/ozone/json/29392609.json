The effects of pre-ozonation on membrane microfiltration were investigated in detail both in case of ultrapure and model groundwater matrices, applying different durations (0, 5, 10, and 20\u00a0min) of pre-ozonation. Simultaneously, the effects of added inorganic water components on the combined method were investigated. Size distribution of oil droplets, zeta potentials, fluxes, and purification efficiencies were measured and fouling mechanisms were described in all cases. It was found that the matrix significantly affected the size distribution and adherence ability of oil droplets onto the membrane surface, therefore fouling mechanisms also were strongly dependent on the matrix. In case of low salt concentration, the total resistance was caused mainly by reversible resistance, which could be significantly reduced (eliminated) by pre-ozonation. In case of model groundwater matrix, nearly twice higher total resistance was measured, and irreversible resistance was dominant, because of the higher adhesion ability of the oil droplets onto the membrane surface. In this case, pre-ozonation resulted in much lower irreversible, but higher reversible resistance. Increased duration of pre-ozonation raised the total resistance and reduced the elimination efficiency (due to fragmented oil droplets and water soluble oxidation by-products) in both cases, therefore short pre-ozonation can be recommended both from economic and performance aspects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 9, Szeged, H-6725, Hungary. verebg@mk.u-szeged.hu."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9642-1851"], "LastName": "Ver\u00e9b", "ForeName": "G\u00e1bor", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 9, Szeged, H-6725, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kov\u00e1cs", "ForeName": "Ildik\u00f3", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 9, Szeged, H-6725, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zakar", "ForeName": "Mih\u00e1ly", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 9, Szeged, H-6725, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kert\u00e9sz", "ForeName": "Szabolcs", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 9, Szeged, H-6725, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hod\u00far", "ForeName": "Cecilia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 9, Szeged, H-6725, Hungary."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "ForeName": "Zsuzsanna", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25667-42-9", "NameOfSubstance": "polyether sulfone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfones"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2017 Jan;24(2):1757-1768", "ArticleIdList": ["27796984"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2001 Dec;35(17):4095-101", "ArticleIdList": ["11791839"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Sci (China). 2014 Apr 1;26(4):783-91", "ArticleIdList": ["25079408"]}, {"Citation": "Water Sci Technol. 2016;73(5):1098-103", "ArticleIdList": ["26942532"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2017 Jul;24(19):16253-16262", "ArticleIdList": ["28540548"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29392609", "10.1007/s11356-018-1287-9", "10.1007/s11356-018-1287-9"]}}]}
