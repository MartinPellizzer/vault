Based on data between 2015 and 2021, hourly NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase starting at 6:00 a.m. local time until 9:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m. local time, respectively, before gradually decreasing. The highest monthly NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are observed in October, August, and September, respectively. Annual median NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations range between 17\u00a0ppb and 38.8\u00a0ppb, 17.5\u00a0ppb-36.6\u00a0ppb, and \u223c14\u00a0ppb-30.8\u00a0ppb, respectively. Two to 93 days and 17-156 days between 2015 and 2021 exhibit daily concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0\u2264\u00a0WHO AQGs, respectively, while 187-294 days have 8-h maximum O<sub>3</sub> concentrations\u00a0\u2264\u00a0WHO AQGs. The mean excess mortality ascribed to respiratory mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospital admissions for COPD, and acute myocardial infraction are 121, 603, 39, and 145 during 2015-2021, respectively. O<sub>3</sub> is found to exert more significant health effects compared to SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in higher cardiovascular mortality. The gradual increase in NO<sub>2</sub> and possibly O<sub>3</sub> over the study period is suspected to be due to economic sanctions, while SO<sub>2</sub> decreased due to regulatory activity. Sustainable control strategies such as improving fuel quality, promoting public transportation and vehicle retirement, applying subsidies for purchase of electric vehicles, and application of European emission standards on automobiles can help decrease target pollutant levels in ambient air of cities in developing countries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
