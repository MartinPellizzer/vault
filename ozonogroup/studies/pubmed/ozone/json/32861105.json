ABPs hold promise thanks to their availability, ease of preparation, and low risk of adverse allogenic reaction, hypersensitivity, and contamination. Compositional analysis of ABPs reveals a diverse mixture of cellular components, cytokines and growth factors that play roles in healing processes such as tissue proliferation and angiogenesis, modulation of the local environment through chemotaxis and regulation of inflammation and the extracellular matrix, as well as several immunomodulatory actions. Thus, the administration of ABP induces supraphysiological levels of components necessary for orchestrating reparative efforts in currently difficult-to-treat medical conditions. In this article, we review the variety of autologous blood-derived products, their composition, current clinical uses, regulatory climate, and mechanisms of action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
