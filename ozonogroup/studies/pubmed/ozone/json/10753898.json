It is shown that ultraviolet B light supported only limited synthesis of protein D1, one of the most important components of photosystem II, whereas it promoted significant degradation of proteins D1 and D2. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of photosystem II subunits was specifically elicited upon exposure to ultraviolet B light. Structural modifications of photosystem II and changes in its lateral distribution between granum membranes and stroma-exposed lamellae were found to be different from those observed after photoinhibition by strong visible light. In particular, more complete dismantling of photosystem II cores was observed. Altogether, the data reported here suggest that ultraviolet B radiation alone fails to activate the photosystem II repair cycle, as hypothesized for visible light. This failure may contribute to the toxic effect of ultraviolet B radiation, which is increasing as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science and Advanced Technologies, University of Piemonte Orientale \"Amedeo Avogadro,\" Alessandria 15100, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barbato", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bergo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szab\u00f2", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalla Vecchia", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giacometti", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10753898", "10.1074/jbc.275.15.10976", "S0021-9258(19)80937-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
