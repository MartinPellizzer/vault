The improved stability of the ordered mesoporous carbon towards pore collapse was applied to the degradation of simulated high-salt phenol wastewater by an electrocatalytic ozonation process using simple binder pelletization. The modified ordered mesoporous carbon shows a specific surface area of 269.7\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> and a pore size of 3.17\u00a0nm, and SEM and TEM were used to show that the mesoporous structure is well maintained and the metal nanoparticles are well dispersed. The electrochemically active area of the Ni<sub>2%</sub>/Ce<sub>0.5%</sub>/Mn<sub>2.5%</sub>-NOMC particle electrode reaches 224.65\u00a0mF\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup>, which indicates that NiO improves the capacitance of the ordered mesoporous carbon and accelerates the electron transfer efficiency. Encouragingly, the phenol removal efficiency is found to reach up to 93.0% for 60\u00a0min over a wide range of pH values, with an initial phenol concentration of 150\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, low current (0.03 A) and fast reaction rate (0.0895 min<sup>-1</sup>), and the presence of CeO<sub>2</sub> ameliorates the low activity of the particle electrode under acidic conditions. These results indicate that the presence of pyridine-N and \u03b2-MnO<sub>2</sub> effectively mitigates carbon corrosion and improves electrode stability, as the accumulation of large amounts of \u00b7OH at 20\u00a0min and the maintenance of a degradation efficiency of more than 90% after eight cycles provides a viable solution for the widespread practical application of ordered mesoporous carbon particle electrodes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
