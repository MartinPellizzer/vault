Two different approaches, photodissociation of ozone and microwave discharge plasma in an argon and oxygen flow, were utilized for O(2)(a(1)\u0394(g)) generation. The d(1)\u03a0(g)\u2190a(1)\u0394(g) (3-0) and d(1)\u03a0(g)\u2190a(1)\u0394(g) (1-0) bands of O(2)(a(1)\u0394(g)) were detected by Radar REMPI for two different flow conditions. Quantitative absorption measurements using sensitive off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) was used simultaneously to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of the Radar REMPI technique. The detection limit of Radar REMPI was found to be comparable to the ICOS technique with a detection threshold of approximately 10(14) molecules/cm(3) but with a spatial resolution that was 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the ICOS technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mechanical, Aerospace and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, 1512 Middle Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhili", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ombrello", "ForeName": "Timothy M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7708433", "ISSNLinking": "0146-9592"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23811904", "10.1364/OL.38.002286", "258196"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
