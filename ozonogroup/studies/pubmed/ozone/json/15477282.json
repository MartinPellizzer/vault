Time series analyses were conducted of daily emergency hospital admissions, 1 April 1994 to 31 March 2000, using autoregressive Poisson models with adjustment for long term trend, season, day of week, public holidays, the Christmas period, influenza, relative humidity, air pollution (ozone, PM10), and overdispersion. The effects of heat were modelled using the average of the daily mean temperature over the index and previous two days.", "There was no clear evidence of a relation between total emergency hospital admissions and high ambient temperatures, although there was evidence for heat related increases in emergency admissions for respiratory and renal disease, in children under 5, and for respiratory disease in the 75+ age group. During the heat wave of 29 July to 3 August 1995, hospital admissions showed a small non-significant increase: 2.6% (95% CI -2.2 to 7.6), while daily mortality rose by 10.8% (95% CI 2.8 to 19.3) after adjusting for time varying confounders.", "The impact of hot weather on mortality is not paralleled by similar magnitude increases in hospital admissions in the UK, which supports the hypothesis that many heat related deaths occur in people before they come to medical attention. This has evident implications for public health, and merits further enquiry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public and Environmental Health Research Unit, Department of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK. sari.kovats@lshtm.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kovats", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hajat", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkinson", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9422759", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0711"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Emergencies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "London"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poisson Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Commun Dis Public Health. 2000 Mar;3(1):32-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10743316"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Prev Med. 1999 May;16(4):359-60", "ArticleIdList": ["10493296"]}, {"Citation": "J Epidemiol Community Health. 2002 May;56(5):367-72", "ArticleIdList": ["11964434"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Prev Med. 2002 May;22(4):221-7", "ArticleIdList": ["11988377"]}, {"Citation": "Epidemiol Rev. 2002;24(2):190-202", "ArticleIdList": ["12762092"]}, {"Citation": "J Epidemiol Community Health. 2003 Aug;57(8):628-33", "ArticleIdList": ["12883072"]}, {"Citation": "Q J Med. 1980 Winter;49(193):1-8", "ArticleIdList": ["7433626"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Emerg Med. 1985 Jul;3(4):327-30", "ArticleIdList": ["4005005"]}, {"Citation": "Injury. 1993 Apr;24(4):247-8", "ArticleIdList": ["8325682"]}, {"Citation": "N Engl J Med. 1996 Jul 11;335(2):84-90", "ArticleIdList": ["8649494"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health. 1997 Sep;87(9):1515-8", "ArticleIdList": ["9314806"]}, {"Citation": "Ann Intern Med. 1998 Aug 1;129(3):173-81", "ArticleIdList": ["9696724"]}, {"Citation": "J Epidemiol Community Health. 1998 Aug;52(8):482-6", "ArticleIdList": ["9876358"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Prev Med. 1999 May;16(4):269-77", "ArticleIdList": ["10493281"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 2001 May;109(5):463-70", "ArticleIdList": ["11401757"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15477282", "PMC1757853", "10.1136/oem.2003.012047", "61/11/893"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
