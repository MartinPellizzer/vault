Two important operational parameters namely liquid flow rate and ultrasonic power, were optimized with regard to the ozone mass transfer efficiency. Results showed that the mass transfer coefficient (K<sub>L</sub>a) increased with liquid flow rate (up to 14\u00a0L\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) and ultrasonic power (up to 1000\u00a0W). The maximum K<sub>L</sub>a value (1.0258 min<sup>-1</sup>) was obtained with the UC-RF coupled-field. Moreover, the reinforcement of mass transfer efficiency was promoted by the rotational flow field and UC-RF coupled-field due to the increase in the ozone-liquid contact area, intensification of turbulence, acceleration of interface renewal, and extension of residence time. Ozone microbubbles rose in the reactor in a spiral manner. In addition, the microbubbles produced in the rotational flow field served as cavitation nucleus that helped to generate the cavitation effect. The effective degradation of di-butyl phthalate (DBP) confirmed that its removal was improved by the ozone-liquid mass transfer and the promotion of hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) production. The synergistic effect of DBP degradation via ultrasound-enhanced ozonation was significant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
