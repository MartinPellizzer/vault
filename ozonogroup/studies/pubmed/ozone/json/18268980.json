Catalysts were prepared by sol-sel method, and sintered in electrical resistance furnace. The optimum sinter temperature was found for preparing the catalyst. The SEM was also used to characterize the catalyst. When the catalyst was sintered at 700 degrees C, it had the best property of catalysis. The catalytic ozonation of nitrobenzene was first order reaction with respect to the concentration of nitrobenzene, and OH* was the dominating species in the oxidation process. As the dose of catalyst increased, the removing rate of nitrobenzene also increased. The highest ozonation rate of this compound, which is 46.5%, was found when pH value was approximately 10. Besides, the catalyst showed good ability after 3 times repeated uses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zjing428@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yi-xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sheng-jun", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Qing-dong", "Initials": "QD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18268980"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
