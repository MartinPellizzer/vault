However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of the carbonyl-amine condensation reaction processes of OAs or between OAs and AHs, and subsequent environmental health impact. This work systematically investigated the carbonyl-amine condensation coupled ozonolysis kinetics, reaction mechanism, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and cytotoxicity from the mixture of dipropylamine (DPA) and styrene (STY) by a combined method of product mass spectrometry identification, particle property analysis and cell exposure evaluation. The results from ozonolysis of DPA and STY mixture revealed that STY inhibited the ozonolysis of DPA to different degrees to accelerate its own decay rate. The barycenter of carbonyl-amine condensation reactions was shifted from inside of DPA to between DPA and STY, which accelerated STY ozonolysis, but slowed down DPA ozonolysis. For the first time, ozonolysis of DPA and STY mixture to complex carbonyl-amine condensation products through the reactions of DPA with its carbonyl products, DPA with STY's carbonyl products and DPA's bond breakage product with STY's carbonyl products was confirmed. These condensation products significantly contributed to the formation and growth of SOA. The SOA containing particulate carbonyl-amine condensation products showed definite cytotoxicity. These findings are helpful to deeply and comprehensively understand the transformation, fate and environmental health effects of mixed organics in atmospheric environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
