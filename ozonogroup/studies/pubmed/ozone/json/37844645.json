However, our knowledge of the long-term trends in ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) after the implementation of these action plans in China remains limited. To address this, we conducted a five-year analysis (2016-2020) of VOC compositions and concentrations in Beijing. The annual VOC concentration decreased from 44.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.8 to 26.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.4 ppbv, with alkanes being the most prevalent group. The annual average concentrations of alkenes, alkynes, and aromatics have experienced a significant decrease of over 50\u00a0%. Seasonal variations indicated higher VOC concentrations in winter and autumn, with more significant reductions observed in winter and autumn. The impact of meteorological conditions caused variations in VOC reductions during the Chinese Spring Festival. Satellite-based measurements of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns confirmed the reduction of VOC emissions during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown. The normalized annual average VOC concentration decreased by 2.9ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup> from 2016 to 2020, and emission reduction contributed to 58.8\u00a0% of VOC reduction from 2016 to 2020 after meteorological normalization, indicating the effectiveness of implemented control measures. Based on receptor model, vehicle emissions and industrial sources were identified as the largest contributors to VOC concentrations. Vehicle emissions, liquefied petroleum gas/natural gas (LPG/NG) use, and coal combustion were major drivers of VOC reduction. Potential source region analysis revealed that air masses transported from northwestern and southern regions significantly contributed to VOC concentrations in Beijing. The range of source regions shrunk in both northwestern and southern regions with the reduction in VOC concentrations. The annual variations of ozone formation potential indicated a significant decrease in VOC reactivities through emission control. These results could provide insights into future emission control and coordinated efforts to improve PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone levels in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
