After sterilization, teeth were inoculated with S. mutans for 48 h. One cavity of each tooth was used to evaluate the infection. Following inoculation, infected cavity surfaces were treated either with (1) Er:YAG Laser (1W; 5x5s, Smart 2940D Plus, Deka Laser), (2) Ozone (80s; HealOzone, Kavo), (3) ErYAG-Ozone combination, (4) Er:YAG-Ozone-CHX combination, (5) Chlorhexidine (CHX), (6) Clearfil Protect Bond (PB), (7) potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) Laser (1W; 60 s, SMARTLITE D, Deka Laser), (8) KTP-Ozone combination, and (9) KTP-Ozone-CHX. Standardized amounts of dentin chips were obtained from the cavity walls, and the number of bacteria recovered was counted. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analyzes.", "Both sole antibacterial materials, CHX or Protect Bond application, exhibited the most effective antibacterial activity with 125 and 156 CFU is an acronym of \"colony forming unit\" usullay mentioned by acronym.

Er:YAG laser irradiation and its combinations with other antibacterial surface pretreatment applications also inhibited the bacterial growth with, respectively, 1444, 406, and 294 CFU/ml bacterial recovery being more efficient than KTP laser irradiation and ozone combinations.", "As an alternative device with photodynamic effects, Er:YAG and KTP laser irradiations and their further combinations during the cavity pretreatment procedure with chlorhexidine and ozone treatments exerted antibacterial effect against S. mutans, whereas chlorhexidine and antibacterial dentin bonding application solely have the highest antibacterial effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University, Bezmialem, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sancakli", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Bezmialem University, Bezmialem, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siso", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yildiz", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University, Bezmialem, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f6k\u00e7e", "ForeName": "Y B", "Initials": "YB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101150032"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adhesives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Adhesives"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Infection Control, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Laser Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Solid-State"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tooth"}], "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29465050", "10.4103/njcp.njcp_98_16", "NigerJClinPract_2018_21_2_170_225952"]}}]}
