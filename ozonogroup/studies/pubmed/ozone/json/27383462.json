Through optimizing the time of UV-ozone treatment, it is shown that Ag NWs electrode treated by UV-ozone for 10 s improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device based on the blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT): [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) from 0.76% to 1.34%. After treatment by UV-ozone, Ag NWs electrodes exhibit several promising characteristics, including high optical transparency, low sheet resistance and superior surface work function. As a consequence, the performance of devices utilizing 10 s UV-ozone-treated Ag NWs with", "PSS or MoO3 as composite anode showed higher PCEs of 2.77% (2.73%) compared with that for Ag NW electrodes without UV-ozone treatment. In addition, a PCE of 5.97% in flexible polymer solar cells based on poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl](PBDTTT-EFT):[6, 6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as a photoactive layer was obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials, and Institute of The Materials Science and Technology Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, 9 Wenyuan Road, Nanjing 210023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Danbei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Weixin", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yanwen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hongmei", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27383462", "10.1088/0957-4484/27/33/335203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
