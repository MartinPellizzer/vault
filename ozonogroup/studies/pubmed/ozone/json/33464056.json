Better understanding of the ozone/squalene reaction and product transport characteristics is thus important. In this study, we developed a physical-chemical coupling model to describe the behavior of ozone/squalene reaction products, that is, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA) in the gas phase and skin, by considering the chemical reaction and physical transport processes (external convection, internal diffusion, and surface uptake). Experiments without intervention were performed in a single-family house in California utilizing time- and space-resolved measurements. The key parameters in the model were extracted from 5 day data and then used to predict the behaviors in some other days. Predictions from the present model can reproduce the concentration profiles of the three compounds (ozone, 6-MHO, and 4-OPA) well (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.82-0.89), indicating high accuracy of the model. Exposure analysis shows that the total amount of 6-MHO and 4-OPA entering the blood capillaries in 4 days can reach 14.6 and 30.1 \u03bcg, respectively. The contribution of different sinks to ozone removal in the tested realistic indoor environment was also analyzed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Meixia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8057-4263"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Jianyin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BIC-ESAT and SKL-ESPC, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yingjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1060-1750"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, United States."}], "LastName": "Misztal", "ForeName": "Pawel K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4014-4896"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7QWM220FJH", "NameOfSubstance": "Squalene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Squalene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33464056", "10.1021/acs.est.0c06216"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
