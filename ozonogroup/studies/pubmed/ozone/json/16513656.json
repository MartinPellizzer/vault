To address the hypothesis that elevated ambient O(3) can induce cytogenetic damage in healthy people, we collected buccal cells from two groups of students (N = 126) from University of California, Berkeley, in the spring and again in the fall. One group spent their summer in the Los Angeles (LA) area where summer O(3) concentrations are significantly higher than in the San Francisco Bay (SF) area, and another remained in SF. During the school year, all students were exposed to low O(3) levels in SF. The micronucleus assay in a total of 611,000 buccal cells demonstrated that, in the fall, micronuclei (MN) in normal cells for the LA group had increased 39% relative to levels in the spring (1.52 and 0.87 MN/1,000 cells, respectively, P = 0.001). Students who spent the summer in SF had a 12.7% increase (P = 0.48). A similar effect of season was seen in degenerated buccal cells for the LA group (3.23 versus 1.88 MN/1,000 cells, P = 0.003). LA but not SF subjects also had more degenerated cells in the fall sample (P = 0.003). These findings were paralleled by an increase in MN and nucleoplasmic bridges in lymphocytes and MN in buccal cells in a sub-group of 15 students who underwent a 4-h controlled exposure to 200 p.p.b. O(3). This cytogenetic evidence, along with recent studies linking O(3) exposure to elevated lung cancer risk and mortality, suggest potential public health implications from exposures to high oxidant environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 94720-7360, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Connie", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arjomandi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Huaxia", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balmes", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tager", "ForeName": "Ira", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holland", "ForeName": "Nina", "Initials": "N"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "M01RR00083-41", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL60689", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Mutagenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8707812", "ISSNLinking": "0267-8357"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cheek"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16513656", "10.1093/mutage/gel007", "gel007"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
