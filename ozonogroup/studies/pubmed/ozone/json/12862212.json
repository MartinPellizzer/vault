In this case, the oxidation process has to be made as efficient as possible, in order to reduce the coats of ozone addition and use. An efficient oxidation process with ozone can be obtained by focusing the oxidation with ozone selectively on the direct oxidation of toxic pollutants and to minimize ozone losses due to the decay of ozone in water. Supported by data of the rate constants of the reactions involved, a mathematical model was developed. It quantifies the ozone consumption by the process, and the share of ozone consumption by undesired side reactions, in several different reactor systems. Results obtained with this model indicate that a plug flow reactor (PFR) will be the most efficient design for the oxidation reactor. As an alternative, the cascaded tank reactor system (CTR), in which the ozone feed may be realized with less practical problems, might be considered. The traditional continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CFSTR) is shown to be the least efficient system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sub-department of Environmental Technology, Wageningen University and Research Center, PO Box 8129, 6700 EV, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boncz", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bruning", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rulkens", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Energy Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Facility Design and Construction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12862212"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
