Neutrophil counts in BAL fluid increased at 3 and 24 h after exposure to ozone alone, but there were no further increases with ozone followed by OA exposure. Protein concentration was significantly increased in the ozone and OA groups at 3 and 24 h (163.4 +/- 25.6 and 128.7 +/- 7.4 mg/ml, respectively) compared to 54.0 +/- 18.1 mg/ml in the control group (p < 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively).", "Our data demonstrate an interaction of OA with ozone exposure on bronchial responsiveness; one underlying mechanism could be through damage at the endothelial-epithelial barrier."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College of Science, Technology & Medicine, London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int Arch Allergy Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9211652", "ISSNLinking": "1018-2438"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunization"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9030101", "10.1159/000237453"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
