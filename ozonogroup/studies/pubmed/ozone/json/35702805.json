According to the ASTM F 1980 standard, it has been determined that the nanoparticle liposome solution kept at 37 days and 55 oC in return for one-year stability preserves its effectiveness. Our study aimed to show that the newly developed solution maintains its effectiveness for a long time.", "In this study, a nanobubble ozone liposome solution containing 2% ZnCl2 was used. The aging tests were conducted according to the ASTM F 1980 [1] standards. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) level of the nanobubble ozone liposome solution with 2% ZnCl2 was determined as 1.562 ppm for strains of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) by the CLSI M07 A9 [2] standard test method. To assess the time-dependent antibacterial effect of the nanobubble liposome solution with 2% ZnCl2, the solution's efficiency at a concentration of 2000 ppm and for different time intervals was tested on strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (ATCC\u00ae 14028\u2122) and Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC\u00ae 7644\u2122).", "The results showed that the antibacterial activity of the strains of S. enterica subsp. enterica started at the end of the 10th minute and the solution was effective after 30 minutes. For strains of L. monocytogenes, it was observed that the activity started at the end of the 2nd minute and the product was effective after the 10th minute. According to the ASTM F 1980 standards, it was found that the nanobubble ozone liposome solution retained its effectiveness in one-year stability tests.", "As a result, the nanoparticle liposome solution, a new product, does not lose its stability and effectiveness for a long time, contrary to what is known. Although the half-life of gaseous ozone is as short as 20 minutes, the stability in the nanoparticle liposome solution has been determined as at least one year. Since nanoparticle liposome solution is a natural and slow-release product, nanobubble ozone liposome solution with 2% ZnCl2 may be used as a newly developed agent against contaminations in food processing facilities caused by biofilm-forming microorganisms through the use in disinfections of surfaces that are in direct contact with food products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bursa Uluda\u011f University, Vocational School of Health Services Med.
