Photochemical reactions with NO(x), CO and organic compounds are the main sources of O3 in the troposphere. In this work, an attempt was made to determine the impact of alkenes on the O3 concentration in the troposphere. A study on the gas-phase reactions of 03 with 1-hexene, 1-heptene and 1-nonene was made. The reactions were carried out at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. Ozone was formed by the ultraviolet radiation emitted by a mercury lamp, in order to simulate the atmospheric conditions. The changes with time in the concentration of O3, 1-alkenes and formed aldehydes were investigated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were done by means of the gas chromatography and colorimetry. The following products were identified: pentanal from 1-hexene; hexanal from 1-heptene; oktanal from 1-nonene. For each of the reactions, HCHO was also determined as a product. The reaction rate constants were calculated and obtained in units of 10(-17) cm(-3) molecule(-1) s(-1): 1.94-0.99 for 1-hexene, 5.54-4.51 for 1-heptene and 1.54-0.76 for 1-nonene. Based on the results obtained, an explanation of O3 concentration variations in the planetary boundary layer can be given. Last year a considerable increase of O3 concentration on the roads of Western Europe was recorded. This increase could have resulted from the decrease of alkene concentration in the air due to common use of the catalytic converters in cars. The unsaturated hydrocarbons rapidly oxidize on the catalyst. In Eastern Europe, where the amount of cars equipped with catalytic converters is smaller than in Western Europe, the alkene content in the exhaust fumes results in a decrease of the O3 concentration in the troposphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical University of Szczecin, Institute of Organic Chemical Technology, Al.
