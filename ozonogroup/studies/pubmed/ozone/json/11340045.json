(Karst.)) seedlings were exposed to ambient and elevated (1.5 x ambient in 1997 and 1.6 x ambient in 1998) ozone concentrations [O3] and three nitrogen (N) and two phosphorus (P) availabilities: \"optimal\" values (control); 70% of the control N and P values (LN and LP); and 150% of the control N value (HN). Treatments were applied in an open-field ozone fumigation facility during the 1997 and 1998 growing seasons. Effects on growth, mineral and pigment concentrations, stomatal conductance and ultrastructure of needles were studied. The HN treatment increased growth significantly, whereas elevated [O3] had a slight or variable impact on growth and biomass allocation in all N treatments. Although there were no significant effects of the LP treatment on plant growth during the second year, there was a reduction in 1-year-old shoot dry mass in the elevated O3 + LP treatment at the end of the experiment. There were no significant treatment effects on mineral concentrations of current-year and 1-year-old needles at the final harvest. In response to the HN treatment, chlorophyll a and b and carotenoid concentrations increased significantly in current-year needles. Chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased in response to elevated [O3] alone, but increased in seedlings in the O(3) + LP treatment. Stomatal conductance of current-year needles decreased with increasing N availability, but increased in response to elevated [O3]. However, the O3-induced increase in stomatal conductance was less in the LN and LP treatments than in the control treatment. In chloroplasts of current-year needles, increased N availability decreased mean starch grain area, but increased the number of plastoglobuli. We conclude that Norway spruce seedlings are relatively tolerant to slightly elevated [O3], and that nitrogen and phosphorus imbalances do not greatly affect the influence of O3 on this species when the exposure lasts for two growing seasons or less."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, P.O.
