The affecting factors on the degradation of EE(2) were studied and described in details, such as initial EE(2) concentration, initial pH value and ozone concentration. In addition, some parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, mineralization efficiency and degradation products were monitored during the process. The mineralization efficiency of EE(2) could reach 53.9%. During the ozonation process the rapid decrease of pH and the sharp increase of electrical conductivity indicated the formation of acidic by-products, small fragments and ions which were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Results showed that there were intermediate products of smaller molecule with higher polarity produced during the course of EE(2) degradation. Then a possible reaction pathway for EE(2) degradation involving all intermediates detected is proposed. During the ozonation process EE(2) was first oxidized into hydroxyl-semiquinone isomers which were subsequently degraded into low molecular weight compounds such as oxalic acid, malonate, glutarate, and so on. Furthermore, these organic acids are easily oxidized by ozone into carbon dioxide (CO(2)). This work shows that ozonation process is promising for the removal of EE(2). The results can provide some useful information for the potential treatment of EE(2) by ozonation in aqueous solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Science, Wuhan University, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Pengyu", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Nansheng", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiantong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "423D2T571U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethinyl Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethinyl Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16387433", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2005.10.026", "S0304-3894(05)00650-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
