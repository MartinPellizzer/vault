Domestic healthy dogs received dental scaling and polishing under general anesthesia. Under standard feeding and homecare during 7 days, 20 dogs were randomly placed into 2 different groups for dental treatment. The control group (CG) was given a single placebo application and the ozone group (O<sub>3</sub>G) received daily ozonized ointment application. The average age (CG = 4.4; O<sub>3</sub>G = 5.7 years old), body weight (CG = 15.7; O<sub>3</sub>G = 15.3 kg) and the gingivitis index obtained on the first day (D0) allowed initial homogeneity between the groups. The dental plaque index, including clinical and computerized analysis on the seventh day, was obtained from the buccal aspect of specific dental locations. Both analyses revealed significant statistical association between daily application of ozone and antiplaque effect. There was no evidence of toxicity during the study. These results suggest that ozone therapy may be an efficient adjuvant to conventional periodontal treatment in decreasing initial dental plaque formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7765-3021"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Abreu-Villela", "ForeName": "Paula", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ferraro", "ForeName": "Mario", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rodrigues", "ForeName": "Renata R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ferro", "ForeName": "Daniel G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Fantoni", "ForeName": "Denise T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Koh", "ForeName": "Ivan Hong Jun", "Initials": "IHJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gioso", "ForeName": "Marco Antonio", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial, Veterinary"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vet Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "9426426", "ISSNLinking": "0898-7564"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Plaque"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Plaque Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dog Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Gingivitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33942657", "10.1177/08987564211013920"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
