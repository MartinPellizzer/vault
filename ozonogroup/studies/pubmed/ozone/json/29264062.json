Therefore, to elucidate the reasons individuals with common colds do not use over-the-counter (OTC) medication, we conducted an investigation using a self-administered inquiry sheet to determine reasons for clinic visits and for the avoidance of OTC medication.", "The study was of patients with self-diagnosed common cold symptoms using an anonymous self-report questionnaire.", "Of the 471 patients administered the questionnaire, 442 responded. The analysis was focused on the 37 patients who responded that they had considered using OTC medication before coming to the clinic but decided against it and came to the clinic instead. The majority responded positively saying that they felt reassured when seen by a physician (91.9%) and that their common cold was cured more rapidly (89.2%).", "It can be presumed that many patients with common colds visit medical institutions because they feel reassured and feel that their symptoms improve at a quicker rate. The findings of this study indicated that there is a need for accurate information and relief from anxiety for patients regarding the common cold."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Himawari Home Clinic Sumino-kai Healthcare Corporation Chiba Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Primary Care and Medical Education Faculty of Medicine University of Tsukuba Tsukuba Japan."}], "LastName": "Tsutsumi", "ForeName": "Madoka", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Respiratory Medicine Department of Internal Medicine Nihon University School of Medicine Tokyo Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychosomatic Internal Medicine Nihon University Itabashi Hospital Tokyo Japan."}], "LastName": "Shaku", "ForeName": "Fumio", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Primary Care and Medical Education Faculty of Medicine University of Tsukuba Tsukuba Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Medicine and Primary Care University of Tsukuba Hospital Tsukuba Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Sachiko", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Primary Care and Medical Education Faculty of Medicine University of Tsukuba Tsukuba Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Medicine and Primary Care University of Tsukuba Hospital Tsukuba Japan."}], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Naoto", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Primary Care and Medical Education Faculty of Medicine University of Tsukuba Tsukuba Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Medicine and Primary Care University of Tsukuba Hospital Tsukuba Japan."}], "LastName": "Maeno", "ForeName": "Tetsuhiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Fam Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101689875", "ISSNLinking": "2189-7948"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Porteous T, Bond C, Hannaford P, et\u00a0al.
