Exposures occurred while exercising intermittently in a controlled metabolic chamber at the Human Studies Division, US EPA.", "In all, 23 healthy subjects between ages of 18 and 35 y.", "Subjects consumed a low fruit and vegetable diet for 3 weeks. After the first week, subjects underwent a sham exposure to filtered air with exercise, followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Subjects were randomly assigned into supplement (one can vegetable juice, vitamins C and E daily) or placebo (orange soda, placebo pill daily) groups for 2 weeks. After the 2-week intervention, subjects were exposed to 0.4 ppm (784 microg/m(3)) ozone for 2 h with exercise followed by BAL. Blood samples were drawn before, immediately after and 3 h postexposure on each exposure day. The concentrations of nine carotenoids were determined by HPLC in BAL macrophages and plasma samples.", "Plasma concentrations of all the carotenoids that were present in the vegetable juice (except cis-beta-carotene) increased significantly in the supplemented group. Lung macrophage alpha-carotene concentrations increased significantly, lycopene isomers increased slightly, and all other carotenoids decreased (nonsignificantly) in the supplementation group following the intervention. Ozone exposure resulted in decreases in several carotenoids in plasma of the placebo group, but not in the supplemented group.", "Lung macrophage concentrations of carotenoids can be manipulated by diet. Ozone is a potent environmental oxidant that appears to reduce plasma carotenoids in nonsupplemented individuals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. susan_scott@unc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steck-Scott", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arab", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Craft", "ForeName": "N E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samet", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8804070", "ISSNLinking": "0954-3007"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15127089", "10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601988", "1601988"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
