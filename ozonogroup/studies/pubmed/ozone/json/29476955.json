For the laboratory experiments, pairs of twin samples were collected in field and, after treatments favoring decomposition or/and volatilization of PAHs on one sample, the PAH amount was compared with that of the corresponding untreated sample. Ozone exposure caused a general PAHs decay with more marked effects on benzo [a]pyrene, perylene and benz [a]anthracene; these compounds showed, similarly to benzo [ghi]perylene, correlations between ozone dose and losses. Treatments with zero air exhibited losses due to volatilization even for 5-ring PAHs up to benzo [a]pyrene, whereas a linear dependence was observed between filter PAH load and losses for benzo [a]anthracene, chrysene and benzofluoranthenes. Concentrations on samples collected simultaneously over 48, 24, 12 and 6\u202fh were compared. Results confirmed a lack of temporal auto-consistency in the PAHs sampling methodology here adopted. In particular higher atmospheric PAH concentrations were ascertained on samples constituted by cumulative filters exposed over shorter sampling times. When 24-h and 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f12-h samples were compared, comparable losses were evaluated in the hot and cold seasons. This finding shows that, although in summer meteorology conditions favor sampling artifacts, the effectiveness of these phenomena continue in the winter, probably due to the larger amount of PAH available on the sampling filter (total PAHs\u202f\u223c\u202f10 vs 0.5\u202fng\u202fm<sup>-3</sup>)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
