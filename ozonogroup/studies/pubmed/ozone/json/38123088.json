However, due to the uncertainties in commonly used Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) and statistical models, accurately assessing O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> in China is challenging. In this study, we calculated the O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> concentrations with the CTM - Brute Force Method (BFM) and constrained the results with site observations of O<sub>3</sub> with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The annual average O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> concentration in China region in 2020 is 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0ppb, accounting for 81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0% of the maximum 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>). We applied the random forest and Shapley additive explanations based on meteorological standardization techniques to separate the contributions of meteorology and natural emissions to O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub>. Natural emissions contribute more significantly to O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> than meteorology in various Chineses regions (30-40\u00a0ppb), with higher contributions during the warm season. Meteorological factors show higher contributions in the spring and summer seasons (2-3\u00a0ppb) than the other seasons. Temperature and humidity are the primary contributors to O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> in regions with severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China, with their individual impacts ranging from 30\u00a0% to 62\u00a0% of the total impacts of all meteorological factors in different seasons. For policy implications, we tracked the contributions of O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> and local photochemical reaction contributions (O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>LC</sub>) to total O<sub>3</sub> concentration at different O<sub>3</sub> levels. We found that O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>LC</sub> contribute over 45\u00a0% to MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> on polluted days, supporting the current Chinese policy of reducing O<sub>3</sub> peak concentrations by cutting down precursor emissions. However, as the contribution of O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> is not considered in the policy, additional efforts are needed to achieve the control groal of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. As the implementation of stringent O<sub>3</sub> control measurements in China, the contribution of O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> become increasingly significant, suggesting the need for attention to O<sub>3</sub>_<sub>RBG</sub> and regional joint prevention and control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
