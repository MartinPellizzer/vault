Likewise, the Fenton process is a classic wastewater treatment method, but requires strict pH control and produces secondary pollution when the concentration of organic substances is high. In this study, we applied a 1stO<sub>3</sub>-2ndFenton sequential process to treat diazodinitrophenol (DDNP) industrial wastewater and provide suitable reaction conditions for Fenton process. For the 1stOzone process, organics removal increased as O<sub>3</sub> dosage increased. At optimized operation, the 1stO<sub>3</sub> process provided an acidic effluent (pH = 3) and reduced the organics concentration to a level suitable for the 2ndFenton process. Benzene ring substances as well as nitro group and diazo group compounds were greatly degraded in the 1stO<sub>3</sub> process and were further mineralized in the 2ndFenton process. Additionally, the biodegradability of DDNP industrial wastewater was greatly improved. This is the first reported time that ozonation and the Fenton process have been integrated sequentially to treat an explosive production wastewater. The study provides a feasible chemical oxidation method for treating DDNP industrial wastewater by simply combining two classic treatment processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, 610066, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Zhepei", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 611756, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Xuqin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 611756, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shengpeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, 610066, China. apzhang@sicnu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Aiping", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "201810636068", "Agency": "China's National Students' Platform for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2019 Feb 5;363:99-108", "ArticleIdList": ["30308370"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2019 Jun 18;53(12):6917-6926", "ArticleIdList": ["31050416"]}, {"Citation": "Waste Manag. 2019 Feb 15;85:283-294", "ArticleIdList": ["30803582"]}, {"Citation": "Water Sci Technol. 2018 Dec;78(9):1861-1870", "ArticleIdList": ["30566090"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2018 Aug 5;355:136-144", "ArticleIdList": ["29783154"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2018 Mar 1;130:127-138", "ArticleIdList": ["29216480"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2019 Jan;215:82-91", "ArticleIdList": ["30316160"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2015 Oct 30;297:261-8", "ArticleIdList": ["25978189"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31522395", "10.1007/s11356-019-06469-0", "10.1007/s11356-019-06469-0"]}}]}
