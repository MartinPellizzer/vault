In a general manner, the lamps of a UV/O<sub>3</sub> generator create two different wavelengths (\u03bb = 185 and 254 nm); the shorter wavelength (\u03bb = 185 nm) dissociates the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in air and the longer wavelength (\u03bb = 254 nm) dissociates the O<sub>3</sub> and creates the reactive and monoatomic oxygen radical, which tends to incorporate onto the defects of the carbons. By tailoring the association and dissociation of the oxygen with various forms, carbon black, carbon nanofibers, and graphite flakes, chosen as representative models for the zero-, one-, and two-dimensional carbon frameworks, their structure can be oxidized, respectively, which is known as photochemical oxidation. Various carbons have their own distinctive morphology and electron transport properties, which are applicable for the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cell. We, here, report on the improvement of electrochemical performance of the lithium/sulfur cell through such an efficient functionalization approach."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jungjin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Materials Analysis, Korea Basic Science Institute, 169-148 Gwahak Road, Daejeon 34133, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "Joonhee", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kookhan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak Road, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ri", "ForeName": "Vitalii", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mobile Communications Business, Samsung Electronics, Suwon 16677, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sangheon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8355-8875"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Byung Hee", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1563-8328"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Sung", "ForeName": "Yung-Eun", "Initials": "YE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak Road, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Chunjoong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1179-7591"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Cairns", "ForeName": "Elton J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34428892", "10.1021/acsami.1c07452"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
