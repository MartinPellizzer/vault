Independent of the oxidation process assessed, the decomposition of imazethapyr always followed a pseudo-first order kinetic. The direct UV-irradiation (UV) of the herbicide as well as its oxidation with ozone (O\u2083), and hydrogen peroxide tied to UV-irradiation (H\u2082O\u2082/UV) were sufficiently slow to permit the identification of intermediate products, the formation pathway of which has been proposed. Ozonation joined to UV-irradiation (O\u2083/UV), ozonation joined to titanium dioxide photo-catalysis (TiO\u2082/UV+O\u2083), sole photo-catalysis (TiO\u2082/UV), and photo-catalysis reinforced with hydrogen peroxide-oxidation (TiO\u2082/UV+H\u2082O\u2082) were characterized by a faster degradation and rapid formation of a lot of small molecules, which were quickly degraded to complete mineralization. The most effective oxidation methods were those using titanium dioxide photo-catalysis enhanced either by ozonation or hydrogen peroxide. Most of all, these last processes were useful to avoid the development of dangerous by-products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Farm Organization & Management, University of Ioannina, Agrinio, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stathis", "ForeName": "Ioannis", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hela", "ForeName": "Dimitra G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scrano", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lelario", "ForeName": "Filomena", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emanuele", "ForeName": "Lucia", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bufo", "ForeName": "Sabino A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "72T2IN94I4", "NameOfSubstance": "imazethapyr"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotinic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21726140", "10.1080/03601234.2011.583834"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
