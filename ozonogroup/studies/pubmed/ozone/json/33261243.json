While other ambient air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide showed decreasing trends in mean annual concentrations, ozone concentrations have not declined recently in most countries across the world. Short-term exposure to high concentrations of ozone has been associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity in many regions of the world. However, the long-term effects of ozone have been less investigated than the short-term exposure due to the difficulty in modeling ozone exposure and linking between individual exposures and health outcome data. A recently developed model of ozone exposure enabled the investigation of long-term ozone effects on health outcomes. Recent findings suggested that long-term exposure to ozone was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Longitudinal studies using large cohorts also revealed that long-term exposure to ozone was associated with a greater decline in lung function and the progression of emphysema. The development of long-term standards for ozone as well as PM should be considered to protect the respiratory health of the general population and people with chronic respiratory diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Control and Population Health, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sun-Young", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Environmental Health Center, Kangwon National University School of Medicine, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Esther", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Environmental Health Center, Kangwon National University School of Medicine, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Woo Jin", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul)", "NlmUniqueID": "101479418", "ISSNLinking": "1738-3536"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflicts of Interest</b>.
