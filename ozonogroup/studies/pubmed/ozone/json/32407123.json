Furthermore, bubble generation from the plastron-like honeycomb gas chamber by attaching oil droplet onto the surface of honeycomb films was first observed. Both controlling gas bubbles and oil droplets underwater are important issues in the field of microfluidics since they are useful and may solve the maleficence to liquid transportation in narrow microchannels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, 6-3, Aramaki-Aza-Aoba, Aoba-Ku, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Bihai", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials (IMRAM), Tohoku University, 2-1-1, Katahira, Aoba-Ku, Sendai 980-8577, Japan."}], "LastName": "Wada", "ForeName": "Takehiko", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1943-6790"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "WPI-Advanced Institute for Materials Research (AIMR), Tohoku University, 2-1-1, Katahira, Aoba-Ku, Sendai 980-8577, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yabu", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32407123", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c00427"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
