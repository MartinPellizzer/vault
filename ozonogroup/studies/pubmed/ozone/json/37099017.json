In order to mitigate such micropollutants, ozonation is one of the most commonly employed advanced treatment processes. Current research regarding ozone efficiency is heavily focusing on reaction mechanisms of different contaminant groups, including structures with amine moieties as reactive sites. This study analyzes pH-dependent reaction kinetics and pathways of gabapentin (GBP), an aliphatic primary amine with an additional carboxylic acid group. The transformation pathway was elucidated applying a novel approach using isotopically labeled ozone (<sup>18</sup>O) and quantum chemistry calculations. While the direct reaction of GBP with ozone is highly pH-dependent and slow at pH 7 (13.7 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), the rate constant of the deprotonated species (1.76 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) is comparable to those of other amine compounds. Pathway analysis based on LC-MS/MS measurements revealed that ozonation of GBP leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid group and simultaneous nitrate formation, which was also observed in the case of the aliphatic amino acid glycine. Nitrate was formed with a yield of approximately 100%. Experiments with <sup>18</sup>O-labeled ozone demonstrated that the intermediate aldehyde does most likely not include any oxygen originating from ozone. Furthermore, quantum chemistry calculations did not provide an explanation for the C-N scission during GBP ozonation without ozone involvement, although this reaction was slightly more favorable than for respective glycine and ethylamine reactions. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms of aliphatic primary amines during wastewater ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Urban Water Systems Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Am Coulombwall 3, 85748 Garching, Germany."}], "LastName": "Bein", "ForeName": "Emil", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5976-6295"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Urban Water Systems Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Am Coulombwall 3, 85748 Garching, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sierra Olea", "ForeName": "Millaray", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Urban Water Systems Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Am Coulombwall 3, 85748 Garching, Germany."}], "LastName": "Petersen", "ForeName": "Sophie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2520-7596"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Urban Water Systems Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Am Coulombwall 3, 85748 Garching, Germany."}], "LastName": "Drewes", "ForeName": "J\u00f6rg E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2547-6366"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Urban Water Systems Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Am Coulombwall 3, 85748 Garching, Germany."}], "LastName": "H\u00fcbner", "ForeName": "Uwe", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6CW7F3G59X", "NameOfSubstance": "Gabapentin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE7660XO1C", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gabapentin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37099017", "10.1021/acs.est.2c06709"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
