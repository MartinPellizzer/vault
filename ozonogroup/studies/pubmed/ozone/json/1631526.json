Although the concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) in the raw water varied substantially over the study period, parameters measuring the biodegradability and reactivity to chlorine of the NOM were closely correlated to the NOM concentration. As a result of treatment including ozonation and adsorption, two patterns of response emerged. Some parameters decreased through each step of the treatment process while others usually increased following ozonation and then decreased through subsequent steps. The levels of this latter group were decreased by biological activity in the filters (except for one treatment stream) and further reduced in the biologically active granular activated carbon (GAC) contactors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huck", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fedorak", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alberta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1631526", "10.1016/0048-9697(92)90117-b", "0048-9697(92)90117-B"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
