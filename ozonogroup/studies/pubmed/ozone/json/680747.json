Purified IV contained a compound with the same GC retention time as authentic II on OV-17 and Silar 10C columns, using a FID or a nitrogen/phosphorus detector. The GC-coupled mass spectra contained major peaks at m/e 251 and 167 and the GC-coupled methane CI spectra gave the quasi-molecular ion, m/e 282. However, the CI selected ion monitor indicated three compounds at m/e 282. The nitrosamine II was separated from IV by HPLC on muBondapak C18. The GC-coupled mass spectra of the HPLC nitrosamine fraction had peaks at m/e 251 and 167 and other peaks for a compound of greater MW than II, although the GC retention times were the same. Evidence for II and a decrease in the detection limit to one ppm was obtained with a TEA interfaced with a HPLC. To determine if II was formed from IV, it was exposed to ozone at -78 degrees C in methylene chloride. The DSC, IR and NMR of the product were coincident with those of the standard of II. In other experiments, IV in methylene chloride was exposed to light and dry air in the presence and absence of methylene blue. The PMR and 13C NMR of the product formed in the presence of methylene blue were the same as that of II. It is postulated that this nitrosamine was formed by a singlet oxygen mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schoenhard", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aksamit", "ForeName": "W W", "Initials": "WW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bible", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "L C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hribar", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Levon", "ForeName": "E F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shubeck", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "IARC Sci Publ (1971)", "NlmUniqueID": "0364347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Piperazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["680747"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
