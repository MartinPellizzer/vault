In this study, an electro-dissolved ozone flotation (E-DOF) was established, in which dissolved ozone flotation (DOF) and electro-coagulation (EC) occurred concurrently in one unit and integrated with anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactor (A/O-MBR) to dispose leachate from a WTS. In the integrated reactor, E-DOF acted as pretreatment and advanced treatment unit. A/O-MBR acted as secondary treatment unit. The E-DOF pretreatment achieved 34.48% COD and 16.96% NH<sub>3</sub>-N removal efficiency through synergistic effect between EC and DOF. BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD of leachate was increased from 0.32 to 0.51 after E-DOF pretreatment, indicating the enhancement of biodegradability. Molecular weight distribution (MWD) and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) analysis demonstrate that the reduction of molecular weight and elimination of refractory organics through EC, ozone, and their interacted product (\u2022OH) are attributed to biodegradability enhancement in lechate. Microbial community analysis proved that chemoheterotrophy and oxic chemoheterotrophy functions, mainly provided by Truepera, Aquamicrobium, Saprospiraceae, and Lentimicrobiaceae, ensured the efficient degradation of organic in the secondary processes. E-DOF advanced treatment effectively\u00a0disposed residual contaminant in MBR effluent. The E-DOF advanced treatment mainly disposed residual contaminant in MBR effluent. High removal efficiency of COD (98.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27%), NH<sub>3</sub>-N (95.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50%), TN (95.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73%), and TP (96.75\u2009\u00b1\u20091.66%) were observed in the integrated reactor, and final effluent met the discharge standards for inclusion in the sewage pipe network in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
