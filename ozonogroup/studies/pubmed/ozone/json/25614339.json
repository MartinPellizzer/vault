The study population comprised 2941 non-smoking children who completed pulmonary function tests at both baseline and follow-up surveys. We applied spatial modeling for individual-level exposure assessment to capture relevant exposures and also attempted to eliminate potential community-level confounding. The exposure parameters were annual averages and values calculated from 24-hourly PM2.5 and 8-hourly ozone (O3) concentrations, corresponding to the residential addresses over the study period. The effect estimates were presented as lung function growth deficits per interquartile range (IQR) for PM2.5 and O3.", "In a multiple linear mixed effect model, adjusted for confounding, growth deficits in the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiration volume in 1s (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the FVC were associated with increased exposure to PM2.5 and O3. For example, greater exposure to PM2.5 (IQR, 17.92\u03bcg/m(3)) was associated with an annual deficit in FVC growth of 75mL in boys and 61mL in girls (p for interaction <0.05). Similar associations were found for O3.", "The study provides evidence that long-term exposure to PM2.5 and O3 may have a detrimental effect on the development of lung function in children. The estimated deficits were generally larger in boys, compared to girls."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.
