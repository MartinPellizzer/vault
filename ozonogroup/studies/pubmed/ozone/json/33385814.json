In this study, a maize cultivar with the largest acreage in China was exposed to two O<sub>3</sub> treatments (NF: ambient air O<sub>3</sub> concentration; NF60: NF plus 60\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub>) and four N levels (farmers' N practice: 240\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>; 150%, 50% and 25% of farmers' N practice). Generally, O<sub>3</sub> and N significantly influenced biomass, N and C, but did not change their allocation to kernel. There were significant interactions between O<sub>3</sub> and N in stem biomass, C concentration and uptake, and leaf biomass and C uptake, with significant O<sub>3</sub> effects mainly occurring at N120 and N240. Based on the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), root C:N ratio rather than the most commonly used leaf C:N ratio was the best trait to indicate maize productivity. Furthermore, O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased the regression slopes between root C:N ratio and kernel N uptake, kernel C uptake and plant N uptake, strengthened the correlation of C:N ratio and kernel C uptake, and weakened the correlation of C:N ratio and hundred-kernels weight. These suggest that O<sub>3</sub> pollution can change the relationship of C:N ratio and productivity in maize. The weak correlation between kernel harvest index (HI) and N harvest index (NHI) indicated that future breeding researches should consider how to improve the coupling between biomass and N-related nutrition allocations in crop edible parts. Our results not only are helpful to accurately estimate O<sub>3</sub> impacts on maize with consideration of N but also provide a new insight into the relationship between plant traits and its productivity under O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
