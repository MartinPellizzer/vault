Additionally, two advanced processes of oxidation were applied i.e. with a use of a UV light/H2O2/air and UV light/H2O2/O3/air. These two processes were compared for their efficiency to the direct oxidation process where ozone is used in the absence of UV light. Results obtained for both advanced processes showed better oxidation than takes place by ozone in the absence of UV light. After the photooxidation processes, different processes for the absorption or precipitation of sulfates were investigated to comply with the World Health Organization (WHO) norm that demands a limit of < or =250 mg L(-1) of SO4(2-) in drinking water. Additionally, reverse osmosis was simulated using Osmonics Inc. software to predict the feasibility of lowering the salt concentration below WHO limits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Ciencias, Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla, Ciudad Universitaria, Puebla, M\u00e9xico. fhernand@siu.buap.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Fernando", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geissler", "ForeName": "Gunther", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "World Health Organization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15745428", "10.1562/2004-12-13-RA-401", "2004-12-13-RA-401"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
