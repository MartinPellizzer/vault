By analyzing the chemical composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the inlet and outlet of the vapor processing device, the ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP) were estimated by maximum incremental reaction (MIR) and fractional aerosol coefficients (FAC), and the secondary pollution formation contribution of VOCs were quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that:\u2460 the <i>\u03c1</i>(total volatile organic compounds, TVOC) at the inlet and outlet of the vapor processing device were 436-706 g\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 4.98-10.04 g\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Alkanes (72%\u00b14%), oxygenated organics (14%\u00b12%), and olefins (11%\u00b15%) were the dominant components of VOCs emissions. There were little differences in VOCs emissions from the different vapor processing devices; the key species were i-pentane (approximately 25%), followed by n-butane, i-butane, and n-pentane. \u2461 The ozone source reactivity (SR) of VOCs emissions from the outlet of the vapor processing device was 2.6-3.3 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>, and the OFP was 3.5-25.6 g\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Olefins contributed the most (43%-69%), followed by alkanes (20%-35%) and oxygenated organics (10%-22%). Butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, i-pentane, and propionaldehyde were the species that highly contributed to OFP. \u2462 Aromatics in VOCs emissions contributed the most to SOAP (80%-92%), and the main active species were toluene, 1, 2, 4-trimethylbenzene, 1, 3, 5-trimethylbenzene, and <i>p</i>-diethylbenzene. The research showed that different VOCs species emitted by the vapor processing device contributed obvious differences to the secondary atmospheric pollution, and butene species and aromatics such as toluene were the focus of VOCs emission control of vehicle gasoline and vapor processing device."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Faculty of Environment and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Control Technology and Applications, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Control Technology and Applications, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu-Hu", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Faculty of Environment and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Wen-Jun", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Vehicle Emission Management Center, Beijing 100176, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming-Yu", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Control Technology and Applications, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Tian-Yi", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Control Technology and Applications, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Bi-Qi", "Initials": "BQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36775595", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202202049"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
