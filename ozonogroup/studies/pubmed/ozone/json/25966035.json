Corn mash (200 g) was prepared from POET ground corn and POET corn slurry and was ozonated in 250 mL polypropylene bottles. Lactic and acetic acid levels were monitored daily during the fermentation of ozonated, aerated, and nontreated corn mash samples to evaluate bacterial activity. Glycerol and ethanol contents of fermentation samples were checked daily to assess yeast activity. No yeast supplementation, no addition of other antimicrobial agents (such as antibiotics), and spiking with a common lactic acid bacterium found in corn ethanol plants, Lactobacillus plantarum, amplified the treatment effects. The laboratory-scale ozone dosages ranged from 26-188 mg/L, with very low estimated costs of $0.0008-0.006/gal ($0.21-1.6/m(3)) of ethanol. Ozonation was found to decrease the initial pH of ground corn mash samples, which could reduce the sulfuric acid required to adjust the pH prior to ethanol fermentation. Lactic and acetic acid levels tended to be lower for samples subjected to increasing ozone dosages, indicating less bacterial activity. The lower ozone dosages in the range applied achieved higher ethanol yields. Preliminary experiments on ozonating POET corn slurry at low ozone dosages were not as effective as using POET ground corn, possibly because corn slurry samples contained recycled antimicrobials from the backset. The data suggest additional dissolved and suspended organic materials from the backset consumed the ozone or shielded the bacteria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rasmussen", "ForeName": "Mary L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koziel", "ForeName": "Jacek A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jane", "ForeName": "Jay-lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u22a5Department of Food, Nutrition, and Packaging Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina 29634, United States."}], "LastName": "Pometto", "ForeName": "Anthony L", "Initials": "AL", "Suffix": "3rd"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25966035", "10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00563"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
