Exposure limits and testing methods for major atmospheric pollutants (particulate matter or dust, ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide) are set by relevant standards in workplace air, ambient air and indoor air. However, due to different places and different management departments, there are differences in the detection methods of the same indicators, which brings difficulties to estimate the total daily exposure level. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the \"consistency\" of the detection method of relevant pollutants in the air, in order to provide scientific basis for estimating the daily exposure level of pollutants in different populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "81872590", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation Item of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018.19", "Agency": "Tianjin Health Industry High-level Talents Jinmen Medical Talents Special Project", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8410840", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9391"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workplace"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32447898", "10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20190304-00082"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
