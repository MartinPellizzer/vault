Therefore, it is of great significance to find a universal relationship between reaction rate and certain parameters of several diverse organic pollutants. In this study, removal ratio and kinetics of 33 kinds of organic substances were investigated by ozonation process, including azo dyes, heterocyclic compounds, ionic compounds and so on. Most quantum chemical parameters were conducted by using Gaussian 09 at the DFT B3LYP/6-311G level, including \u03bc, q H(+), q(C)minq(C)max, ELUMO and EHOMO. Other descriptors, bond order (BO) as well as Fukui indices (f(+), f(-) and f(0)), were calculated by Material Studio 6.1 at Dmol(3)/GGA-BLYP/DNP(3.5) basis for each organic compound. The recommended model for predicting rate constants was lnk'=1.978-95.484f(0)x-3.350q(C)min+38.221f(+)x, which had the squared regression coefficient R(2)=0.763 and standard deviation SD=0.716. The results of t test and the Fisher test suggested that the model exhibited optimum stability. Also, the model was validated by internal and external validations. Recommended QSAR model showed that the highest f(0) value of main-chain carbons (f(0)x) is more closely related to lnk' than other quantum descriptors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
