In this work, the inactivation of E. coli K12, acid-adapted E. coli K12, and E. coli O157:H7 in apple cider by ACP was investigated using feed gases as simulated air (SA) (80\u00a0% N<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a020\u00a0% O<sub>2</sub>) and a mixture of 90\u00a0% N<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a010\u00a0% O<sub>2</sub> with various processing times (0 to 180\u00a0s). We obtained the reduced the populations of both acid-adapted and non-adapted E. coli K12 by 5\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/mL within 120\u00a0s, and E. coli O157:H7 within 90\u00a0s. Additionally, no significant changes in the \u00b0Brix, pH, temperature, or titratable acidity (TA) of apple cider were observed after exposure to ACP. However, processing times longer than 120\u00a0s resulted in significant changes in the pH values. The highest concentration of ozone and hydrogen peroxide reached to 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mg/L for CG in 180\u00a0s and 0.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mg/L for SA in 150\u00a0s, respectively. Both acid-adapted and non-acid adapted E. coli K12 was found to be more resistant to ACP processing than E. coli O157:H7 after the 90\u00a0s, so it could serve as a surrogate for E. coli O157:H7. When we compared the effect of the gas type on inactivation, non-selective media, the results showed no significant differences between the gas types, while selective media demonstrated significant differences. In optical absorption spectroscopy measurements of plasma species, primarily ozone peaks were observed. Furthermore, the optical absorption spectroscopy also revealed that the inactivation of the bacteria could be attributed to some plasma species with wavelengths between 190 and 308\u00a0nm. The findings provided a perspective on the use of ACP as a method for decontaminating fruit juices as a non-thermal processing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
