To investigate the characteristics and temporal variations of VOCs mass concentration levels, the online monitoring data of ozone \uff08O<sub>3</sub>\uff09 and PM<sub>2.5</sub> at the same site were also collected. Subsequently, the ozone formation potential \uff08OFP\uff09 and secondary organic aerosol formation potential \uff08SOAFP\uff09 were utilized to assess the chemical activity of VOCs. Additionally, the potential source areas of VOCs in spring in Shijiazhuang were further identified using the potential source contribution factor \uff08PSCF\uff09 method and concentration weight trajectory analysis \uff08CWT\uff09. Hence, the major VOCs sources were evaluated with the VOCs initial mixing ratio. The results demonstrated that the averaged concentration of VOCs during the polluted period and clean period of spring in Shijiazhuang were 191.17 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 122.18 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Meanwhile, the OFP was 361.23 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> during the polluted period and 266.96 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> during the clean period, whereas the SOAFP was 1.98 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 1.61 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Therefore, effective control of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene \uff08BTEX\uff09 is crucial for reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Based on the results obtained from weight PSCF and CWT, the potential source areas of VOCs were further identified to be primarily located in the eastern Yuhua District, the high-tech district, and the northern Luancheng District of Shijiazhuang. These areas were influenced not only by local emissions but also by transport from neighboring regions, in which consistency between the CWT and PSCF results further supported these findings. Furthermore, the results obtained from the benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene \uff08B/T/E\uff09 and xylene/benzene \uff08X/B\uff09 ratios indicated that the main sources of VOCs in Shijiazhuang in spring were vehicle exhaust sources and burning sources, leading to a more serious air mass aging phenomenon. Hence, controlling vehicle emissions and implementing regional cooperative measures are the effective strategies for optimizing the air quality of Shijiazhuang."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yu-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chen-Qiang", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shun-Xin", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "He-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Pollution Prevention Biotechnology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Da-Xi", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CECEP Talroad Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Sai-Sai", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Yuhong Project Management Consulting Co., Ltd., Shijiazhuang 050035, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Pollution Prevention Biotechnology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jian-Sheng", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Key Laboratory of Pollution Prevention Biotechnology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shuang-Jiang", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Geographical Sciences, Hebei Academy of Sciences, Shijiazhuang 050011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Technology Innovation Center for Geographic Information Application, Shijiazhuang 050011, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun-Xia", "Initials": "YX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39168666", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202307088"]}}]}
