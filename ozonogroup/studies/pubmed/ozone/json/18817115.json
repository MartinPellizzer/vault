To evaluate threats to natural resources and historic rock paintings in remote Hells Canyon, Oregon and Idaho, deposition of ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at five stations along 60 km of the Snake River valley floor were passively sampled from July 2002 through June 2003, and ozone data and particulate chemistry were obtained from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) station at Hells Canyon. NH3 concentrations were high; biweekly averages peaked at 5-19 ppb in spring and summer and the nutrient-laden Snake River is a likely source. Fine particulate ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) averaged 2.6 microg/m3 during the 20% of worst visibility days with winter drainage of air masses from the Snake River Basin and possibly long distance transport from southern California. Other pollutants were within background ranges. NH3 is corrosive to clay-based pictographs; nitrogen deposition can alter natural biotic communities and terrestrial ecosystem processes at levels reported here."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Air Resource Management Program, Corvallis, OR 97339-1148, USA. lgeiser@fs.fed.us"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geiser", "ForeName": "Linda H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ingersoll", "ForeName": "Anne R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bytnerowicz", "ForeName": "Andrzej", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Copeland", "ForeName": "Scott A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YY9FVM7NSN", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oregon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18817115", "10.3155/1047-3289.58.9.1223"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
