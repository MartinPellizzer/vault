Models such as i-Tree Eco enable decision-making by quantifying effects associated with particular tree species. Of specific concern are emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, particularly isoprene, that contribute to the formation of photochemical smog and ground level ozone. Few studies have quantified these potential disservices of urban trees, and current models predominantly use emissions data from trees that differ from those in our target region of subtropical Australia. The present study aimed (i) to quantify isoprene emission rates of three tree species that together represent 16% of the inventoried street trees in the target region; (ii) to evaluate outputs of the i-Tree Eco model using species-specific versus currently used, generic isoprene emission rates; and (iii) to evaluate the findings in the context of regional air quality. Isoprene emission rates of (Myrtaceae) and (Proteaceae) were 2.61 and 2.06 \u00b5g g dry leaf weight h, respectively, whereas (Sapindaceae) was a nonisoprene emitter. We substituted the generic isoprene emission rates with these three empirical values in i-Tree Eco, resulting in a 182 kg yr (97%) reduction in isoprene emissions, totaling 6284 kg yr when extrapolated to the target region. From these results we conclude that care has to be taken when using generic isoprene emission factors for urban tree models. We recommend that emissions be quantified for commonly planted trees, allowing decision-makers to select tree species with the greatest overall benefit for the urban environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dunn-Johnston", "ForeName": "Kristina A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kreuzwieser", "ForeName": "J\u00fcrgen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hirabayashi", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Plant", "ForeName": "Lyndal", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rennenberg", "ForeName": "Heinz", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "Susanne", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Qual", "NlmUniqueID": "0330666", "ISSNLinking": "0047-2425"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butadienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0A62964IBU", "NameOfSubstance": "isoprene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Butadienes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26828179", "10.2134/jeq2015.01.0051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
