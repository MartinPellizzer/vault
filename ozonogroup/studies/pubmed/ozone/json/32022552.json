In the present study, we conducted a nationwide time-series analysis in 128 counties from 2013-2018 to examine whether temperature modifies the association between short-term ozone exposure with nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality in China. First, we analyzed the effects of ozone exposure on mortality at different temperature levels. Then, we calculated the pooled effects through a meta-analysis across China. We found that high-temperature conditions (>75th percentile in each county) significantly enhanced the effects of ozone on nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, with increases of 0.44% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36 and 0.51%), 0.42% (95% CI: 0.32 and 0.51%) and 0.50% (95% CI: 0.31 and 0.68%), respectively, for a 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in ozone at high temperatures. Stronger effects on nonaccidental and cardiovascular mortality were observed at high temperatures among elderly individuals aged 65 years and older compared with the younger people. Our findings provide evidence that health damage because of ozone may be influenced by the impacts of increasing temperatures, which point to the importance of mitigating ozone exposure in China under the context of climate change to further reduce the public health burden."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Wanying", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Qinghua", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3219-1422"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhiying", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiaonan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tiantian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7071-571X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xiaoming", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32022552", "10.1021/acs.est.9b05978"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
