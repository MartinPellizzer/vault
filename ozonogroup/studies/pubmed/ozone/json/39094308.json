Ag-Hollandite is a capable solution, but its facile synthesis still lacks systematic investigation. In this study, Ag-Hollandite catalysts were prepared using AgMnO<sub>4</sub> as the precursor by reflux (AMO-Re), hydrothermal (AMO-HT), and homogeneous (AMO-HR) methods, respectively. The as-prepared samples showed excellent stability under moisture conditions, with the optimal one maintaining an O<sub>3</sub> conversion rate of 99.19\u00a0% after 100\u00a0h. In the characterization results, Ramsdellite (R-MnO<sub>2</sub>) was identified as an intermediate species in the synthesis. AMO-HR exhibits higher activity due to enhanced active site exposure and weakened adsorption towards *OO species, while reduced surface hydroxyl content was a crucial factor for moisture resistance. This study aims to contribute insights for preparing catalysts by a facile method."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
