The SA is determined by electrochemically measuring the number of coulombs of charge passed during the reduction of surface Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> following Au NS oxidation in HClO<sub>4</sub>, whereas V is determined by electrochemically measuring the coulombs of charge passed during the complete oxidative dissolution of all of the Au in the Au NSs in the presence of Br<sup>-</sup> to form aqueous soluble AuBr<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. Assuming a spherical geometry and taking into account the total number of Au NSs on the electrode surface, the SA/ V is theoretically equal to 3/radius. A plot of the electrochemically measured SA/ V versus 1/radius for five different-sized Au NSs is linear with a slope of 1.8 instead of the expected value of 3. Following attachment of the Au NSs to the electrode and ozone treatment, the plot of SA/ V versus 1/radius is linear with a slope of 3.5, and the size based on electrochemistry matches very closely with those measured by scanning electron microscopy. We believe the ozone cleans the Au NS surface, allowing a more accurate measurement of the SA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Louisville , Louisville , Kentucky 40292 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Jay N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Louisville , Louisville , Kentucky 40292 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pattadar", "ForeName": "Dhruba K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Louisville , Louisville , Kentucky 40292 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mainali", "ForeName": "Badri P", "Initials": "BP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Louisville , Louisville , Kentucky 40292 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0685-0180"], "LastName": "Zamborini", "ForeName": "Francis P", "Initials": "FP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29926722", "10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01905"]}}]}
