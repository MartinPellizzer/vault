However, conventional fixed environmental monitoring stations are sparsely located and, despite environmental models, cannot adequately assess individual exposure levels. New forms of low-cost portable monitors have begun to emerge that enable the collection of higher spatial density \"crowd sourced\" data; however, the first generation of these low-cost environmental monitors have generally not been suitable for clinical environmental health studies due to practical challenges such as calibration, reproducibility, form factor, and battery life. In this paper, we present a wearable environmental monitor that overcomes these challenges and can be used in clinical studies The new device, called \"Eco-Mini,\" can be used without a smart phone and is capable of locally sampling and recording a variety of environmental parameters (Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds, humidity, temperature, ambient light color balance, and sound level) as well as individual activity (3-axis accelerometer) and location (GPS). In this paper, we also report findings and discuss lessons learned from a feasibility study conducted for one week with pediatric patients as part of an ongoing asthma research study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fletcher", "ForeName": "Richard Rib\u00f3n", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oreskovic", "ForeName": "Nicolas M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "Alyssa I", "Initials": "AI"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K23 HL103841", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "101763872", "ISSNLinking": "2375-7477"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Phone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "World Health Organization (WHO)  7 Million Premature Deaths Annually Linked to Air Pollution. 2014 Mar; [Online].
