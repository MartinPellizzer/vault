Karst. plants were treated with ozone (100 microm(-3) plus peaks of 130 to 360 microm(-3)) and acid mist (pH 3.0) during two vegetation periods. Pulse labelling experiments on shoots were performed with [(35)S]methionine in the second year of exposure. Extraction of soluble needle proteins in citric acid buffer of pH 2.8 revealed protein patterns on SDS polyacrylamide gels that differed from those of control needles fumigated with ambient levels of ozone (50 microg m(-3)) and mist of pH 5.6. New proteins of MW 16000 and 32000 were synthesized only in ozone-exposed needles and could not be detected in the controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute f\u00fcr Biochemische Pflanzenpathologie, GSF Munich, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstrabetae 1, D-8042 Neuherberg, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmitt", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandermann", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092292", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90058-k", "0269-7491(90)90058-K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
