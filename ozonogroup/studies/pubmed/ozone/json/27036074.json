Thiol adsorption occurs in all cases via Cu-S bond formation, with partial dissolution of CuO at 75 \u00b0C and formation of a copper-thiolate complex replacement layer. Regardless of temperature, the surface of the CuO particles is essentially completely reduced to either Cu2O or metallic copper, as evidenced by loss of the characteristic Cu(2+) XPS features of dried powder samples. Companion ultrahigh-vacuum studies have been performed by dosing clean, oxygen-dosed, and ozone-treated single crystal Cu(111) with methanethiol (MT) gas at room temperature. In the latter case, the surface corresponds to CuO/Cu(111). XPS confirms MT adsorption in all cases, with an S 2p peak binding energy of 162.9 \u00b1 0.1 eV, consistent with methanethiolate adsorption. Heating of MT-covered Cu(111) and oxygen-dosed Cu(111) leads to decomposition/desorption of the MT by 100 \u00b0C and formation of copper sulfide with an S 2p binding energy of 161.8 eV. Dosing CuO/Cu(111) with 50-200 L of MT leads to only partial reduction/removal of the CuO surface layers prior to methanethiolate adsorption. This is confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), which measures the occupied states near the Fermi level. For both the colloidal CuO and single crystal CuO/Cu(111) studies, the reduction of the Cu(2+) surface is believed to occur by formation and desorption of the corresponding dithiol prior to thiolate adsorption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The University of Massachusetts Lowell , Lowell, Massachusetts 01854, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yiwen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The University of Massachusetts Lowell , Lowell, Massachusetts 01854, United States."}], "LastName": "Im", "ForeName": "Jisun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Natick, Massachusetts 01760, United States."}], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Jason W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Natick, Massachusetts 01760, United States."}], "LastName": "Steeves", "ForeName": "Diane M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The University of Massachusetts Lowell , Lowell, Massachusetts 01854, United States."}], "LastName": "Whitten", "ForeName": "James E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27036074", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00651"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
