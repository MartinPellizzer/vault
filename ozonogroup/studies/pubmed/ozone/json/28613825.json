However, for most of the reported works, an annealing temperature of 180 \u00b0C is generally required. This temperature is reluctantly considered to be a low temperature, especially with respect to the flexible application where 180 \u00b0C is still too high for the polyethylene terephthalate flexible substrate to bear. In this contribution, low temperature (about 70 \u00b0C) UV/ozone treatment was applied to in situ synthesis of SnO<sub>2</sub> films deposited on the fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate as ETL. This method is a facile photochemical treatment which is simple to operate and can easily eliminate the organic components. Accordingly, PH PSCs with UV-sintered SnO<sub>2</sub> films as ETL were successfully fabricated for the first time. The device exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance as high as 16.21%, which is even higher than the value (11.49%) reported for a counterpart device with solution-processed and high temperature annealed SnO<sub>2</sub> films as ETL. These low temperature solution-processed and UV-sintered SnO<sub>2</sub> films are suitable for the low-cost, large yield solution process on a flexible substrate for optoelectronic devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Like", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiaoxiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microelectronic Science and Engineering, Ningbo University , Zhejiang 315211, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Yangyang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Hongkun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microelectronic Science and Engineering, Ningbo University , Zhejiang 315211, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Ziyang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2115-5661"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, The Tianjin Key Laboratory for Optical-Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jianjun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28613825", "10.1021/acsami.7b04392"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
