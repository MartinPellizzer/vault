The results attained show a higher efficiency for ozonation using a lower catalyst load. Nevertheless, Fenton's process led to a larger amount of chemical oxidation demand (COD) removed per mole of oxidant applied. It was concluded that hydroxyl radicals are responsible for the pollutant abatement. High eco-toxicity decay was observed after the treatments. Furthermore, a preliminary analysis of the iron shavings' stability was made by reusing it in two feed-batch trials. It was concluded that while activity was maintained for Fenton's, a decrease of about 20% was verified for catalytic ozonation. Comparing these results with the ones obtained for the same processes applied to an actual OMW, a lower percentage of COD abatement was achieved. However, when reporting the amount of COD removed per mole of oxidant used, the difference between effluents are not so high. This should be taken into account when deciding which process should be implemented at an industrial scale. With the outcomes of this research it was possible to conclude that integrating waste management with wastewater treatment was feasible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Processes and Forest Products Research Center (CIEPQPF), GERST - Group on Environment, Reaction, Separation and Thermodynamics, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra 3030-790, Portugal E-mail: martins@eq.uc.pt."}], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Rui C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Processes and Forest Products Research Center (CIEPQPF), GERST - Group on Environment, Reaction, Separation and Thermodynamics, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra 3030-790, Portugal E-mail: martins@eq.uc.pt."}], "LastName": "Ramos", "ForeName": "Carina M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Processes and Forest Products Research Center (CIEPQPF), GERST - Group on Environment, Reaction, Separation and Thermodynamics, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra 3030-790, Portugal E-mail: martins@eq.uc.pt."}], "LastName": "Henriques", "ForeName": "Lucy R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Processes and Forest Products Research Center (CIEPQPF), GERST - Group on Environment, Reaction, Separation and Thermodynamics, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra 3030-790, Portugal E-mail: martins@eq.uc.pt."}], "LastName": "Quinta-Ferreira", "ForeName": "Rosa M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Olea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26942537", "10.2166/wst.2015.454"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
