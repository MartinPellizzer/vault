Recent advances in electrochemistry (i.e. proton-exchange membrane and electrolysis technologies) have made available a novel and continuous source of O3 gas up to 20% by weight. It is possible that the rapid delivery of high concentrations of O3 will result in mycotoxin degradation in contaminated grains--with minimal destruction of nutrients. The major objectives of this study were to investigate the degradation and detoxification of common mycotoxins in the presence of high concentrations of O3. In this study, aqueous equimolar (32 microM) solutions of aflatoxins B1 (AfB1), B2 (AfB2), G1 (AfG1), G2 (AfG2), cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), fumonisin B1 (FB1), ochratoxin A (OA), patulin, secalonic acid D (SAD) and zearalenone (ZEN) were treated with 2, 10 and/or 20 weight% O3 over a period of 5.0 min and analysed by HPLC. Results indicated that AfB1 and AfG1 were rapidly degraded using 2% O3, while AfB2 and AfG2 were more resistant to oxidation and required higher levels of O3 (20%) for rapid degradation. In other studies, patulin, CPA, OA, SAD and ZEN were degraded at 15 sec, with no by-products detectable by HPLC. Additionally, the toxicity of these compounds (measured by a mycotoxin-sensitive bioassay) was significantly decreased following treatment with O3 for 15 sec. In another study, FB1 (following reaction with O3) was rapidly degraded at 15 sec, with the formation of new products. One of these appeared to be a 3-keto derivative of FB1. Importantly, degradation of FB1 did not correlate with detoxification, since FB1 solutions treated with O3 were still positive in two bioassay systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Public Health, Faculty of Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843-4458, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKenzie", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarr", "ForeName": "A B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mayura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bailey", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rogers", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Norred", "ForeName": "W P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Voss", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plattner", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubena", "ForeName": "L F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P42-ESO4917", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydra"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inactivation, Metabolic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9350226", "10.1016/s0278-6915(97)00052-5", "S0278691597000525"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
