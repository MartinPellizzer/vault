The effects of pH, transition metal ions, and granular activated carbon (GAC) were investigated. Removal of DEHP increased with increase in pH and among metal ions Cr(III) was found to be the most active catalyst to remove DEHP. In the case of GAC, original carbon (G0) and GAC pre-ozonated in gas phase for 10 min (G10) were tested as catalysts in catalytic ozonation and found G0 to be more active than G10. This is because, during pre-ozonation, basic groups like chromene, pyrones and also graphene layers were oxidized to acidic surface oxygen groups. These basic surface groups are reported to be active catalytic centres for ozone decomposition into .OH which is a strong oxidant. According to kinetic manipulations, DEHP degradation rate constant due to .OH was affected by the catalyst while that due to direct ozonation is same in all cases with or without catalyst. G0 was doped with chromia gels (G0/CrA) to combine the benefits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. G0/CrA showed lower catalytic efficiency than that of only G0. This might be because of changes in surface structure of GAC caused by doping of chromia gel and changes in chemical nature of Cr(III) during formation of gel. A good correlation was found between the rate constants of ozone decay and DEHP degradation (R2=0.96). This correlation confirms that ozone decomposition into .OH is a critical factor for the activity of a catalyst during ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Technology Research, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, 39-1 Hawolgok-Dong, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul 136-791, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hammad Khan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jin Young", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C42K0PH13C", "NameOfSubstance": "Diethylhexyl Phthalate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diethylhexyl Phthalate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18405939", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.02.037", "S0045-6535(08)00220-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
