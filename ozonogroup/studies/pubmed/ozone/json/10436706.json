Daily concentrations of contaminants in Santiago and meteorological variables, were obtained from SESMA the Metropolitan Environmental Health Services. An association between contamination and mortality due to respiratory or cardiovascular diseases in subjects over 65 years old was searched, using temporal series analysis.", "There was a significant association between air pollution, meteorological variables on the same and previous days and mortality. PM10 had the strongest association with mortality. The relative risk of a 100 micrograms/m3 increment in PM10 was 1.052 for the elderly, 1.025 for cardiovascular and 1.061 for respiratory mortality. The relative risk of SO2 was 1.006 for all deaths and 1.017 for respiratory deaths.
