Airway responsiveness was measured by PC(200)Mch, the concentration required to produce a doubling in the baseline specific airway resistance to an inhaled methacholine aerosol, in spontaneously breathing animals. Before exposure to 3 ppm O(3) for 30 min, animals inhaled either SOD (5000 U/ml) or vehicle for 5 min. Although SOD did not affect PC(200)Mch in the air control group, this agent reduced the O(3)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Repeated administration of apocynin (12 mg/kg for 4 days) also attenuated the O(3)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. These data suggest that superoxide may be involved in the pathogenesis of O(3)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, possibly through the stimulation of superoxide anions release from bronchoalveolar phagocytes. The data also suggest a potential therapeutic role for antioxidants in oxidant injury by air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Department of Internal Medicine, Yokohama City University, School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kudo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishikawa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikeda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okubo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9612020", "ISSNLinking": "1382-6689"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21781697", "10.1016/1382-6689(96)00024-5", "1382-6689(96)00024-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
