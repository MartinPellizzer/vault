The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of climatological factors and air pollution levels on PE in Spain from 2001 to 2013.", "We carried out a retrospective study. Data were collected from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) and the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) of Spain. A case-crossover analysis was applied to identify environmental risk factors related to hospitalizations and deaths. For each patient, climatic and pollutant factors were assigned using data from the meteorological station closest to his/her postal code.", "A seasonal effect for PE hospital admission was observed, with more frequent admissions noted during Spain's colder seasons with peaks in autumn and winter. Lower temperatures as well as higher concentrations of NO2 and O3 at the time of admission (when 2weeks and 3weeks respectively were used as controls) were significant risk factors for hospital admissions with PE.", "Pulmonary embolism epidemiology was adversely influenced by colder climatological factors (absolute temperature, and seasonality) and higher concentrations of ambient air pollution (NO2, O3)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 European Federation of Internal Medicine.
