Second-order rate constants (k) for the reactions of the eight UV filters with ozone and OH were determined by quantum chemical calculations and competition kinetics methods, respectively. The UV filters containing phenolic (ethylhexyl-salicylate, homosalate, and benzophenone-3) and olefinic moieties (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, benzyl-cinnamate, and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate) showed high ozone reactivity (k\u202f\u2265\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>4</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>\u202fat pH 7), while those without such electron-rich moieties (isoamyl-benzoate and benzophenone) were ozone-refractory. All the UV filters showed high OH reactivity (k\u202f\u2265\u202f6.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>9</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). In concordance with the rate constant information, the phenolic and olefinic UV filters were efficiently eliminated by ozone treatment, requiring specific ozone doses of <0.5 mgO<sub>3</sub>/mgDOC for \u223c100% elimination. The UV filters were eliminated by\u202f\u2264\u202f38% at a UV fluence of 1500\u202fmJ/cm<sup>2</sup> in the UV<sub>254nm</sub>-only treatment. Rapid photoisomerisation between the E and Z geometric isomers was observed for the olefinic UV filter, benzyl-cinnamate. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10\u202fmg/L) greatly enhanced the elimination of all UV filters, indicating that OH was the main contributor to their elimination in the UV<sub>254nm</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. A chemical kinetics approach developed previously for ozonation and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processes was shown to predict the elimination of the UV filters in the tested water matrices reasonably well, demonstrating that the chemical kinetics method can be used for a priori prediction of micropollutant elimination in oxidative treatment processes for potable reuse of municipal wastewater effluents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
