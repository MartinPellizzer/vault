O(<sup>1</sup>D) atoms were produced by the pulsed laser photolysis of ozone at 266 nm. Two different types of experiments, kinetics measurements and H-atom product yield determinations, were performed by detecting O(<sup>1</sup>D) atoms and H(<sup>2</sup>S) atoms, respectively, by vacuum ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence. The measured rate constants are in agreement with previous work at room temperature, and little or no temperature dependence was observed as the temperature was decreased to 50 K. H-atom yields were found to be independent of temperature for the reaction of O(<sup>1</sup>D) with ethane. These product yields are discussed in the context of earlier dynamics measurements at higher temperature. Due to the influence of secondary reactions, no H-atom yields could be obtained for the reaction of O(<sup>1</sup>D) with acetylene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux , Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires , F-33400 Talence , France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNRS , Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires , F-33400 Talence , France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nu\u00f1ez-Reyes", "ForeName": "Dianailys", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux , Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires , F-33400 Talence , France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNRS , Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires , F-33400 Talence , France."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8317-2606"], "LastName": "Hickson", "ForeName": "Kevin M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29715024", "10.1021/acs.jpca.8b02267"]}}]}
