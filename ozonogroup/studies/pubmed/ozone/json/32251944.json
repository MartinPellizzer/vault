Previous studies indicated that contaminants can be sorted into five groups based on their reaction rate constants with ozone and hydroxyl radical to predict degradation of chemical contaminants during ozonation of municipal effluents. Spiking representatives of each group into five RO concentrate samples, this study demonstrated that the same contaminant grouping scheme could be used to predict contaminant degradation during ozonation of RO concentrates, despite the higher concentrations of ozone and hydroxyl radical scavengers. The predictive capability of the contaminant grouping scheme was further validated for four contaminants of concern in RO concentrates, including the pesticides fipronil and imidacloprid, and the metal chelates Ni-EDTA and Cu-EDTA. After measuring their ozone and hydroxyl radical reaction rate constants, these compounds were assigned to contaminant groups, and their degradation during ozonation matched predictions. Addition of 300\u00a0mg/L CaO at pH 11 achieved partial removal of the native nickel and copper by precipitation. Ozone pretreatment further enhanced precipitation of nickel, but not copper. Ozonation achieved 5-log inactivation of MS2 in all five concentrate samples at 1.18\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC. Ozonation at 0.9\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC formed 139-451\u00a0\u03bcg/L bromate. Pretreatment of RO concentrates with chlorine and ammonia reduced bromate formation by a maximum of 48% but increased total halogenated DBP concentrations from 20\u00a0\u03bcg/L to 36\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Regardless, neither bromate nor trihalomethane concentrations exceeded threshold concentrations of concern for discharge to marine waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
