On the other hand chloro-fluoro-carbon (CFC) was used with pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid therapy, but CFC became banning the use because of ozone depleting substance. Hydrofluorocarbon (HFA134a, tetra-fluoro-methane) is used as alternative CFC until now. Less-famously hydro-fluoro-carbon (HFA134a) have 1300-fold (mole ratio) energy of heat-trapping relative to carbon dioxide. On an extremely localized story, we derived substantial gravity of carbon dioxide from sales total of pressured metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) steroid drugs for the year in Japan. The amount of total sales of inhaled corticosteroid drugs on annual 2006 year was 320 hundred-millions yen. 88 hundred-millions yen (27.4% for total ICS sales) was accounted for pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid. Now in Japan there are three kinds of pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid drugs which all use tetra-fluoro-methane (HFA134a). In fact total gravity of tetra-fluoro-methane (HFA134a) from pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid for annual 2006 year was 19.7\u202ft and substantial gravity of carbon dioxide was 10.8 thousand ton. As total gravity of carbon dioxide production throughout the year in Japan was 13 hundred-million ton. Therefore substantial gravity of carbon dioxide by steroids pressured metered-dose inhaler was very small (0.001%) compared to total carbon dioxide production in Japan. Until today carbon-dioxide reducing make very slow progress, for that reason medical service worker unexceptionally should exert an effort for carbon-dioxide reduction if only slightly through the daily clinical examination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MURAYAMA Pediatrics, 3-2-33 Nagayoshi-Nagahara-Higashi, Hirano-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka 547-0013, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murayama", "ForeName": "Norihide", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MURAYAMA Pediatrics, 3-2-33 Nagayoshi-Nagahara-Higashi, Hirano-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka 547-0013, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murayama", "ForeName": "Kikuno", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30258963", "PMC6153269", "10.1016/j.dib.2018.08.070", "S2352-3409(18)30922-3"]}}]}
