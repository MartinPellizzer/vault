The plates were exposed to room air or to different concentrations of ozone for up to four hours, as were uninoculated plates. All plates were then incubated at 25 degrees C until quantitative colony counts could be performed.", "The effect of ozone on fungal conidia viability was assessed by comparing quantitative colony counts from conidia exposed to ozone to quantitative colony counts from conidia exposed only to room air.", "There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in viable conidia of all three fungi, at ozone concentrations of 5.0-12.8 parts per million, by four hours of exposure.
