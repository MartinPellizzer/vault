Death data were obtained from daily medical records of 7230 incidents from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the Longquanyi District of China from 2016 to 2017. Air pollution data were obtained from environmental monitoring stations in the Longquanyi District. Time series analysis using generalized additive Poisson regression models was applied, and single-pollutant and two-pollutant adjusted models were utilized. Furthermore, categories based on gender, age, and meteorological factors were considered in the analysis. The results indicated that PM2.5, PM10, O<sub>3</sub> , and CO had significant effects on dynamic stroke mortality, which were stronger for older people and during the cold season. This study helps hospital managers, patients, and governments seeking to prevent and control the effects of air pollution on the risks of stroke."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6678-3760"], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Yuting", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6261-2171"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fengyi", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First People's Hospital of Longquanyi District, Chengdu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First People's Hospital of Longquanyi District, Chengdu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qing", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "No.71532007, No.71131006, No.71172197", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "No.71172197", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "No.71131006", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "No.71532007", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "No. skqy201411, No.2018skzx-pt173, No. skzx2017-sb", "Agency": "Sichuan University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "No. skzx2017-sb222", "Agency": "Sichuan University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "No.2018skzx-pt173", "Agency": "Sichuan University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "No. skqy201411", "Agency": "Sichuan University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Health Plann Manage", "NlmUniqueID": "8605825", "ISSNLinking": "0749-6753"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poisson Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Katan M, Luft A.
