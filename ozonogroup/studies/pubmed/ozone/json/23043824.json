Cantaloupes inoculated with a rifampin-resistant strain of Salmonella Poona (10(7) CFU/ml) for 3 min and dried for 12 h were washed with chlorine (200 mg free chlorine per liter, 3 min), lactic acid (2%, 2 min), or ozone (30 mg/liter, 5 min). Fresh-cut cantaloupe cubes were prepared by (i) cutting the cantaloupe and then removing the rind or by (ii) peeling the rind and then cutting the flesh into pieces. The numbers of Salmonella bacteria recovered were higher in the stem scar portion (6.3 \u00b1 0.3 log CFU/cm(2)) than the surface (4.8 \u00b1 0.2 log CFU/cm(2)). Surface treatment with tap water or chlorine did not reduce Salmonella numbers, while treatment with lactic acid or ozone reduced Salmonella by 2.5 or 2.3 log CFU/cm(2), respectively. The use of lactic acid to sanitize the cantaloupes resulted in less Salmonella transfer to flesh during cutting; Salmonella numbers decreased to below detectable levels over 9 days of refrigerated (4\u00b0C) storage. Cutting cantaloupes after peeling the rind was more effective at reducing transfer of Salmonella to the internal tissue than cutting of cantaloupes prior to rind removal. These data suggest that treatment of cantaloupe rinds with lactic acid or ozone may be effective at reducing Salmonella numbers, while lactic acid application resulted in reduction of Salmonella transfer to cantaloupe flesh."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-2471, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vadlamudi", "ForeName": "Sasi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "T Matthew", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blankenburg", "ForeName": "Charles", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castillo", "ForeName": "Alejandro", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis melo"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refrigeration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella enterica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23043824", "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-159", "S0362-028X(23)03998-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
