The pollutants or potential pollutants likely to be found in urban air are noted, and the procedures for setting air-quality standards are outlined by way of two examples, ozone and lead. The provisional character of air-quality standard is emphasized. Special attention is given to photochemical smog as being a form of air pollution endemic to urbanized countries with warm climates like that of Australia. The characteristics of photochemical smog are discussed, and figures are presented to illustrate its prevalence in several Australian cities over the past few years. Finally, reference is made to research on the role of hydrocarbon emissions in the formation of smog conducted by the writer and his colleagues in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulcahy", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Med J Aust", "NlmUniqueID": "0400714", "ISSNLinking": "0025-729X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7278753", "10.5694/j.1326-5377.1981.tb135962.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
