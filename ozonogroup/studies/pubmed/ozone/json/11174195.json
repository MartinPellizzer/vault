RANTES was detected only in HBECs derived from asthmatic subjects. Exposure of HBECs of asthmatic subjects to both 50 to 100 ppb O3 and 200 to 400 ppb NO2 significantly increased the release of IL-8, GM-CSF, RANTES, and sICAM-1 from these cells after 24 hours of incubation. However, 50 to 100 ppb O3 and 200 to 400 ppb NO2 led to a significant increase in release of only IL-8 and sICAM-1 from HBECs of nonasthmatic subjects after 24 hours' incubation. A comparison between the pollutant-induced release of mediators demonstrated that 100 ppb O3-induced release of GM-CSF and sICAM-1 was significantly greater in HBECs of asthmatic subjects (medians, 0.59 and 27.4 pg/microg cellular protein, respectively) than in HBECs of nonasthmatic subjects (medians, 0.27 and 14.4 pg/microg cellular protein, respectively; P < .02).", "These results suggest that O3 and NO2 may modulate airway diseases, such as asthma, by increasing the release of inflammatory mediators from bronchial epithelial cells and that the cells of asthmatic subjects may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of these pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Dicle, Diyarbakir, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bayram", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sapsford", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdelaziz", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khair", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokine CCL5"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83869-56-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chemokine CCL5"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Immediate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Secretory Rate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11174195", "10.1067/mai.2001.111141", "S0091-6749(01)19408-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
