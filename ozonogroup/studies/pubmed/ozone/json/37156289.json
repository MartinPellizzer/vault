In this study, a process was developed to remove an odorous VOC using a combined non-thermal plasma (NTP) and wet scrubber (WS) system. The low removal efficiency of WSs and the large amount of ozone generated by NTP were resolved. Compared to the decomposition effects when using a WS and NTP separately, the NTP\u00a0+\u00a0WS system improved the removal efficiency of ethyl acrylate (EA) and significantly reduced ozone emissions. The maximum EA removal efficiency was 99.9%. Additionally, an EA removal efficiency of over 53.4% and a 100% ozone removal efficiency were achieved even at discharge voltages lower than 4.5\u00a0kV. Ozone catalysis was confirmed to occur in the NTP\u00a0+\u00a0WS system. Furthermore, we verified the removal of by-products such as residual ozone and formaldehyde, which is a representative organic intermediate of EA. This study demonstrates that the NTP\u00a0+\u00a0WS system is a green technology for removing odorous VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
