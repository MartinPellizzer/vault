NO<sub>x</sub> observations are compared in two environments: source testing from the combustion of Southwestern biomass fuels, and urban, ambient NO<sub>x</sub>. The latter occurred in the urban core of Albuquerque, NM, at an EPA NCORE site during February-March 2017, a relatively clean photochemical environment with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) <60 ppb for all but 6\u00a0hr. We compare two techniques used to measure NO<sub>x</sub> in biomass smoke during biomass burning source testing: light absorption at 405\u00a0nm and a traditional chemiluminescence monitor. Two additional oxides of nitrogen techniques were added in urban measurements: a cavity attenuated phase shift instrument for direct NO<sub>2</sub>, and the NO<sub>y</sub> chemiluminescence instrument (conversion of NO<sub>y</sub> to NO by molybdenum catalyst). We find agreement similar to laboratory standards for NO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and NO comparing all four instruments (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.97, slopes between 0.95 and 1.01, intercepts < 2 ppb for 1-hr averages) in the slowly varying ambient setting. Little evidence for significant interferences in NO<sub>2</sub> measurements was observed in comparing techniques in late-winter urban Albuquerque. This was also confirmed by negligible NO<sub>z</sub> contributions as measured with an NO<sub>y</sub> instrument. For the rapidly varying (1-min) higher NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations in biomass smoke source testing, larger variability characterized chemiluminescence and absorption instruments. Differences between the two instruments were both positive and negative and occurred for total NO<sub>x</sub>, NO, and NO<sub>2</sub>. Nonetheless, integrating the NO<sub>x</sub> signals over an entire burn experiment and comparing 95 combustion experiments, showed little evidence for large systematic influences of possible interfering species biasing the methods. For concentrations of <2 ppm, a comparison of burn integrated NOx, NO<sub>2</sub>, and NO yielded slopes of 0.94 to 0.96, R<sup>2</sup> of 0.83 to 0.93, and intercepts of 8 to 25 ppb. We attribute the latter, at least in part, to significant noise particularly at low NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations, resulting from short averaging times during highly dynamic lab burns. Discrepancies between instruments as indicated by the intercepts urge caution with oxides of nitrogen measurements at concentrations <50 ppb for rapidly changing conditions. Implications: Multiple NO<sub>x</sub> measurement methods were employed to measure NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations at an EPA NCORE site in Albuquerque, NM, and in smoke produced by the combustion of Southwestern biomass fuels. Agreement shown during intercomparison of these NO<sub>x</sub> techniques indicated little evidence of significant interfering species biasing the methods in these two environments. Instrument agreement is important to understand for accurately characterizing ambient NO<sub>x</sub> conditions in a range of environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering , New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology , Socorro , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Caroline", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering , New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology , Socorro , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carrico", "ForeName": "Christian M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering , New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology , Socorro , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomez", "ForeName": "Samantha L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b 2B Technologies , Boulder , CO, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "Peter C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b 2B Technologies , Boulder , CO, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turnipseed", "ForeName": "Andrew A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b 2B Technologies , Boulder , CO, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williford", "ForeName": "Craig J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b 2B Technologies , Boulder , CO, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Birks", "ForeName": "John W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c City of Albuquerque , Albuquerque , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salisbury", "ForeName": "Dwayne", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c City of Albuquerque , Albuquerque , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carrion", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c City of Albuquerque , Albuquerque , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gates", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Macias", "ForeName": "Fabian", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahn", "ForeName": "Thom", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aiken", "ForeName": "Allison C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "Manvendra K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29889623", "10.1080/10962247.2018.1487347"]}}]}
