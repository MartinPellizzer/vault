However, the role of the metal elements (M<sup>2+</sup> and M<sup>3+</sup>) in LDH catalysts is not clear. Here, LDH materials containing different metals (NiFe, NiAl, NiMn, CoFe, and MgFe) were prepared by a simple co-precipitation method. It was found that the LDHs containing Ni<sup>2+</sup> exhibited catalytic performance far superior to that of Co<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> for ozone elimination, and NiFe-LDH had the best activity and stability among LDH materials prepared in this study. The NiFe-LDH can maintain 78% catalytic activity within 144 h at room temperature, even under a relative humidity of 65% and a space velocity of 840 L\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>. Physicochemical characterizations demonstrated that chemical stability in an oxidizing atmosphere and the synergic role of M<sup>2+</sup> and M<sup>3+</sup> ions are crucial. The result of density functional theory calculation showed that the synergic role of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> weakens the interaction between O and H in the O-H bond, which effectively lowers the reaction barrier of ozone decomposition compared with MgFe-LDH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhisheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yingfa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3097-2658"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaotong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1770-3522"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Guangzhi", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-0669"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jinzhu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8476-8217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34969240", "10.1021/acs.est.1c07829"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
