A total of 37 977 sperm donation data from 2 971 healthy volunteers were analyzed. The average annual O<sub>3</sub> concentration (0.01\u00b0\u00d7 0.01\u00b0) was matched according to household address. A multivariate mixed-effect model was used to analyze the exposure-response relationship between the average O<sub>3</sub> exposure concentration and sperm quality in the previous year, with each donor as a random intercept. All results were presented as % changes with 95% confidence intervals (<i>CIs</i>) for all sperm parameters associated with 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increases in O<sub>3</sub>. The effects of individual characteristics on the association between O<sub>3</sub> and sperm quality were evaluated by stratified analysis. <b>Results:</b> The average O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the year before semen collection was (107.09\u00b17.50) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Each 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O<sub>3</sub> was associated with declined sperm concentration (-3.12%, 95%<i>CI</i>:-4.55%, -1.67%), total sperm count (-5.21%, 95%<i>CI</i>:-7.28%, -3.09%), total sperm motility (-1.49%, 95%<i>CI</i>:-2.37%, -0.61%), progressive motility (-2.53%, 95%<i>CI</i>:-3.78%, -1.26%), total motile sperm count (-5.82%, 95%<i>CI</i>:-8.17%, -3.41%), and progressively motile sperm count (-6.22%, 95%<i>CI</i>:-8.73%, -3.64%). Men aged 30 and above, obese, and with lower education levels might be more susceptible to the influence of O<sub>3</sub> on sperm quality, but the difference was not statistically significant (<i>P></i>0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> in Shandong Province is associated with a decrease in sperm quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Y N", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Women, Children and Reproductive Health, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "W K", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Women, Children and Reproductive Health, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "X H", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Women, Children and Reproductive Health, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ZR2021QH318", "Agency": "Shandong Natural Science Foundation", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2022YFC2703200", "Agency": "National Key Research and Development Program of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7904962", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Semen Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "19"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38715497", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20230818-00105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
