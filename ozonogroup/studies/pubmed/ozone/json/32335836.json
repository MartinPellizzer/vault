The technology proposed new avenues for the purification and utilization of remove SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> in flue gas. The effects of reaction temperature, solid-liquid ratio, and oxygen content on the efficiency of desulfurization and denitrification were studied experimentally. Results show that the parameters were solid-liquid ratio of 5.0\u00a0g/40\u00a0mL, T\u2009=\u200960\u00a0\u00b0C, \u03c6 (O<sub>2</sub>)\u2009=\u200920%, Q\u2009=\u2009300\u00a0mL/min under the best experimental conditions. The maximum amount of ozone generated was 563.8\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup>. The reaction time with desulfurization rate\u2009\u2265\u200999% was 340\u00a0min; the reaction time with denitrification rate\u2009\u2265\u200999% was 160\u00a0min. Response surface analysis method was used to perform a three-factor three-level response surface experiment. Results show that the oxygen content had a highly significant effect on the desulfurization and denitrification efficiency, and the relationship between the desulfurization and denitrification efficiency was oxygen content > mud-phosphorus slurry liquid-solid ratio\u2009>\u2009reaction temperature. The process is simple, the solid waste is used to treat the flue gas, and the removal effect is good, which is convenient for popularization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Lijuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zizhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jiyun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chenhui", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Tiancheng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, China. ningping86@163.com."}], "LastName": "Ning", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan, People's Republic of China. 451077062@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "51968075", "Agency": "the National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "51568067", "Agency": "the National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018FD054", "Agency": "the applied basic research surface project of Yunnan Province", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018FD053", "Agency": "the applied basic research surface project of Yunnan Province", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32335836", "10.1007/s11356-020-08852-8", "10.1007/s11356-020-08852-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
