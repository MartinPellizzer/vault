Personal intake fraction of NO<sub>2</sub> (P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>) and its spatial mean value in entire street (i.e. street intake fraction <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>>) are calculated to quantify pollutant exposure in near-road buildings. Chemical reaction contribution of NO<sub>2</sub> exposure (CRC<sub><P_IF></sub>), O<sub>3</sub> depletion rate (d<sub>ozone</sub>) and photostationary state defect (\u03b4<sub>ps</sub>) are used to analyze the interplay of turbulent and chemical processes. As H/W increases from 1, 3 to 5 with [O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>b</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0ppb, the flow pattern turns from single-main-vortex structure to two-counter-rotating-vortex structure, and pedestrian-level velocity becomes 1-2 orders smaller. The high-d<sub>ozone</sub> regions and low-|\u03b4<sub>ps</sub>| regions get larger with more complete chemical reactions. Consequently, passive <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>>\u00a0rises 1 order (4.09-5.71\u00a0ppm to 41.76\u00a0ppm), but reactive <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>> only increases several times (17.80-21.28\u00a0ppm to 58.50\u00a0ppm) and the contribution of chemistry (CRC<sub><P_IF></sub>) decreases with higher H/W. Thus, chemistry raises <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0more effectively in shallow street canyons (H/W\u00a0=\u00a01-3). In deep street canyons (H/W\u00a0=\u00a05), elevated-building design and wind catchers destroy two-counter-rotating-vortex structure, improve street ventilation and reduce passive <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>> by 2 and 1 orders (41.76\u00a0ppm to 0.38-5.16\u00a0ppm), however they only reduce reactive <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>> by about 97.5% and 75% (58.50\u00a0ppm to 1.61-14.48\u00a0ppm). Such building techniques induce lower O<sub>3</sub> depletion rate but greater chemical contribution. Finally, raising [O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>b</sub> from 20 to 100\u00a0ppb causes greater O<sub>3</sub> depletion rate and chemical contribution and produces larger <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>>. For deep street canyons, the impact of higher [O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>b</sub> on <P_IF<sub>NO2</sub>> is weaker than that in shallow street canyons, while it becomes stronger when fixing elevated-building design and wind catchers. This study provides some innovative findings on reactive pollutant exposure in 2D street canyons and offers effective CFD methodologies to evaluate pollutant exposure with more complicated chemistry and urban configurations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
