We collected daily concentrations of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and daily hospitalizations for bronchiectasis for 21 cities across Guangdong Province from 2013 through 2017. We examined their association using two-stage time-series analysis. Our analysis was stratified by specific sub-diagnosis, sex and age group to assess potential effect modifications. Relative risks of hospitalization for bronchiectasis were 1.060 (95%CI 1.014-1.108) for PM<sub>10</sub> at lag0-6, 1.067 (95%CI 1.020-1.116) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> at lag0-6, 1.038 (95%CI 1.005-1.073) for PM<sub>coarse</sub> at lag0-6, 1.058 (95%CI 1.015-1.103) for SO<sub>2</sub> at lag0-4, 1.057 (95%CI 1.030-1.084) for NO<sub>2</sub> at lag0 and 1.055 (95%CI 1.025-1.085) for CO at lag0-6 per interquartile range increase of air pollution. Specifically, acute fluctuations of air pollution might be a risk factor for bronchiectasis patients with lower respiratory infection but not with hemoptysis. Patients aged \u226565 years, and female patients appeared to be particularly susceptible to air pollution. Acute fluctuations of air pollution, particularly PM may increase the risk of hospital admission for bronchiectasis exacerbations, especially for the patients complicated with lower respiratory infection. This study strengthens the importance of reducing adverse impact on respiratory health of air pollution to protect vulnerable populations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH.
