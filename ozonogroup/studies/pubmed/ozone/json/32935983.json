Here, penguin colony soils (PCS) and the adjacent tundra soils (i.e., penguin-lacking colony soils, PLS), seal colony soils (SCS), tundra marsh soils (TMS), and normal upland tundra soils (UTS) in coastal Antarctica were collected and incubated for the first time to confirm that these soils were CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and CH<sub>3</sub>Br sources or sinks. Overall, tundra soil acted as a net sink for CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and CH<sub>3</sub>Br with potential flux ranges from -18.1 to -2.8 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> and -1.32 to -0.24 pmol g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The deposition of penguin guano or seal excrement into tundra soils facilitated the simultaneous production of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and CH<sub>3</sub>Br and resulted in a smaller sink in PCS, SCS, and PLS. Laboratory-based thermal treatments and anaerobic incubation experiments suggested that the consumption of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and CH<sub>3</sub>Br was predominantly mediated by microbes while the production was abiotic and O<sub>2</sub> independent. Temperature gradient incubations revealed that increasing soil temperature promoted the consumption of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and CH<sub>3</sub>Br in UTS, suggesting that the regional sink may increase with Antarctic warming, depending on changes in soil moisture and abiotic production rates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9874-9834"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Polar Environment and Global Change, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wanying", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5027-3144"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7757-3622"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Polar Environment and Global Change, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Renbin", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6358-2050"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Rhew", "ForeName": "Robert C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A6R43525YO", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tundra"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32935983", "10.1021/acs.est.0c04257"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
