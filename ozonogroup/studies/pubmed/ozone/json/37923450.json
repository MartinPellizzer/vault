To better understand the implications for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution control strategies, we applied integrated analysis approaches based on the de-weathered statistical model, parameterization methods, chemical box model, and positive matrix factorization model. During the MWG, concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and volatile organic compound (VOCs), OFP (O<sub>3</sub> formation potential), L<sub>OH</sub> (OH radical loss rate) were 83 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 43 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 26 ppbv, 188 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, and 3.9 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, which were 26%, 18%, 3%, 15%, and 13% lower than pre-MWG values and 6%, 39%, 30%, 33%, and 50% lower than post-MWG values, respectively. After removing meteorological influence, O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors during the MWG decreased largely compared with post-MWG values, and only O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) declined compared with pre-MWG values, which revealed the emission reduction measures during the MWG played an important role for O<sub>3</sub> decline. For six VOCs sources, the mass contributions of biomass burning and solvents usage during the MWG decreased largely compared with pre-MWG values. O<sub>3</sub> production was sensitive to VOCs and the key species were aromatics, OVOCs, and alkenes, which originated mainly from solvents usage, biomass burning, industrial-related combustion, and vehicle exhaust. Decreasing O<sub>3</sub> concentration during the strict control was mainly caused by OVOCs reduction due to biomass burning control. Generally, the O<sub>3</sub> abatement strategies of Wuhan should be focused on the mitigation of high-reactivity VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
