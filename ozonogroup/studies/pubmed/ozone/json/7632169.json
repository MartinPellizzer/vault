We hypothesized that lung injury from continuous 1-week O3 exposure would also be increased under conditions of AH2 deficiency because of (1) a diminished antioxidant pool to counteract the oxidant challenge, (2) impaired reparation of tissue injury, and/or (3) altered antioxidant redox homeostasis. Female Hartley guinea pigs (260-330 g) were made AH2 deficient by providing a diet similar to guinea pig chow, but having no AH2. The dietary regimen was started 1 week prior to exposure and was continued during exposure to O3 (0, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 ppm, 23 hr/day, 7 days) as well as 1 week post-exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and tissue AH2 were measured in subgroups at the beginning of exposure (1 week on the AH2-deficient diet), at its termination and 1 week post-exposure. AH2 measured in ear tissue punches proved to be an easy and effective monitor for AH2 deficiency. One week on the AH2-deficient diet caused a 70-80% drop in ear, lung and liver AH2, while AH2 in BAL was decreased by 90%. Immediately after the exposure, total BAL protein and albumin (markers of lung permeability) were increased (approximately 50%) at 0.8 ppm with no difference between the dietary groups. O3 caused an increase in total BAL cells and neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner with only a slight augmentation due to diet. Exposure to O3 caused an increase in lung and BAL AH2 in normal guinea pigs. Glutathione and uric acid were also increased in the lung and BAL after O3 exposure (40-570%) in both dietary groups, and the levels remained elevated during the recovery period. Lung alpha-tocopherol was not changed due to O3. A significant overall diet-related decrease was seen in AH2-deficient guinea pigs, immediately after the exposure and recovery. In summary, lung injury/inflammation following 1 week O3 exposure and recovery were minimally affected by AH2 deficiency. Antioxidants also appeared to increase in response to O3 exposure despite the deficiency in AH2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pulmonary Toxicology Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "U P", "Initials": "UP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dreher", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crissman", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hatch", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid Deficiency"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Homeostasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7632169", "10.1016/0006-2952(95)00122-g", "0006-2952(95)00122-G"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
