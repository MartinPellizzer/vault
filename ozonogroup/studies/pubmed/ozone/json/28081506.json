Three biofilters were operated in parallel to assess the effects of varying pre-treatment types and dosages. Conventionally treated water (coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation) was fed to one control biofilter, while the remaining two received water with varying applied doses of O<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. Changes in organic matter were characterized using parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC) and fluorescence peak shifts. Intensities of all PARAFAC components were reduced by pre-oxidation, however, individual humic-like components were observed to be impacted to varying degrees upon exposure to O<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. While the control biofilter uniformly reduced fluorescence of all PARAFAC components, three of the humic-like components were produced by biofiltration only when pre-oxidation was applied. A fluorescence red shift, which occurred with the application of O<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>, was attributed to a relative increase in carbonyl-containing components based on previously reported results. A subsequent blue shift in fluorescence caused by biofiltration which received pre-oxidized water indicated that biological treatment readily utilized organics produced by pre-oxidation. The results provide an understanding as to the impacts of organic matter character and pre-oxidation on biofiltration efficiency for organic matter removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
