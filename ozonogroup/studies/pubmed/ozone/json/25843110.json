To illustrate the capabilities of the approach, the kinetics of a well-studied reaction of surface-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with ozone are presented. Specifically, using helium as the reagent gas and with the DART heater temperature of 500 \u00b0C, nanogram quantities of benzo[e]pyrene (BeP) deposited on the outside of glass melting point capillary tubes were analyzed in positive ion mode with a limit of detection of 40 pg. Using bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate as an internal standard, the kinetics of the ozone-BeP reaction were assessed by determining the surface-bound BeP decays, after oxidation in an off-line reaction cell. The reaction is demonstrated to follow the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, known to prevail for heterogeneous reactions of this type. In addition, a wide array of oxygenated, condensed-phase products has been observed. The present work demonstrates the capability of the DART-MS technique to investigate the heterogeneous chemistry taking place on a wide range of surfaces, such as those that form in both outdoor and indoor environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shouming", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Forbes", "ForeName": "Matthew W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25843110", "10.1021/ac504722z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
