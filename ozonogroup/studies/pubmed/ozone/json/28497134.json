To meet our objective, anatase c-TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films with various OVD concentrations are prepared by changing the oxygen flux during the DC magnetron sputtering process and are characterized by the intensity of defect signals in the X-ray photoelectron spectra. We conclude that abundant OVDs can trigger an obviously increased majority carrier accumulation zone at the metal oxide/perovskite interface and enhanced capacitance, thereby greatly deteriorating photogenerated carrier collection efficiency. A detailed analysis of the study results also reveals that the presence of OVD in the bulk and surface of c-TiO<sub>2</sub> can slow down electronic carrier transport and lower its electron quasi-Fermi level under illumination, leading to the detrimental charge recombination in p-PSCs. Furthermore, we report a remarkably enhanced p-PSC efficiency via preparing c-TiO<sub>2</sub> using high oxygen flux and subsequent ultraviolet ozone treatment. As a consequence, repeatable power conversion efficiency (PCE) is propelled to as high as 16.62%, coupled with negligible hysteresis and increased stability. These results provide a significant implication for further perfecting efficient and stable p-PSCs for their record efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, Key Laboratory of Opto-electronic Information Science and Technology for Ministry of Education, Tianjin, 300071, China. caihongkun@nankai.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Yangyang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Hongkun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yunhao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Zhixue", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhenglong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Like", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jianjun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28497134", "10.1039/c7cp01936j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
