However, the influence mechanism of ubiquitous water vapor on catalytic ozonation of NH<sub>3</sub> is unclear. In this study, cryptomelane-type manganese oxide (OMS-2) catalyst was prepared and tested for catalytic ozonation of NH<sub>3</sub> in different relative humidity. The results showed that water vapor significantly decreased the catalytic activity, which was due to the inhibition of water on NH<sub>3</sub> adsorption on Lewis acid sites and O<sub>3</sub> decomposition on oxygen vacancies, as well as the combination of water with active oxygen species (O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> and O<sub>atom</sub>). And the effect of water vapor on NH<sub>3</sub> conversion was more significant than O<sub>3</sub> decomposition because more Mn-OH were involved in the O<sub>3</sub> decomposition under humid conditions. Combining in-situ DRIFTS results with the performance of NH<sub>3</sub> oxidation, it is found that L-2 acid sites (the peak of NH<sub>3</sub> adsorption on Lewis acid sites at 1188\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup>) were the main active sites for adsorption and activation of NH<sub>3</sub> in the early stage of catalytic reaction; as the reaction progressed, L-2 acid sites were gradually occupied by water and more Br\u00f8nsted acid sites participated in the catalytic reaction. This work deepened the understanding of the reaction process for selective catalytic ozonation of NH<sub>3</sub>, and provided theoretical guidance for the design of efficient hydrophobic catalysts to eliminate gaseous NH<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
