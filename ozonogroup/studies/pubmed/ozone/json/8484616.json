The present study examined whether female rats were more sensitive during lactation to the acute pulmonary injury produced by inhaled endotoxin. Lactating and age-matched virgin female rats were exposed to aerosols of saline or endotoxin for 3 h and lavaged at 24 h after exposure. No significant differences in lactate dehydrogenase, beta-glucuronidase, total protein, and total cell and PMN counts were observed between virgin and lactating rats after exposure to saline. Each marker of pulmonary injury except beta-glucuronidase was 1.5- to 3-fold greater in lactating than in virgin female rats exposed to 29.6 micrograms/m3 endotoxin. PMNs (6-fold), total cell counts, and protein were also significantly increased (p < 0.05) in lactating rats exposed to 1.3 micrograms/m3 endotoxin, a concentration reported to occur in a number of agricultural settings. These results demonstrate that the physiologic state of lactation is associated with an increased sensitivity to the acute pulmonary injury produced by inhaled endotoxin and are consistent with previous work demonstrating a similar increased sensitivity to ozone exposure. The possibility of a similar pattern of enhanced response in analogous groups of humans merits examination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, Tuxedo 10987."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weideman", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gunnison", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-02429", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-04947", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67924-63-4", "NameOfSubstance": "endotoxin, Escherichia coli"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8484616", "10.1164/ajrccm/147.5.1100"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
