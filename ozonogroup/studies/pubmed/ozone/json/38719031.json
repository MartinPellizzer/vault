However, empirical data on their occurrence in open ocean are scarce, which makes it difficult to estimate the significant contribution of open ocean releases to the global budget of halocarbons. This study was conducted in 2022 to explore the spatial variations of VSLBrHs and their controlling factors in the western tropical Pacific Ocean (WTPO). The findings highlighted that high biological productivity and the resulting dissolved organic matter (DOM) as well as upwelling dynamics significantly influenced the distribution and production of VSLBrHs in seawater, with atmospheric levels primarily governed by oceanic emissions. Based on the simultaneous observation of seawater and atmospheric concentrations, the mean sea-to-air fluxes of CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, CHBr<sub>3</sub>, CHBrCl<sub>2</sub>, and CHBr<sub>2</sub>Cl were estimated to be 1.01, 6.65, 9.31, and 7.25\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Sea-to-air fluxes of these gases in the upwelling regions were 9.0, 4.6, 2.9, and 6.8 times those in the non-upwelling regions, respectively. Additionally, in-situ incubation experiments revealed that the enzymatic mediated biosynthesis pathways of VSLBrHs were enhanced under temperature and light-induced stress and in waters rich in humus-like substances. Therefore, we tentatively concluded that abundant photothermal conditions and the existence of upwelling in the WTPO made it a potential hotspot for the emission of VSLBrHs. This study offers critical insights into the environmental dynamics of VSLBrHs emissions and underscores the importance of regional oceanic conditions in influencing atmospheric greenhouse gas compositions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
