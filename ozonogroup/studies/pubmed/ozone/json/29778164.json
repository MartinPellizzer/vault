In total, 196 and 145 chemicals were detected in secondary and final effluents, respectively. The majority of the total concentrations (average removal efficiency, 87.0%\u00b15.9%) of the micropollutants were removed during secondary treatments. However, advanced treatments achieved different micropollutant removal extents from secondary effluents depending on the different treatment processes employed. Highly variable removal efficiencies of total concentrations (32.7%-99.3%) were observed among the different advanced processes. Among them, ozonation-based processes could remove 70.0%-80.9% of the total concentrations of studied micropollutants. The potentially harmful micropollutants, based on their detection frequency and concentration in secondary and final effluents, were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (2-methylnaphthalene, fluoranthene, pyrene, naphthalene and phenanthrene), phosphorus flame retardants (tributyl phosphate (TBP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCP)), phthalates (bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)), benzothiazoles (benzothiazole, 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazol, and 2(3H)-benzothiazolone) and phenol. This study indicated that the presence of considerable amounts of micropollutants in secondary effluent creates the need for suitable advanced treatment before their reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
