In this study, the possibility of NDMA formation from chlorpheniramine ozonation was investigated. The influencing factors including the initial chlorpheniramine concentration, ozone dose, pH, and water matrix were quantified. Furthermore, the mechanisms for chlorpheniramine transformation and NDMA formation were explored. Our results demonstrate that ozonation is effective in removing chlorpheniramine. Generation of dimethylamine (DMA) and NDMA was observed during chlorpheniramine ozonation. Higher initial chlorpheniramine concentration and ozone dose resulted in higher production of NDMA. Acidic conditions (pH\u22645) did not facilitate the production of NDMA. Ozone molecules played a dominant role in chlorpheniramine degradation, and influenced DMA release and NDMA formation. DMA and NDMA generations as well as their degradations were mainly attributed to hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) produced by ozone decomposition. Water matrix properties such as HCO3(-) and humic acid affected DMA and NDMA generation due to \u00b7OH competition. The degradation intermediates of chlorpheniramine were identified, among which only the intermediates with a DMA group were attributable to NDMA formation. A possible pathway for NDMA formation from chlorpheniramine ozonation is proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
