Experimental results showed that E1, E2 and EE2 were oxidized in the range of 0.45-0.85 V and were removed through electro-polymerization. Observed data from continuous experiments were in good agreement with calculated results by a mathematical model constructed based on mass transfer limitation. In continuous treatment of trace estrogens (1 \u03bcg/L), 98% of E1, E2 and EE2 were stably removed. At high loading rate (100 \u03bcg/L), removal efficiency of E1 was kept around 74%-88% for 21 days, but removal efficiency reduced due to passivation of electrodes. However, removal efficiency was recovered after electrochemical regeneration of electrodes in presence of ozone. Electric energy consumption was observed in the range of 1-2 Wh/m(3). From these results, we concluded that the present electrochemical process would be an alternative removal of estrogens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
