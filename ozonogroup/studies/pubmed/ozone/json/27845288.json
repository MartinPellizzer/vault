Complicated changes in blood condition were also detected against the background of diabetes mellitus: chronometric hypocoagulation on the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation in association with chronometric hypercoagulation by the external thrombinogenesis mechanism and fibrinogenesis depression against the background of hypofibrinogenaemia. Thus, the use of ozone therapy in the presence of soft tissues abscesses in old rats with diabetes does not demonstrate significant protective properties with reduced azoalbumin lysis, total non-enzymatic fibrinolytic activity and proteinase activity by Kunitz in blood plasma. Such changes in old rats can be considered as an exacerbation of purulent inflammation, increase in toxicity, reduced protective properties, increase in manifestations of hypercoagulation against the background of chronic course of diabetes, caused by age-related changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine Bukovinian State Medical University, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Karatieieva", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine Bukovinian State Medical University, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Yurkiv", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine Bukovinian State Medical University, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Semenenko", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine Bukovinian State Medical University, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Kozlovskaya", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine Bukovinian State Medical University, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}], "LastName": "Yakobchuk", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Georgia (Republic)", "MedlineTA": "Georgian Med News", "NlmUniqueID": "101218222", "ISSNLinking": "1512-0112"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Suppuration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27845288"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
