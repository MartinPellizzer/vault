The data have been interpreted in terms of two dissociation mechanisms that give rise to fast and slow products. In both cases, excitation is believed to occur to the B state. Consistent with previous interpretations, the speed distributions, translational anisotropy parameters, and angular momentum polarization moments support the assignment of the major pathway to curve crossing from the B to the repulsive R surface, generating fast fragments in a wide range of vibrational states. For the slow fragments, it is proposed that following excitation to the B state, the system crosses onto the A state. The crossing seam is only accessible to molecules that are highly vibrationally excited and therefore possess modest recoil speeds. Once on the A state, the wavepacket is thought to funnel through a conical intersection to the ground state. The velocity distributions, spatial anisotropy parameters, spin-orbit populations and polarization data each lend support to this mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, The Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, U.K. mark.brouard@chem.ox.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brouard", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goman", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horrocks", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnsen", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quadrini", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuen", "ForeName": "W-H", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17935392", "10.1063/1.2790890"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
