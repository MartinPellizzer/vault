The OR was 1.037 (1.002; 1.074) in the high tertile of PM10 concentrations, and mean incidence was higher with PM10 levels in the highest, than in the medium/reference tertile. Mean age at T1D onset was linked with yearly PM10 and ozone air levels.", "On a wide period, a stable or decreased incidence of T1D was evident in children with early- or later onset of disease, respectively.
