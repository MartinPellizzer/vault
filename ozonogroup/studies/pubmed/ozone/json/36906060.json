In this study, we examined the regional transportation and potential influence of atmospheric aerosols triggered by HTHH volcano, based on active and passive satellite products, ground-based observations, multi-source reanalysis datasets and atmospheric radiative transfer model. The results indicated that about 0.7\u00a0Tg (1\u00a0Tg\u00a0=\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0kg) sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) gas were emitted into stratosphere from the HTHH volcano, and were lifted to an altitude of 30\u00a0km. The regional averaged SO<sub>2</sub> columnar content over the western Tonga increased by 10-36 Dobson Units (DU), and the mean aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieved from satellite products increased to 0.25-0.34. The stratospheric AOT values caused by HTHH emissions increased to 0.03, 0.20, and 0.23 on 16, 17, and 19 January, respectively, accounting for 1.5%, 21.9%, and 31.1% of total AOT. Ground-based observations also showed an AOT increase of 0.25-0.43, with the maximum daily average of 0.46-0.71 appeared on 17 January. The volcanic aerosols were remarkably dominated by fine-mode particles and posed strong light-scattering and hygroscopic abilities. Consequently, the mean downward surface net shortwave radiative flux was reduced by 2.45-11.9 Wm<sup>-2</sup> on different regional scales, and the surface temperature decreased by 0.16-0.42\u00a0K. The maximum aerosol extinction coefficient was 0.51\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup> appeared at 27\u00a0km, which resulted in an instantaneous shortwave heating rate of 1.80 Khour<sup>-1</sup>. These volcanic materials stayed stable in the stratosphere and completed one circle around the earth within 15 days. This would exert a profound influence on the energy budget, water vapor and ozone exchange in the stratosphere, which deserves to be further studied."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
