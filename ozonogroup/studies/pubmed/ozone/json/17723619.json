The hydrocarbon composition was determined by using GC/MS and GC/FID. The air samples were pre-concentrated onto glass beads prior to separation by PLOT and DB-1 columns of GC. The method showed detection limit of <1 ppb and relative standard deviation in the range of 5-30% for different compounds. Aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene, benzene, etc.) and aliphatic hydrocarbons (ethylene, acetylene, propane, etc.) were correlated primarily to determine the source of emission. The estimated hydrocarbons were ranked according to their abundance and photochemical reactivity. The criteria pollutants, ozone and NO2 were measured by UV-differential optical absorption spectroscopy (UV-DOAS), and were utilized to determine the relative importance of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and significant contribution of NO2 in limiting ozone formation. The obtained results suggest that ozone formation in Taipei city is probably limited by the supply of non-methane hydrocarbons. The concentration profile of targeted pollutants was compared to other metropolitan areas to determine air quality and the pollutant sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atomic Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ben-Zen", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Chih-Chung", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sree", "ForeName": "Usha", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Konghwa", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lo", "ForeName": "Jiunn-Guang", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0370534", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2670"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17723619", "10.1016/j.aca.2006.03.009", "S0003-2670(06)00504-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
