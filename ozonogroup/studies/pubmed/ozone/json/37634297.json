Ammonia gas lost to the environment causes soil acidification, eutrophication and contributes to global warming through increased greenhouse gas emissions and ozone layer depletion. The active chemical NBPT blocks the soil microbial enzyme (urease) and reduces ammonia emission. Furthermore, NBPT's use in agriculture might benefit farmers by reducing reliance on expensive nitrate fertiliser and aiding in a shift to more urea-based fertiliser (using NBPT co-applied with urea is more cost-effective). The present study was carried out to characterise the potential transfer of NBPT from grass to liquid milk and compute the associated human health risks. Using probabilistic risk assessment techniques, an exposure assessment model was developed to calculate the Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) of NBPT from milk, following co-application of NBPT with a urea N-fertiliser. Results show that the predicted mean concentration of NBPT in milk is 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-8</sup> mg NBPT/kg milk, while the mean daily intake (EDI) of NBPT is 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-11</sup> mg NBPT /kg BW/day). Back-calculations revealed that, under the studied conditions, for the EDI to exceed ADI of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup> mg NBPT/kg BW/ day, the NBPT application rate would need to exceed the NBPT fertiliser limit (0.09-0.2% by mass of urea nitrogen) set in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/2008, and the bio-transfer factor would need to be over 100% (implausible). Sensitivity analysis revealed soil pH (S<sub>PH</sub>), phytoaccumulation factor (P<sub>F</sub>), NBPT permissible levels in fertiliser (NBPT<sub>%</sub>), pasture cover (P), and grazing rotation length (t) as critical factors influencing the EDI of NBPT. The present study concludes that NBPT presents negligible risk to human health under the conditions and assumptions studied."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
