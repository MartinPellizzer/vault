This study investigates the evolution and factors of secondary inorganic aerosols based on two pollution incidences in Nanjing in June 2014. A significant characteristic of air pollution complex with the coexistence of higher concentrations of both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone is observed. In the earlier stage of the pollution episode, ozone concentrations were high, which could exceed 250, triggering a stronger oxidation in the atmosphere and a higher production potential of nitric acid that leads to the quick production of nitrate. In the later period of the pollution episode, relative humidity played an essential role. An increase in relative humidity would result in a sharp decrease in the theoretical product of the partial pressures of NH<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>, especially when relative humidity exceeds the mutual deliquesce relative humidity that makes it easier to form nitrate. The difference in the theoretical and observational partial pressure product could characterize the evolution of nitrate perfectly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Jian-Qi", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Bao-Zhu", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zi-Fa", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiang-Zhi", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Li-Li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Dan-Hui", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965236", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201702026"]}}]}
