In the case of Earth and other inner planets, early outgassing released mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour. The secondary veneer of comets and meteorites added further volatiles. Photodissociation caused secondary changes, including the production of traces of oxygen from water. Earth's gravity cannot retain light gases, including hydrogen. but retains oxygen. Water vapour generally does not pass the cold trap at the stratopause. In the archaean, early evolution of life, probably in hydrothermal vents, and the subsequent development of photosynthesis in surface waters, produced oxygen, at 3500 Ma or even earlier, becoming a significant component of the atmosphere from about 2000 Ma. Thereafter banded iron formations became rare, and iron was deposited in oxidized red beds. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen have varied during the Phanerozoic: major changes may have caused extinctions. particularly the Permian/Triassic. The declining greenhouse effect due to the long-term decrease in carbon dioxide has largely offset increasing solar luminosity, and changes in carbon dioxide levels relate strongly to cycles of glaciation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nunn", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Proc Geol Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "100971369", "ISSNLinking": "0016-7878"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Evolution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Earth, Planet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evolution, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evolution, Planetary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Origin of Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solar System"}], "NumberOfReferences": "67"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11543127", "10.1016/s0016-7878(98)80001-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
