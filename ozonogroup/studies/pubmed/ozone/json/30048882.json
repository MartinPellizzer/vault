We aimed to investigate the associations of long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants with lipid levels and dyslipidemias in China.", "In 2009, a total of 15,477 participants aged 18-74\u202fyears were recruited from the 33 Communities Chinese Health Study conducted in three Northeastern China cities. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured in participants' blood specimens. Three year (2006-08) average air pollution concentrations were assessed using data from 33 communities (particles with diameters \u22641.0\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>1</sub>) and \u22642.5\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) were predicted using a spatial statistical model) or 11 air monitoring stations (particles with diameters \u226410\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)). Associations were evaluated by two-level logistic and generalized linear regression models.", "We detected many significant associations between exposure to air pollutants (especially for PM<sub>1</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and blood lipid levels. Most of the associations suggested deleterious effects on blood lipid markers (e.g., a 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>1</sub> was associated with 1.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 2.0), 2.9% (95% CI: -3.3, 9.3), and 3.2% (95% CI: 2.6, 3.9) higher levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C, respectively, but 1.4% (95% CI: -1.8, -0.9) lower HDL-C levels), although beneficial associations were found for O<sub>3</sub>. In analysis with dyslipidemias, all the observed associations suggested deleterious lipidemic effects of air pollutants, and no significant beneficial association was observed for O<sub>3</sub>. Stratified analyses showed that the associations were stronger in overweight or obese participants; sex and age modified the associations, but the pattern of effects was mixed.", "Long-term ambient air pollution was associated with both altered lipid profiles and dyslipidemias, especially among overweight or obese participants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
