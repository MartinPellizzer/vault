In order to improve air quality, the Chinese authorities have taken a series of actions to control air pollution emission load within a permissible range. However, although China has made positive progress on tackling air pollution, these actions have not kept up with its economy growth and fossil-fuel use. The traditional single-pollutant approach is far from enough in China now, and in the near future, air pollution control strategies should move in the direction of the multiple-pollutant approach. In addition, undesirable air quality is usually linked with the combination of high emissions and adverse weather conditions. However, few studies have been done on the influence of climate change on atmospheric chemistry in the global perspective. Available evidence suggested that climate change is likely to exacerbate certain kinds of air pollutants including ozone and smoke from wildfires. This has become a major public health problem because the interactions of global climate change, urban heat islands, and air pollution have adverse effects on human health. In this chapter, we first review the past and current circumstances of China's responses to air pollution. Then we discuss the control challenges and future options for a better air quality in China. Finally, we begin to unravel links between air pollution and climate change, providing new opportunities for integrated research and actions in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, 74 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510080, China. huangcr@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cunrui", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, 74 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510080, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, 74 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510080, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Suhan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, 74 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510080, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, 74 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510080, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, 74 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510080, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yiling", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "legislation & jurisprudence", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "legislation & jurisprudence", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Government Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Health Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Policy Making"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29177966", "10.1007/978-981-10-5657-4_11"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
