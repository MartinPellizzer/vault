In experiments on rats with infected skin wounds it was shown that wound drainage with ozone-perfluorane complex led to 1 month period of inflammatory-necrotic process subsiding and partial or complete wound epithelization. In animals with infected defects of femoral bone under the influence of ozone-perfluorane complex in the bone wound there was seen consequent (from the beginning of experiment to each successive term) inflammation intensity reduction. In the forefront the processes of reparative osteogenesis, differentiation and secondary rebuilding of newly formed bone structures came out. Local use of ozone-perfluorane complex in the region of infected apical periodontium in experiments on dogs gave expressed positive effect with sharp reduction of inflammatory infiltrate intensity and extension in periodontal tissues and full disappearance of destructive manifestations; the processes of injured apical periodontal tissues organization were developed with signs of their sclerotization. As the result of reparative osteogenesis process activation the intensive formation of new bone tissue happened that led to periodontal groove constriction in the periapical region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grigor'ian", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grigor'iants", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guchetl'", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Stomatologiia (Mosk)", "NlmUniqueID": "0412072", "ISSNLinking": "0039-1735"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Femur"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteonecrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Infection"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18454111"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
