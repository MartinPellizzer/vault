Weekly median hourly O(3) concentration and the corresponding weekly cumulative integral (sum of all hourly concentrations within the week) were used as indicators of weekly O(3) spectral density and coherence with the change in weekly alfalfa height growth. In general, the weekly cumulative integral performed much better than the weekly median O(3) concentration. A conceptual analysis of the results is presented, along with a recommendation that crop growth stage-based cumulative integrals merit further evaluation towards a better understanding of cause-effect relationships."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Minnesota, 495 Borlaug Hall, 1991 Buford Circle, St Paul, Minnesota 55108, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krupa", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nosal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092384", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90112-7", "0269749189901127"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
