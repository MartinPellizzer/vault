This lidar is located at an elevation of 2300 m in the San Gabriel Mountains, Southern California, and has been in operation since January 1988. Evaluation of the results obtained from this system has been provided through an inter-comparison campaign, carried out during October/November 1988, and through long term comparison with SAGE II satellite measurements. This paper describes the implementation of the system and its operation, including the procedures for data analysis. Examples of ozone profiles measured and inter-comparisons with measurements made by other instruments are presented which show that the lidar is capable of producing high quality ozone measurements up to at least 45-km altitude."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDermid", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Godin", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walsh", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20577486", "10.1364/AO.29.004914", "38103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
