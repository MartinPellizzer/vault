Herein, we studied the bioaerosol (fluorescent particle) dynamics on both haze and sunny days in Beijing from Dec. 2013 to March 2014 by employing a widely used real-time bioaerosol sensor-ultraviolet aerodynamic particle spectrometer (UV-APS). Firstly, we studied the fluorescent particle (BioPM) concentration and size distributions during three independent haze and three independent sunny days. Secondly, we investigated BioPM dynamics over a two-week long monitoring period which included consecutive haze days and alternated sunny days. In addition, we analyzed bacterial community structures and endotoxin levels in the air samples using pyrosequencing and Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) method, respectively. More than 6-fold higher fluorescent particle concentrations up to 5\u00d710(5)/m(3) with peaks at night or early dawn were detected at the time of haze occurrences than those observed on sunny days. When the haze episode progressed for 3-5days, the BioPM concentrations were observed to decrease to the levels that were typically observed on sunny days. In general, ozone levels were found to be elevated at noon, while BioPM, NOx and relative humidity were reduced. Gene sequence analysis revealed no significant difference in abundances and community structures for top 13 bacterial genera between haze and sunny days, yet about twice higher endotoxin levels (12.4EU/m(3)) were detected on haze days than on sunny days. The results here facilitate a better understanding of atmospheric fluorescent particle dynamics including those under haze events."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
