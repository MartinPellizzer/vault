Due to the potential risk toward public health, regulations are becoming increasingly strict and classical treatments like biological treatments are not efficient. Other techniques such as incineration, oxidation or adsorption provide higher levels of removal but with a high energy and capital cost. A coupled process involving adsorption and oxidation is studied. Four adsorbents are tested and compared according to two objectives, their adsorption capacity and their capability to decompose ozone into powerful hydroxyl radicals. Two model compounds were chosen: 2,4-dichlorophenol and nitrobenzene. Experimental results allow comparing coupled process with results obtained during ozonation alone. Zeolite (Faujasite Y) gave disappointing results in term of both adsorption kinetics and ozone decomposition. On the contrary, activated carbons showed fast adsorptions and important capabilites to decompose ozone into radicals, almost in nitrobenzene experiments. S-23 activated carbon proved to be the most interesting adsorbent for better mechanical and chemical stabilities over time. Sequential adsorption/ozonation experiments were conducted, showing a strong loss of adsorption efficiency after the first operation, but the positive point is that the adsorption capacity remains almost constant during further cycles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, LISBP, UMR INSA/CNRS 5504 & UMR INSA/INRA 792, 135 Avenue de Rangueil, 31077, Toulouse Cedex 4, France. tony.merle@insa-toulouse.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merle", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pic", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manero", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Debellefontaine", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19934514", "10.2166/wst.2009.711"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
