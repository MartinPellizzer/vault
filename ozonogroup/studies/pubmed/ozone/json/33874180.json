Whiteface Mountain, NY at an elevation of 1090 m, represents a red spruce population in decline, while Millinocket and Howland, Maine are at 518 and 105 m above sea level, respectively, and have red spruce stands that show no symptoms of decline. The Millinocket site with saplings that are 15-20 yr old was compared with the Howland site with 60-yr-old trees to test the effect of age on antioxidant levels. The Howland site was compared with the Whiteface Mountain site, which has trees more than 100 yr old, to test the effects of air quality and elevation. Foliage developed in 1987 (87 needles) and in 1988 (88 needles) was sampled from May to November and from July to November, 1988, respectively. Quadratic polynomial and linear regressions were used to model the relationships through time of each variable measured. Regression coefficients were obtained by one-way analysis of variance. The means for total glutathione and oxidized glutathione were higher at Whiteface Mountain in 87 needles, and needles of both age classes sampled in November had significantly higher oxidized glutathione at Whiteface Mountain compared to those at Howland. No significant difference was observed in the mean ascorbate content of either needle class at all the three sites. The activity of superoxide dismutase declined with time in 87 needles at Whiteface Mountain and the mean activity was lower at Whiteface Mountain than at Howland. The effects of ozone concentration, site elevation and other environmental factors on seasonal changes in antioxidant levels and superoxide dismutase activity are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology, and Weed Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madamanchi", "ForeName": "Nageswara R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology, and Weed Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hausladen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology, and Weed Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alscher", "ForeName": "Ruth G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amundson", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fellows", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Barnes, J.
