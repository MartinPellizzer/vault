Supported-catalyst CuO/AC was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N<sub>2</sub>-physisorption, scanning electronic microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The degradation was mainly evaluated by chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>), biodegradability and toxicity. Compared with unsupported-catalyst CuO or the mixed system of activated-AC and unsupported-catalyst CuO, supported-catalyst CuO/AC with reduced cost exhibited significantly enhanced activity for degrading HORW (5.0\u00a0g CuO-5%/AC, 90\u00a0mg/L O<sub>3</sub>, and 7.3 pH). TEM analysis showed that the high activity of supported-catalyst CuO-5%/AC might be ascribed to the fact that CuO particles were small and highly dispersed on AC. Mass spectrum spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that the organic components in HORW were first degraded to small molecule oxidation products, which were then oxidized or mineralized further. The influence of CuO loading, CuO/AC dose, ozone dose and initial pH on the degradation efficiency was also investigated. The results of the present work showed that CuO/AC could be a promising supported-catalyst for catalyzing ozonation degradation of HORW."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 610500, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. wangwx923@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 650100, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. wangwx923@163.com."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1725-0415"], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Weixing", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 650100, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 650100, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Lingzhi", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "PL1128", "Agency": "State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V1XJQ704R4", "NameOfSubstance": "cupric oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Benitez J (2002) Principles and modern applications of mass transfer operations.
