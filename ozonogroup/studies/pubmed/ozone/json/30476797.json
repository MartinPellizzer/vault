Results revealed that \u03b1-Fe(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)OOH is a nano magnetic material with goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH) -type structures and has fewer Lewis acid of Fe<sup>3+</sup> on its surface. Moreover, \u03b1-Fe(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)OOH was effective in catalytic ozonation of 4-chloronitrobenzene (4-CNB), which is a probe contaminant that cannot be efficiently removed through sole ozonation. The removal of 4-CNB increased with ozone concentration and \u03b1-Fe(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)OOH dosage, but decreased with the presence of carbonate, sulfate and phosphate. The catalytic activity of \u03b1-Fe(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)OOH also showed a dependence on solution pH. The presence of humic acid accelerated 4-CNB removal at low concentration but inhibited the removal at high concentration. In comparison with \u03b1-FeOOH, \u03b1-Fe(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)OOH significantly enhanced hydroxyl radicals generation and reduced Fe ions release in this process. The hydroxyl groups of Fe<sup>3+</sup> on \u03b1-FeOOH and \u03b1-Fe(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)OOH surface was active site for ozone decomposition into hydroxyl radicals. Introducing Fe<sup>2+</sup> significantly increased the density of surface hydroxyl groups relative to \u03b1-FeOOH. This enhancement significantly promoted hydroxyl radicals generation and 4-CNB degradation in the solution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
