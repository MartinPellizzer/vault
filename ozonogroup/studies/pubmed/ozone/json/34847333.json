The current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, in contrast, expose the American public to pollution levels that are known to result in significant morbidity and mortality. <b>Objectives:</b> To provide county-level estimates of annual air pollution-related health outcomes across the United States using the most recent federal air quality data, and to support the ATS's recent update to the long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> recommended standard. This study is presented as part of the annual ATS/Marron Institute \"Health of the Air\" report. <b>Methods:</b> Daily air pollution values were obtained from the EPA's air quality system for monitored counties in the United States from 2017-2019. Concentration-response functions used in the EPA's regulatory review process were applied to pollution increments corresponding to differences between the rolling 3-year design values and ATS-recommended levels for long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> (8 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> (25 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), and ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>; 60 ppb). Health impacts were estimated at the county level in locations with valid monitoring data. <b>Results:</b> Meeting ATS recommendations throughout the country prevents an estimated 14,650 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8,660-22,610) deaths; 2,950 (95% CI, 1,530-4,330) lung cancer incidence events; 33,100 (95% CI, 7,300-71,000) morbidities, and 39.8 million (95% CI, 14.6-63.3 million) impacted days annually. This prevents 11,850 more deaths; 2,580 more lung cancer incidence events; 25,400 more morbidities; and 27.2 million more impacted days than meeting EPA standards alone. <b>Conclusions:</b> Significant health benefits to be gained by U.S. communities that work to meet ATS-recommended air quality standards have now been identified under scenarios meeting the new ATS recommendation for long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> (8 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). The \"Health of the Air\" report presents an opportunity for air quality managers to quantify local health burdens and EPA officials to update their standards to reflect the latest science."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7745-2780"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marron Institute of Urban Management and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Grossman School of Medicine, New York University, New York, New York."}], "LastName": "Cromar", "ForeName": "Kevin R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0406-9684"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marron Institute of Urban Management and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Grossman School of Medicine, New York University, New York, New York."}], "LastName": "Gladson", "ForeName": "Laura A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6553-3826"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Hicks", "ForeName": "E Anne", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1481-9036"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon; and."}], "LastName": "Marsh", "ForeName": "Brenda", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "American Thoracic Society, Washington, District of Columbia."}], "LastName": "Ewart", "ForeName": "Gary", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Am Thorac Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "101600811", "ISSNLinking": "2325-6621"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "7"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34847333", "10.1513/AnnalsATS.202107-860OC"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
