The WRF-Chem model was used to simulate a typical regional ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution event in Foshan, and the four-dimensional flux method was applied to quantify the transport fluxes of ozone and its precursors from the surrounding areas to Foshan and to clarify the contributions of the direct transport of ozone and transport of precursors. The average ozone flux from the surrounding areas to Foshan was 120.3 t\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>, the volatile organic compound (VOCs) flux was 30.2 t\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>, and the corresponding ozone formation potential (OFP) was 114.8 t\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>. By counting the transport fluxes of each ozone pollution event, it was found that the city with the largest ozone flux into Foshan during the pollution period was Guangzhou (contributed 44%); the city with the largest input VOCs flux was Zhaoqing (contributed 48%). The analysis of ozone generation potential due to transported VOCs emissions found that oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) contributed the most to OFP, accounting for 47% of the \"maximum input events.\" OVOCs and aromatic hydrocarbons such as formaldehyde, xylenes, aldehydes, acetone, and phenols were the top five species contributing to the OFP, contributing more than 50% of the total OFP, mainly from industrial solvent sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Li-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Hai-Hua", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li-Ting", "Initials": "LT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zi-Jiong", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Guo-Tong", "Initials": "GT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Yu-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Station of Guangdong Province, Foshan 528000, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Si-Xin", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Station of Guangdong Province, Foshan 528000, China."}], "LastName": "Situ", "ForeName": "Shu-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37694621", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205205"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
