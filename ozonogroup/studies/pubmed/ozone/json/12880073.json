Since the mid-1990s, average daily maximum O3 levels have been higher on weekends than on weekdays throughout most of the area. We used the Comprehensive Air-Quality Model with extensions to investigate causes of weekday/weekend O3 differences in the LA area for August 3-7, 1997, from the Southern California Ozone Study. Weekday/weekend emission changes were estimated, because explicit weekend inventories are not yet available from regulatory agencies. Changes to on-road motor vehicle (MV) emissions were derived from observed weekday/weekend traffic differences. The estimated changes in MV emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) were a 5% increase on Friday, a 27% decrease on Saturday, and a 37% decrease on Sunday, relative to Monday-Thursday levels. The corresponding changes in MV volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions were an 8% increase on Friday, an 8% decrease on Saturday, and a 15% decrease on Sunday. Modeling these MV emissions changes explained the observed weekend O3 effect very well. Furthermore, changes to the mass of MV NOx emissions were the main contributor to O3 differences rather than changes to the timing of MV emissions. Ozone increases on weekends were caused by NOx emission decreases, because O3 formation is strongly VOC-limited throughout most of the LA area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environ Corp., Novato, California 94945, USA. gyarwood@environcorp.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yarwood", "ForeName": "Greg", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stoeckenius", "ForeName": "Till E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heiken", "ForeName": "Jeremy G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dunker", "ForeName": "Alan M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12880073", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466232"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
