Contaminated berries and surfaces were immersed in ozonized water or exposed to PDT-curcumin for different time intervals. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess the effects of the treatments on MS2 viral particles. The MS2 inactivation by ozone and PDT-curcumin varied with the fruit and the surface tested. Ozone reduced the MS2 titer up to 3.6 log PFU/g in black mulberry and 4.1 log PFU/g in pitanga. On surfaces, the MS2 reduction by ozone reached 3.6 and 4.8 log PFU/cm<sup>2</sup> on glass and stainless steel, respectively. PDT-curcumin reduced the MS2 3.2 and 4.8 log PFU/g in black mulberry and pitanga and 2.7 and 3.3 log PFU/cm<sup>2</sup> on glass and stainless steel, respectively. MS2 particles were disintegrated by exposure of MS2 to ozone and PDT-curcumin on pitanga. Results can contribute to establishing effective practices for controlling NoV in fruits and surfaces, estimated based on MS2 bacteriophage behavior."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
