Degradation rates of ozonation alone, ceramic honeycomb and modified ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation in tap water increased by 4.90%, 2.47% and 5.12% than those in distilled water respectively. The removal rate of ozonation alone increased by 6.25% with the increase of the concentration of magnesium ion (0 to approximately 8 x mg x L(-1)), but those of other two processes decreased by 11.41% and 17.64%, respectively, under the same experimental condition. Degradation efficiency of ozonation alone, ceramic honeycomb and modified ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation decreased by 4.42%, 9.38% and 12.24%, respectively, with the increase of the concentration of chloride ion (0 to approximately 40 mg x L(-1)). At the lower concentration, humic acid could accelerate the degradation of nitrobenzene, however, the reaction was retarded at higher concentrations of humic acid. The experiment also studied the influences of the applied ozone and initial concentration of nitrobenzene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16686190"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
