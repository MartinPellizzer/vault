The results showed that \u2460 during the 17 years, the tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentration steadily increased, reached the maximum value in 2010, and then showed a fluctuating and undulating state. NO<sub>2</sub> showed an increasing trend from 2005 to 2012 and slowly decreased from 2012 to 2021. The average HCHO concentration showed an increasing trend from 1.15\u00d710<sup>16</sup>molec\u00b7cm<sup>-2</sup> in 2005 to 1.8\u00d710<sup>16</sup> molec\u00b7cm<sup>-2</sup> in 2021. \u2461 In terms of spatial characteristics, the concentrations of the three pollutants generally showed a pattern of high concentration in the north and low concentration in the south, with a high concentration in the north, uncharacteristic concentration in the middle, and low concentration in the south. \u2462 The sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> was as follows:<i>\u03b7</i><2.3 in spring, which belonged to the VOCs control area; <i>\u03b7</i><4.2 in summer, showing that most areas were NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-VOCs coordinated control areas and a few areas were VOCs control areas; <i>\u03b7</i><4.2 in autumn, which was primarily controlled by VOCs, with a few of them being NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-VOC synergistic control areas; and <i>\u03b7</i><2.3 in winter, which was a VOCs-controlled area. VOCs were primarily controlled in Shandong Province. \u2463 Owing to the high concentration of O<sub>3</sub> in Shandong Province from 2005 to 2021, Jinan, the capital city of Shandong Province in 2021, was selected for ozone source analysis. The O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased in Jinan in 2021 owing to two aspects. First, the long-distance air transportation primarily originated from Lianyungang City in Jiangsu Province and Cangzhou City in Hebei Province. Second, the close air mass transport originated from the pollution of cities near Jinan and the economic zones of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, and the aggregation analysis results corresponded with those of the potential source contribution factor algorithm (PSCF) and the weighted trajectory analysis (CWT)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Min-Xia", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yi-Kai", "Initials": "YK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37699800", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202210122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
