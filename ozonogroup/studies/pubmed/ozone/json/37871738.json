The results showed that the average concentration of surface VOCs was 49.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030.1\u00a0ppbv, alkanes and aromatics were the main components. Notably, a very large discrepancy in VOCs was obtained between the wet (71.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025.9\u00a0ppbv) and dry (25.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0\u00a0ppbv) episodes, which was attributed to the atmospheric stability and diffusion capacity. Moreover, the total VOC (TVOCs) concentration declined under fluctuations, but it rapidly increased with height in the afternoon during the wet episode (2.50\u00a0ppbv/100\u00a0m, R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.47). According to the PMF results, combustion was the dominant emission source, additionally, the contribution of solvent coating in the wet episode and the background in the dry episode increased with height. Moreover, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased with height, and the decrease in L<sub>NOx-OH</sub> could effectively prevent the occurrence of high O<sub>3</sub> values. This study indicated that low wind speeds and high humidity levels highly likely cause the accumulation of atmospheric VOCs under static and stable conditions, while the control of high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations must still greatly consider summertime NOx emissions in Lhasa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
