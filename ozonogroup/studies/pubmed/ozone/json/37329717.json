However, due to the difficulty in measuring transient O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> concentrations, this hypothesis has not been verified under realistic ozonation conditions during water treatment. In this study, a probe compound was used in combination with kinetic modeling to evaluate the role of O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition during ozonation of synthetic solutions with model promotors and inhibitors (methanol and acetate or tert-butanol) and natural waters (one groundwater and two surface waters). By measurement of the abatement of spiked tetrachloromethane (as a O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> probe), the O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> exposure during ozonation was determined. Based on the measured O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> exposures, the relative contribution of O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> to O<sub>3</sub> decomposition, in comparison to OH<sup>-</sup>, <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, and dissolved organic matter (DOM), was quantitatively evaluated using kinetic modeling. The results show that water compositions (e.g., the concentration of promotors and inhibitors, and the O<sub>3</sub> reactivity of DOM) have a considerable effect on the extent of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>-promoted radical chain reaction during ozonation. In general, the reaction with O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> accounted for \u223c59\u201270% and \u223c45\u201252% of the overall O<sub>3</sub> decomposition during ozonation of the selected synthetic solutions and natural waters, respectively. This confirms that O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> plays a critical role in promoting O<sub>3</sub> decomposition to <sup>\u2022</sup>OH. Overall, this study provides new insights on the controlling factors for ozone stability during ozonation processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
