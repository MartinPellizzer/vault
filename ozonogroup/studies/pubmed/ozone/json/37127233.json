Moreover, limitation exists in the current metrics for long-term regional ozone risk assessment, AOT40 (the accumulated hourly ozone over a threshold of 40\u00a0ppbv) and POD<sub>Y</sub> (phytotoxic ozone dose over a threshold of Y nmol ozone m<sup>-2</sup> PLA s<sup>-1</sup>), with ignorance of meteorological influence for the former and complicated data collection and calculation procedures for the latter. Here, we developed a new metric for ozone-induced risk on winter wheat, O3MET, which can be easily derived based on ozone concentrations and meteorological variables, and is suitable for long-term assessment of ozone-induced wheat loss at the regional scale. Combining with existing metric for forest (O3RH), we comprehensively quantified the ozone damages on winter wheat yield and forest gross primary production (GPP) for mainland China during 2010-2021, the period with fast growth of ozone level across the country. The annual average losses of wheat yield and forest GPP were estimated at 26.5\u00a0Mt and 552.6 TgC, accounting for 17% and 4% of the total yield and GPP without ozone impact, respectively. Heavy dual ozone-induced damages on both wheat and forest were presented in East and South China. The ozone-induced wheat yield loss and forest GPP loss were estimated to increase at a rate of 1.8\u00a0Mt/yr and 13.9 TgC/yr for the entire country, respectively, driven mainly by the enhanced ambient ozone level within the research period. Besides ecological impact, the ozone pollution in the developed eastern China resulted in serious health burden as well, thus effective actions on ozone pollution alleviation in the region is crucial for reducing its ecological and health risks simultaneously."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
