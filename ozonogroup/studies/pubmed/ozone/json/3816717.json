However, most of these utilities are changing their disinfectants without evaluating chemical impacts. Therefore, a research cooperative agreement was developed with Jefferson Parish, LA, to evaluate four parallel streams treated with four different disinfectants (chlorine, monochloramine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone.) These streams, along with a fifth parallel stream, which was not treated with a disinfectant (control), were passed through both sand and granular activated carbon (GAC). Ozonation reduced the total organic carbon (TOC) and total organic halide (TOX) concentration by 0.3 mg/L and 10 micrograms/L, respectively. The average concentration of TOC for the other disinfectants was comparable to that associated with the nondisinfected stream (3.3 mg/L). The average instantaneous TOX concentration for chlorine dioxide, chloramine, and chlorine disinfection after 30 min contact time increased by 60, 92, and 238 micrograms/L, respectively, from a nondisinfected concentration of 25 micrograms/L. The volatile organics most affected by disinfection (chlorination) were the trihalomethanes. No significant change in concentration was noted after disinfection for the other volatile organics evaluated, such as 1,2-dichlorethane, dichloromethane, trichloroethylene, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, and carbon tetrachloride. Ozonation produced an average concentration reduction of 11 to 84% for most of the nonvolatiles evaluated. Conversely, a concentration increase of 43 to 100% was noted, after chlorination, for some of the nonvolatile organics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lykins", "ForeName": "B W", "Initials": "BW", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koffskey", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8061YMS4RM", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorine dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KW8K411A1P", "NameOfSubstance": "chloramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3816717", "PMC1474313", "10.1289/ehp.8669119"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
