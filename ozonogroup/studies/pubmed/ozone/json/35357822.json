Here, we identified, using iodometry-assisted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, a large suite of isomer-resolved peroxide monomers (C<sub>8-10</sub>H<sub>12-18</sub>O<sub>5-8</sub>) and dimers (C<sub>15-20</sub>H<sub>22-34</sub>O<sub>5-14</sub>) in secondary organic aerosol formed from ozonolysis of the most abundant monoterpene (\u03b1-pinene). Combining aerosol isothermal evaporation experiments and multilayer kinetic modeling, bulk peroxides were found to undergo rapid particle-phase chemical transformation with an average lifetime of several hours under humid conditions, while the individual peroxides decompose on timescales of half an hour to a few days. Meanwhile, the majority of isomeric peroxides exhibit distinct particle-phase behaviors, highlighting the importance of the characterization of isomer-resolved peroxide reactivity. Furthermore, the reactivity of most peroxides increases with aerosol water content faster in a low relative humidity (RH) range than in a high RH range. Such non-uniform water effects imply a more important role of water as a plasticizer than as a reactant in influencing the peroxide reactivity. The high particle-phase reactivity of organic peroxides and its striking dependence on RH should be considered in atmospheric modeling of their fate and impacts on aerosol chemistry and health effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ziyue", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chenxi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Huayun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1245-0119"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto Ontario M5S 3E5, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shunyao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7392-4237"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto Ontario M5S 3E5, Canada."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Arthur W H", "Initials": "AWH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1157-5101"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35357822", "10.1021/acs.est.2c01297"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
