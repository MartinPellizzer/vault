We aimed to explore the link between high temperatures and emergency kidney disease hospital admissions across 12 Texas Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) from 2004 to 2013, considering causes, age groups, and ethnic populations.", "To investigate the correlation between high temperatures and emergency hospital admissions, we utilized MSA-level hospital admission and weather data. We employed a Generalized Additive Model to calculate the association specific to each MSA, and then performed a random effects meta-analysis to estimate the overall correlation. Analyses were stratified by age groups, admission causes, and racial/ethnic disparities. Sensitivity analysis involved lag modifications and ozone inclusion in the model.", "Our analysis found that each 1\u00a0\u00b0C increase in temperature was associated with a 1.73\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI [1.43, 2.03]) increase in hospital admissions related to all types of kidney diseases. Besides, the effect estimates varied across different age groups and specific types of kidney diseases. We observed statistically significant associations between high temperatures and emergency hospital admissions for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) (3.34\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI [2.86, 3.82])), Kidney Stone (1.76\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI [0.94, 2.60])), and Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) (1.06\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI [0.61, 1.51])). Our research findings indicate disparities in certain Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). In Austin, Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas metropolitan areas, the estimated effects are more pronounced for African Americans when compared to the White population. Additionally, in Dallas, Houston, El Paso, and San Antonio, the estimated effects are greater for the Hispanic group compared to the Non-Hispanic group.", "This study finds a strong link between higher temperatures and kidney disease-related hospital admissions in Texas, especially for AKI. Public health actions are necessary to address these temperature-related health risks, including targeted kidney health initiatives. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms and address health disparities among racial/ethnic groups."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
