The recruited PMNs, in turn, can release toxic mediators and produce lung injury. The mechanism of ozone-induced changes in lung permeability remains unknown. It is our hypothesis that PMNs migrating into the lung play a significant role in the pathophysiology following O3 exposure and that increasing the number of PMNs coming into the lung will exaggerate the changes in lung permeability. To test this hypothesis, we induced an influx of PMNs into the lungs of Sprague-Dawley rats by intratracheal instillation of 1% rabbit serum and then exposed the animals to either 0.8 ppm O3 or filtered air for 3 h. Control animals were intratracheally instilled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and simultaneously exposed to O3 or filtered air in the same manner as the serum-treated animals. The animals were sacrificed and the lungs lavaged 10-12 h after exposure. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed for albumin and protein, as indicators of permeability. In addition, BALF from the various groups was tested for its ability to alter epithelial resistance of pulmonary type II cells in culture. O3 exposure resulted in a significant increase in albumin and protein levels in the BALF as compared to air-exposed controls. The instillation of serum resulted in a significant increase in airway PMNs, but no significant elevations in albumin levels in both the O3 and air-exposed groups, as compared to PBS instillation. In vitro studies did not reveal a differential BALF effect on epithelial resistance. The data demonstrate that an excessive neutrophilia in the lung is not matched by a comparable amplification of epithelial injury. It is therefore suggested that a simple elevation in PMN number in the air spaces, as that induced by serum instillation, does not necessarily augment the lung pathophysiology, but that a more complex interaction with O3 may be required for cellular activation and release of toxic products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.
