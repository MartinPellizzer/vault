The concentrations of personal and outdoor ozone ranged from not detectable to 23.2 ppb and from 4.7 to 38.3 ppb, respectively. The mean concentration of personal exposure to ozone was 3.7 ppb and was significantly lower than that of outdoor ozone (18.5 ppb). This suggests that the concentrations of outdoor ozone affect personal ozone exposure. However, in this study, we found no correlation between the concentrations of personal ozone and the total time spent outdoors or the time of day the individual was outside. In contrast, the mean concentrations of outdoor ozone were similar to those of ozone measured at the 12 nearest Ambient Monitoring Stations (AMSs). However, when the AMS was situated near a main road, the regional ozone levels were underestimated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Hyogo College of Medicine, 1-1 Mukogawa-cho, Nishinomiya 663-8501, Japan. tang@hyo-med.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoda", "ForeName": "Yoshiko", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Otani", "ForeName": "Naruhito", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kameda", "ForeName": "Takayuki", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toriba", "ForeName": "Akira", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayakawa", "ForeName": "Kazuichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shima", "ForeName": "Masayuki", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Housing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22863698", "10.1248/cpb.c12-00105", "DN/JST.JSTAGE/cpb/c12-00105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
