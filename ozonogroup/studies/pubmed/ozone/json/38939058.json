It is often associated with a sedentary lifestyle. The leading cause of its development is also a functional disorder of the intestine and chronic constipation. To date, there is a steady growth rate of this disease, leading to its \"rejuvenation\". The current stage of development indicates the need for further improvement of surgical treatment and optimisation of patient management methods and the creation of uniform standards of care for this contingent of patients.", "To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the use of platelet-rich plasma therapy and the biologically active substance \"ozoyl\" in the treatment of haemorrhoidal disease.", "The main group included 100 patients with chronic haemorrhoids who were operated on in the period from March 2021 to March 2022. For this group, autoplasma was used during surgery, and an ozoyl-based drug in the postoperative period. The remaining 100 participants of this study, assigned to the control group, underwent a conventional haemorrhoidectomy operation and standard patient management using a hydrophilic ointment based on chloramphenicol.", "After the conducted clinical studies, it was established that in the main group, the pain syndrome decreased by about 30%, considering the period from the first day of the postoperative period compared to the control group. The postoperative wound healed in the main group in the third week after the operation, unlike the control group, in which this event was noted in the fourth week. The patients did not complain during the examination 3 months later.", "This study is of practical significance because haemorrhoidal disease today has a high prevalence, and an integrated approach is required for the treatment of such patients.
