In this study, different amounts of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were added in the impregnation solution of the filters of passive samplers and the effect on the absorption of ozone studied. The results of the measurement of ozone with varying amounts of SWCNTs added to the impregnation solution of the filters of the passive samplers were compared with the results of the continuous ozone measurement system (CS). Measurements were performed for 7 days and 14 days at two different exposure times. The increase of the amount of SWCNTs on the filters of the passive samplers, however, did not have an effect on the measurement of ozone. The measurement results of the passive samplers of the 14-day exposure periods, alternating with the 7-day exposure periods, were lower considerably than the results of the 7-day exposure.", "The accuracy and the use of passive samplers in SWCNTs are expected to provide high measurement results. Observing the effect of the change in the amount of diffusion of pollutants held in the SWCNT is also one of the expected implications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Engineering , Ondokuz Mayis University, Kurupelit Campus , Samsun , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Akdemir", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27572419", "10.1080/10962247.2016.1184192"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
