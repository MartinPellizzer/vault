Alkyne-functionalized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (alkynyl-PNIPAM), prepared a priori by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), was used for the click reaction with the azido-containing PGMA side chains of the PVDF-g-P[GMA-(N3)(OH)] copolymer to give rise to the thermoresponsive PVDF-g-P[GMA-click-PNIPAM] copolymer. Both the PVDF-g-P[GMA-(N3)(OH)] and PVDF-g-P[GMA-click-PNIPAM] copolymers can be readily cast into microporous membranes by phase inversion in an aqueous medium. The PVDF-g-P[GMA-(N3)(OH)] microporous membranes with azido-containing surfaces could be further functionalized via surface click reaction with alkyne-terminated PNIPAM of controlled chain lengths to obtain the PVDF-g-P[GMA-click-PNIPAM]surface microporous membranes. The surface composition and morphology of the PVDF-g-P[GMA-click-PNIPAM] membranes can be adjusted by the temperature of casting medium, while the flux through both types of membranes exhibits thermoresponsive behavior."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore 119260."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neoh", "ForeName": "K G", "Initials": "KG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "E T", "Initials": "ET"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teo", "ForeName": "S L M", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21341769", "10.1021/la2001514"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
