Young I. aquifolium plants received an episode of either charcoal-filtered air or charcoal-filtered air with 70 nl l(-1) O(3) added for 7 h d(-1) over a 28 day period from June 15th 1996, then placed into ambient environment, Stoke-on-Trent, U.K. Data were collected per leaf cohort over the next three growing seasons. Ozone exposure significantly increased leaf loss and stomatal conductance and reduced leaf production over all subsequent seasons. Impact of the initial ozone stress was still detected in leaves that had no direct experimental ozone exposure. This study has shown the potential of ozone to introduce long-term phenological perturbations into ecosystems by influencing productivity over a number of seasons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Sciences, Staffordshire University, College Road, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire ST4 2DE, UK. jon.ranford@staffs.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ranford", "ForeName": "Jonathan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reiling", "ForeName": "Kevin", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ilex"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16713048", "10.1016/j.envpol.2006.02.032", "S0269-7491(06)00248-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
