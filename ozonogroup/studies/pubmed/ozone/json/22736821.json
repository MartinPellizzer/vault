Because of the current phasing out of methyl bromide, investigations on the use of ozone gas as a soil-fumigant were conducted. Ozone gas was produced at a concentration of 1% in air by a conventional electrical discharge O\u2083 generator. Two O\u2083 dosages and three gas flow rates were tested on a sandy loam soil collected from a tomato field that had a resident population of root knot nematodes, Meloidogyne javanica. At dosages equivalent to 50 and 250 kg of O\u2083/ha, M. javanica were reduced by 24% and 68%, and free-living nematodes by 19% and 52%, respectively. The reduction for both M. javanica and free-living nematodes was dosage dependent and flow rate independent. The rates of O\u2083 mass transfer (OMT) through three soils of different texture were greater at low and high moisture levels than at intermediate ones. At any one soil moisture level, the OMT rate varied with soil texture and soil organic matter content. Results suggest that soil texture, moisture, and organic matter content should be considered in determining O\u2083 dosage needed for effective nematode control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nematology, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Jinya Jack", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Westerdahl", "ForeName": "Becky B", "Initials": "BB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pryor", "ForeName": "Alan", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "J Nematol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884299", "ISSNLinking": "0022-300X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Alder MC, Hill GR.
