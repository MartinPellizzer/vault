The successful photochemical indicators are: 0<sub>3</sub>/NO , 0<sub>3</sub>/NO<sub>z</sub> (where NO<sub>z</sub> = NO<sub>y</sub>-NO<sub>x</sub>), 0<sub>3</sub>/HN0<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub>/HN0<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub>z</sub>. Results of Urban Airshed Model (UAM-IV) simulations for Atlanta, GA, New York, NY, and Los Angeles, CA, show that high values of these species ratios are correlated with NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive chemistry and low values are associated with reactive organic gases (ROG)-sen-sitive chemistry. Correlations between measured 0<sub>3</sub> and NO in Atlanta and between 0<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>z</sub> in Los Angeles are consistent with theory and reflect the difference between likely NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive chemistry in Atlanta and hydrocarbon-sensitive chemistry in Los Angeles. Measured 0<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and NO are used to evaluate model performance during two air pollution events in Atlanta and Los Angeles. The performance evaluation includes model scenarios for each city with different anthropogenic and biogenic emission rates and different NO<sub>x</sub>-ROG sensitivity predictions. Simulations with different NO<sub>x</sub>-ROG chemistry are found to give similar predictions for peak ozone but different values for photochemical indicators. Comparison with measured values of photochemical indicators provides a more stringent test of model performance than evaluation versus observed ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sillman", "ForeName": "Sanford", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences , University of Michigan , Ann Arbo , Michigan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Dongyang", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta , Georgia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cardelino", "ForeName": "Carlos", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Atmospheric Sciences Department , Tennessee Valley Authority , Muscle Shoals , Alabama."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imhoff", "ForeName": "Robert E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28445117", "10.1080/10962247.1997.11877500"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
