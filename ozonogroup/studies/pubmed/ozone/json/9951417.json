The data obtained were analyzed in terms of diurnal and annual variation. Indications were found of the strong impact of the mountain-valley circulation system, which ventilates and considerably cleans the air in Mendoza. The data are discussed in comparison with air pollution in the German city of Leipzig. In Mendoza, the high concentration of precursors and the strong solar radiation contribute to high levels of ozone. In fact, monitoring reveals considerably lower concentrations than in Leipzig, owing to the diluting effect of local meteorology. The low-level jet is mainly active during the summer. It lowers the peak mid-day ozone concentration and produces a temporary concentration increase at night. The Environmental Protection Agency standard of a maximum one-hour mean concentration of 0.250 mg ozone/m3 (125 ppb) is never reached, and the World Health Organization standard of 0.113 mg ozone/m3 (56.5 ppb) is only rarely exceeded during winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UFZ-Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig-Halle Ltd., Department of Human Exposure Research and Epidemiology, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlink", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herbarth", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richter", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rehwagen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puliafito", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puliafito", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puliafito", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guerreiro", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu\u00e9ro", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Behler", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Argentina"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9951417", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463780"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
