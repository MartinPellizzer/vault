Those peroxides are broken down by redox-coupling reaction, and provide active species that initiate grafting by reaction with the collagen molecules. The surface density of generated peroxide on a PLLA surface was determined by an iodide method. The maximum concentration of peroxide was about 2.87 x 10(-8) mol/cm2 when ozone oxidation was performed at 60 V for 60 min. After the surface oxidation, type I atelocollagen was grafted onto PLLA surface. All physical measurements on the collagen-grafted surface indicated that the PLLA surface was effectively grafted with type I atelocollagen. Behavior of rat calvaria osteoblasts on type I atelocollagen grafted PLLA (PLLA + COL) surface was observed. Initial attachment of osteoblasts on the surface was significantly enhanced, and it is assumed that the atelocollagen matrix supported the initial attachment and growth of cells. Collagenous protein synthesis of osteoblasts was maintained at relatively low level in the early stage of proliferation due to the primarily existing grafted type I atelocollagen, and then increased in 7 days as the osteoblast differentiated. After 7 days, collagenous protein synthesis in osteoblasts was activated. Alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity and mineralization by osteoblasts were promoted on PLLA + COL surface. In comparison with PLLA + COL, non-treated PLLA and tissue culture plate (TCPS) did not show any feature expressed in osteoblasts' maturation up to 9 days in this experiment. The grafted type I atelocollagen provided a favorable matrix for cell migration in relation with collagenase expression. Ozone oxidation might be a favorable method for surface modification of PLLA membranes by collagen grafting, and cell behavior could be modulated by the grafted collagen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Engineering, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biomaterials", "NlmUniqueID": "8100316", "ISSNLinking": "0142-9612"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyesters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "atelocollagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "459TN2L5F5", "NameOfSubstance": "poly(lactide)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyesters"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11197497", "10.1016/s0142-9612(00)00177-0", "S0142-9612(00)00177-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
