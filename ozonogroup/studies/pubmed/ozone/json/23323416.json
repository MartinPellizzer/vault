In order to find an economically reasonable and practical technology, the research on the removal efficiency of different concentration wastewater containing PVA by ozonation-activated sludge process was studied, and the result was compared with the traditional activated sludge process. The results showed that the ozonation-activated sludge process was not suitable for treating influent with COD below 500 mg x L(-1) and the wastewater PVA concentration was 10-30 mg x L(-1). When the influent COD was between 500-800 mg x L(-1) and the PVA concentration was 15-60 mg x L(-1), the system had advantages on dealing with this kind of wastewater, and the average removal efficiency of COD and PVA were 92.8% and 57.4%, which were better than the traditional activated sludge process 4.1% and 15.2% respectively. In addition, the effluent concentrations of COD could keep between 30-60 mg x L(-1). When the influent COD was 1 000-1 200 mg x L(-1) and the PVA concentration was 20-70 mg x L(-1), the average removal efficiencies of COD and PVA were 90.9% and 45.3%, which were better than the traditional activated sludge process 12.8% and 12.1% respectively, but the effluent should to be further treated. Compared with the traditional activated sludge process, ozonation-activated sludge process had high treatment efficiency, stable running effect, and effectively in dealing with industrial wastewater containing PVA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China. yefan323@163.com"}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qiong", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Lan", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyvinyl Alcohol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polyvinyl Alcohol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23323416"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
