The O<sub>3</sub> pollution characteristics were analyzed comprehensively; the O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-VOCs sensitivities and key precursors were determined, and the control strategies for O<sub>3</sub> pollution were carried out. The results were as follows:1 O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Haikou mainly occurred in September and October, with daily maximum 8-h O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the range of 39-190 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the daily variation in O<sub>3</sub> was unimodal, peaking at approximately 14:00. 2 The concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs were higher during O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes than their respective mean values in Haikou City. The increased O<sub>3</sub> precursor concentrations were an important factor leading to O<sub>3</sub> pollution, whereas O<sub>3</sub> pollution was also influenced by regional transport, with pollutants mainly transported from the northeastern part of Haikou City. 3 O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-VOCs sensitivity in Haikou City was in the VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> transitional regime, and the most sensitive precursors in various months were different. O<sub>3</sub> formation in September was sensitive to anthropogenic VOCs the most; however, in October it was sensitive to NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>. 4 In the future, the reduction ratio of VOCs to NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> should be 1:1-4:1 to control O<sub>3</sub> pollution effectively in Haikou."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Shu-Yan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haikou 571126, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Rong-Fu", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Huo", "ForeName": "Si-Si", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Li-Ao", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hong-Jin", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Dang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haikou 571126, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-Shuai", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haikou 571126, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Qiao", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qing-Zhu", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-Xing", "Initials": "WX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "31"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37973086", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202211141"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
