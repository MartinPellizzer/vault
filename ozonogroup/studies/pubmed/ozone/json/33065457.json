The influence of various parameters including Sn source, type of capping and alkaline agents, and calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of the SnO<sub>2</sub> preparations was investigated. The SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles prepared by tin tetrachloride as Sn source, NaOH as gelatin agent, CTAB as capping agent and at calcination temperature of 550\u202f\u00b0C (SnNaC-550) exhibited the maximum performance in the catalysis of ACT. The optimized catalyst (SnNaC-550) had spherical-homogeneous and cubic-shaped nanocrystalline particles with 5.5\u202fnm mean particle size and a BET surface area of 81\u202fm<sup>2</sup>/g, which resulted in 98% degradation and 84% mineralization of 50\u202fmg/L ACT at 20 and 30\u202fmin reaction time, respectively when combined with ozonation (COP). Based on the radical scavenger experiments, <sup>\u2022</sup>OH was the major oxidizing agent involved in the removal of ACT. LC/MS analysis showed that short-chain carboxylic acids were the main intermediates. Furthermore, the SnNaC-550 catalytic activity was preserved after four successive cycles. Collectively, the new method has the potential to efficiently synthesize stable and reusable SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles to catalyze the ozonation of ACT from aquatic environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
