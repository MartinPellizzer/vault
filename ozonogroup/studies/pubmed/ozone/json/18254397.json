Ozonation in the rotating packed contactor has been shown to be feasible for achieving nearly complete decomposition of o-cresol within 1 hour. The decomposition of o-cresol by ozonation in the rotating packed contactor increased with increasing rotor speed and decreasing the gas-liquid flowrate ratio. However, the reduction of total organic carbon during the ozonation of o-cresol was not influenced by variation of rotor speed and gas-liquid flowrate ratio. The species distribution of o-cresol under various solution conditions plays a significant role in determining the decomposition behavior. In most experiments conducted in this study, the decomposition of o-cresol by ozonation was more favorable under alkaline conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan. ku508@mail.ntust.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "Young", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Yan-Shiun", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hua-Wei", "Initials": "HW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cresols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YW84DH5I7U", "NameOfSubstance": "2-cresol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cresols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18254397", "10.2175/106143007x220905"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
