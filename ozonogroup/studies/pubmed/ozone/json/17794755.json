The measured rate coefficients at 298 and 277 kelvin were approximately 20 and approximately 15%, respectively, lower than earlier values. These results will increase the tropospheric OH concentrations derived from the CH(3)CCI(3) budget analysis by approximately 15%. The predicted atmospheric lifetimes of species whose main loss process is the reaction with OH in the troposphere will be lowered by 15% with consequent changes in their budgets, global warming potentials, and ozone depletion potentials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Talukdar", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmoltner", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watson", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montzka", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ravishankara", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17794755", "10.1126/science.257.5067.227", "257/5067/227"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
