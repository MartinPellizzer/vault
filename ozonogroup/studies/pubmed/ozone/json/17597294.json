Soil column experiments were performed on eight different soils in order to investigate the effects of soil properties, such as soil organic matter (SOM) and soil texture on the survival and regrowth of indigenous microorganisms after in situ ozonation. Indigenous microorganisms were found to be very sensitive to ozone in the soil column experiments. The microbial fatality revealed a linear relationship with the SOM content in the range of 1.72-2.42% of SOM content, whereas water content was poorly correlated. Four weeks of incubation of ozone-treated soil samples allowed for the regrowth of indigenous microorganisms with inverse relation to ozonation time. The regrowth was also significantly influenced by the SOM content in the same soil texture. Oxidation and removal rate of hexadecane was affected by particle size distribution. Especially, sand exhibited the highest oxidation rate of hexadecane, which resulted from having the lowest SOM content, water content, and surface area with respect to the other samples. The soil samples ozonated for 90-180 min were determined to exhibit the lowest concentration of hexadecane, with the exception of sand, after 4 weeks of incubation. This study provided insight into the influence of SOM and soil texture on indigenous microbial potential to degrade hexadecane in integrated ozonation and biodegradation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Management Corporation, Environmental Research Complex, Kyungseo-Dong, Seo-gu, Incheon 404708, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Haeryong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "Kyu-Dong", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neppolian", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Heechul", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "F8Z00SHP6Q", "NameOfSubstance": "n-hexadecane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17597294", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.05.032", "S0304-3894(07)00755-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
