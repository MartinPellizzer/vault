A landing Typhoon Ampil during July 17-24, 2018 was studied herein to characterize the surface O<sub>3</sub> anomalies during its movement over NCP. Landing typhoons present large negative O<sub>3</sub> anomalies at the center of the typhoon and positive O<sub>3</sub> anomalies 600-1700 km away from the center. During the northwest movement of Typhoon Ampil to the NCP, the area and magnitude of both positive and negative O<sub>3</sub> anomalies shrank, particularly in the western and northern periphery, where the typical diurnal change of O<sub>3</sub> dissipated with nocturnal O<sub>3</sub> enhancement in the NCP. The spatiotemporal patterns of surface O<sub>3</sub> anomalies in the NCP were induced significantly during various stages of typhoon movement with a stable structure in the atmospheric boundary layer, strong solar radiation on sunny days, and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) in the typhoon periphery, depending on the changing intensity, distance, and orientation of the typhoon center. Among them, the STT played a considerable role and contributed 32% to the positive anomalies of surface O<sub>3</sub> in the NCP. Under the influence of westerly jets and high pressure at mid-latitudes on the typhoon movement, strong wind convergences in the upper troposphere were formed intensifying the downdraft of O<sub>3</sub>-rich stratospheric air to the boundary layer in the NCP with an asymmetrical distribution of surface positive O<sub>3</sub> anomalies over the periphery of typhoon. This study could improve our understanding of regional ozone changes with meteorological influences."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
