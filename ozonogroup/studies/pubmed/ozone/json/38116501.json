The associated health impacts have been well reported in temperate regions. In Singapore, key climate change adaptation measures and activities include coastal and flood protection, and mitigating heat impacts. We systematically reviewed studies examining climate variability and air quality with population health in Singapore, a tropical city-state in South-East Asia (SEA), with the aim to identify evidence gaps for policymakers. We included 14 studies with respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular outcomes, foodborne disease and dengue. Absolute humidity (3 studies) and rainfall (2 studies) were positively associated with adverse health. Extreme heat (2 studies) was inversely associated with adverse health. The effects of mean ambient temperature and relative humidity on adverse health were inconsistent. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone were positively associated with adverse health. Climate variability and air quality may have disease-specific, differing directions of effect in Singapore. Additional high quality studies are required to strengthen the evidence for policymaking. Research on effective climate action advocacy and adaptation measures for community activities should be strengthened.", "There was no funding source for this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pre-hospital and Emergency Research Centre, Programme in Health Services and Systems Research, Duke-NUS Medical School, 8 College Road, 169857, Singapore."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Environment Agency, 40 Scotts Road #13-00, 228231, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Aik", "ForeName": "Joel", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Tahir Foundation Building, 12 Science Drive 2 #10-01, 117549, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Ang", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human Potential Translational Research Programme, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 10 Medical Drive, Block MD 11, #03-10, 117597, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Gunther", "ForeName": "Samuel H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Climate Change Secretariat (Singapore), Prime Minister's Office, 100 High Street, The Treasury, 179434, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Charissa", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human Potential Translational Research Programme, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 10 Medical Drive, Block MD 11, #03-10, 117597, Singapore."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heat Resilience and Performance Centre, National University of Singapore, 27 Medical Drive #03-01, 117510, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jason K W", "Initials": "JKW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Tahir Foundation Building, 12 Science Drive 2 #10-01, 117549, Singapore."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, 10 Medical Drive, 117597, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Seow", "ForeName": "Wei Jie", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lancet Reg Health West Pac", "NlmUniqueID": "101774968", "ISSNLinking": "2666-6065"}, "CoiStatement": "We declare no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Celik S.
