The results showed that the maximum daily 8-h moving mean (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) in western and northern cities in Hainan Island was higher than that in the central, eastern, and southern cities. O<sub>3</sub>-8h was the highest in 2015, and O<sub>3</sub>-8h exceeding the standard proportion was the largest in 2019. In addition, O<sub>3</sub>-8h was positively correlated with average temperature (<i>P</i><0.1), sunshine duration (<i>P</i><0.01), total solar radiation (<i>P</i><0.01), atmospheric pressure, and average wind speed and was negatively correlated with precipitation (<i>P</i><0.05) and relative humidity. The satellite remote sensing data showed that the tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> column concentration (NO<sub>2</sub>-OMI) and HCHO column concentration (HCHO-OMI) displayed opposite trends in Hainan Island from 2015 to 2020. Compared with those in 2015, NO<sub>2</sub>-OMI increased by 7.74% and HCHO-OMI decreased by 10.2% in 2020. Moreover, Hainan Island belongs to the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> control area, and the FNR value exhibited a fluctuating downward trend in the past 6 years, with a trend coefficient and climatic trend rate of -0.514 and -0.123 a<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. A strong correlation was observed between meteorological factors and the FNR value of Hainan Island."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China Sea Meteorological Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Hainan Province, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Chuan-Bo", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China Sea Meteorological Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Hainan Province, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Jin-He", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haikou 571126, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-Shuai", "Initials": "WS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37699799", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202209233"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
