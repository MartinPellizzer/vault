The health risk associated with the consumption of drinking water coming from contaminated sources was unknown. A study was undertaken to evaluate treatment plants' capacity to treat cyanotoxins below the maximum recommended concentrations of 1.5 microg/L microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and the provisional concentration of 3.7 microg/L anatoxin-a, respectively. The results showed that close to 80% of the water treatment plants are presently able to treat the maximum historical concentration measured in Quebec (5.35 microg/L MC-LR equ.). An increase, due to climate change or other factors, would not represent a serious threat because chlorine, the most popular disinfectant, is effective in treating MC-LR under standard disinfection conditions. The highest concentration of anatoxin-a (2.3 microg/L) measured in natural water thus far in source water is below the current guideline for treated waters. However, higher concentrations of anatoxin-a would represent a significant challenge for the water industry as chlorine is not an efficient treatment option. The use of ozone, potassium permanganate or powder activated carbon would have to be considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "D\u00e9partement des G\u00e9nies Civil, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, G\u00e9ologique et des Mines, C.P.6079, Succursale Centre-Ville, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec H3C 3A7, Canada. annie.carriere@polymtl.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carri\u00e8re", "ForeName": "Annie", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pr\u00e9vost", "ForeName": "Mich\u00e8le", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zamyadi", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chevalier", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barbeau", "ForeName": "Benoit", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Water Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101185420", "ISSNLinking": "1477-8920"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quebec"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20375475", "10.2166/wh.2009.207"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
