Ozonated (5 mg/liter) and chlorinated tap water were used to wash alfalfa seeds for 30 min. After washing in the ozonated tap water, the AOC concentration increased 25-fold, whereas the dissolved ozone decreased to undetectable levels. The AOC levels for the chlorinated water after washing the seeds also increased. These increases are due to ozone's strong oxidizing ability to break down refractory, large-molecular-weight compounds, forming smaller ones, which are readily used as nutrient sources for microorganisms. This same phenomenon was observed when using ozone in the treatment of drinking water. The AOC value increased from 1,176 to 1,758 micrograms C-eq/liter after the reconditioned wastewater was ozonated. When the ozonated wastewater was inoculated with Salmonella serotypes, the cells survived and increased generation times were observed. The increased nutrients would now become more readily available to any pathogenic microorganisms located on alfalfa seed surface as seen with the increase in the inoculated levels of Salmonella in the ozonated wastewater. If the washing process using ozonated water is not followed by the recommended hypochlorite treatment or continually purged with ozone, pathogen growth is still possible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Eastern Regional Research Center, 600 East Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania 19038, USA. krajkowski@errc.ars.usda.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajkowski", "ForeName": "Kathleen T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rice", "ForeName": "Eugene W", "Initials": "EW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Medicago sativa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15083737", "10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.813", "S0362-028X(22)03493-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
