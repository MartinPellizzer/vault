Ozone and some toxic chemicals are used to control pathogenic infections, leading to longer storage lives of agricultural commodities. However, these chemicals may pose some risks to the applicators and the environment. Therefore, alternative, easy-to-use fumigants for effective control of Fusarium infections in harvested fresh chilies are needed.", "Two endophytic fungi, Trichoderma afroharzianum strain MFLUCC19-0090 and T. afroharzianum strain MFLUCC19-0091, were isolated from Schefflera leucantha leaves. Their volatile compounds were investigated for antifungal activities against F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum. In vitro results showed that the volatile compounds produced by each strain inhibited pathogen growth. Additionally, the Trichoderma-derived volatile compounds significantly reduced Fusarium-related disease severity and incidence percentages in the inoculated fresh chilies. Antifungal properties of the volatile compounds were found to be specific to the species of the tested pathogens (MFLUCC19-0090 greatly suppressed F. oxysporum and MFLUCC19-0091 greatly suppressed F. proliferatum). Seventy-three volatile compounds were detected from both strains. Among the major volatile compounds detected, phenyl ethyl alcohol was found to possess the strongest antifungal activity against both pathogens.", "These Trichoderma-derived volatile compounds may be used as alternative fumigants for controlling Fusarium rot in harvested fresh chilies. The successful use of volatile compounds as biofumigants can prevent significant market losses and, more importantly, may reduce the health hazards caused by Fusarium-associated mycotoxin exposures among consumers. \u00a9 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Khruengsai", "ForeName": "Sarunpron", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6766-1853"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Chemical Innovation for Sustainability (CIS), Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Pripdeevech", "ForeName": "Patcharee", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4383-7129"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Exposure Assessment and Development for Environmental Research (LEADER), Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "LastName": "D'Souza", "ForeName": "Priya E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9519-1687"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Exposure Assessment and Development for Environmental Research (LEADER), Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "LastName": "Panuwet", "ForeName": "Parinya", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "RGJ PHD/0193/2560", "Agency": "Thailand Research Fund", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D4Y1CD8EH8", "NameOfSubstance": "fumigatin"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Trichoderma afroharzianum"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Araliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypocreales"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trichoderma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Nurulhuda M, Latiffah Z, Baharuddin S and Maziah Z, Diversity of Fusarium species from vegetable fruits.
