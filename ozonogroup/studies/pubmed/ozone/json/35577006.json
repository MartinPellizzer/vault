The source emission air was passively sampled by pre-vacuumized stainless steel canister and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-flame ionization detection (GC/MS-FID). The species profile of 107 VOCs in the emission processes were obtained. We calculated the photochemical ozone formation potential (OFP) and carcinogenic risk (CR) of the VOCs for each manufacture process. The results showed that mixing process mainly released dichloromethane (14.53%), carbon disulfide (CS<sub>2</sub>) (6.88%), styrene (5.72%), 4-methyl-2-pentanone (5.22%) and naphthalene (3.69%) for solvents used and raw rubber degradation in the process. The C6-C8 alkanes, especially heptane and isomers of heptane (44.71%), were dominated in shaping process. The major species released from vulcanization process were carbon disulfide (29.72%), naphthalene (8.17%), acetone (7.73%) and dichloromethane (4.26%). VOCs emitted from vulcanization process had the highest OFP, which contributed by naphthalene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene and carbon disulfide. VOCs emission from mixing process had the highest CR, and 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,2-dichlorethane and 1,3-butadiene were the main contributors to CR. We also estimated the total VOCs emissions into the atmosphere from tires manufacturing in China, which were 7.58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>\u00a0t in 2018 and contributed about 9% of total industry processes VOCs emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
