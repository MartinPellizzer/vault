Utilising the new threshold ranges for photochemical indicators, the method for determining O<sub>3</sub> formation in the Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT) module within CAMx was improved by a dynamically varied threshold of [Formula: see text] ratio. The O<sub>3</sub> concentration contributions in the newly added transition regime were apportioned to NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs emissions in proportion to the relationship between the [Formula: see text] ratio and first-order O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity. The source contributions of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations from different emission sectors from June to September 2019 were compared using the original and improved CAMx-OSAT. The results showed that the O<sub>3</sub> concentration contributions changed significantly in the NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime, with a maximum decrease of 21.89%, while the contributions increased by up to 7.57% in the VOC-limited regime, and were within 15 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> in the transition regime. The modified OSAT module enabled a more sophisticated attribution of O<sub>3</sub> to precursor emissions and may have far-reaching implications for informing O<sub>3</sub> pollution control policy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
