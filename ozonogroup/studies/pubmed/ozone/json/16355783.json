The gas exchange index and chlorophyll fluorescence, and the contents of chlorophyll and UV-absorbing compounds were examined after 50 days of the radiation. The results showed that enhanced UV-B radiation significantly lowered the maximal net photosynthetic rate (CK = 6.214, TR = 4.452), raised the dark respiration rate(CK = 0.413, TR = 1.295) and light compensation point (CK = 21.629, TR = 59.861), but had little effect on quantum yield (CK = 0.021, TR = 0.032). Under enhanced UV-B radiation, the diurnal changes in net photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, quantum efficiency of photosystem II centers (Fv/Fm), and quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (phi(pspi)) were reduced, chlorophyll a, total chlorophylls, and chlorophyll a/b (CK= 16.23, 5.39, TR = 13.17, 4.93) were also markedly reduced, but chlorophyll b remained nearly unchanged. Contrary to the previous studies, enhanced UV-B radiation decreased the content of UV-absorbing compounds (CK = 0.87, TR = 0.79) in 2-year-old Acer davidii seedling leaves, indicating that the measurement of leaf UV-B absorbing compounds didn't necessarily provide a good indicator of plant tolerance to UV-B. It could be concluded that enhanced UV-B radiation had some inhibitory effects on the photosynthesis of Acer davidii seedlings. Long-term researches are necessary to confirm this conclusion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Institute of Biology,Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China. zuoyuanyuan1982@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Yuanyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16355783"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
