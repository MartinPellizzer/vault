Formation of by-product was investigated by GC/MS for the reclaimed water. Ozone was injected into the raw wastewater in a 10 L contact tank and the wastewater was circulated through the membrane module for inner pressurized cross-flow filtration. The concentrate was returned back to the contact tank. The membrane used in this experiment was hollow fiber polysulfone UF membrane with MWCO 10,000. It has an effective filtration area of 0.06 m2. The experiment was carried out with intermittent ozone injection, 5 min injection and 10 min idling. Ozone was dosed at the concentration of 1.5 mg/L. The flux of the UF could be maintained at 0.24 m/d under filtration pressure 40-45 kPa and water temperature, 20-22 degrees C. The organic removal efficiency by the system was 90% in terms of COD. Ozone was considerably effective to degrade organics in the wastewater. Molecular weight of organics in the raw waste was mostly greater than 10,000 (72% of 950 mgCOD/L). However 86% of effluent COD (94-100 mg/L) was composed of organics smaller than MWCO 500 by ozone injection. No harmful by-products by ozone contact were detected from the analysis of treated water using GC/MS. It was identified that residual organics in the treated water were 1,1'-Oxybisbenzene, Octadecanoic acid, Squalene and Benzenmethanol, etc., which were additives contained originally in the detergent. Consequently the reclaimed water quality could be estimated safe enough to recycle for the rinsing cycle in a washing machine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Changwon National University, Sarim dong 9, Changwon, Gyeongnam 641-773, Korea. gts@changwon.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "G T", "Initials": "GT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Laundering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15537022"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
