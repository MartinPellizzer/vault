The results demonstrated that Zn(0) had a significantly synergistic role in the degradation of aniline by ozone. A complete decomposition of the initial aniline (10mgL(-1)) was achieved by ozone together with Zn(0) within 25min, and meanwhile nearly 70% of the total organic carbon in the solution was removed. The decomposition efficiency of aniline markedly increased with an increase of Zn(0) dosage. However, temperature exerted a slight impact on the degradation of aniline and the optimum removal efficiency of aniline was realized at 298K. Aniline was efficiently degraded at all the tested pHs except for 12. Free radicals were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance technique and free radical scavengers. H2O2 concentration generated during the reactions was analyzed using a photometric method. Based on the results obtained in this study, it is proposed that O2(-) instead of OH is the dominant active species responsible for the degradation of aniline. It is concluded that ozone combined with Zn(0) is an effective and promising approach to the degradation of organic pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
