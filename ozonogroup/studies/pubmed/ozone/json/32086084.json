Therefore, we assessed the responses of a semi-natural grassland community of Indo-Gangetic plains to elevated O<sub>3</sub> exposure (Ambient\u00a0+\u00a020\u00a0ppb) compared to ambient after three years of exposure using open-top chambers. Percent decreases were found in above (26%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.002) and belowground (30%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.003) biomass under elevated compared to ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Percent decrements in total organic carbon (TOC; 24%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001), total nitrogen (29%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) and available phosphorus (11%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.002) in the soil were also observed under elevated O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Exposure at elevated O<sub>3</sub> reduced soil microbial biomass and activities of \u03b2-glucosidase, amylase, urease and phosphatase, while polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase showed enhancement in their activities, showing negative effects on belowground soil health. Percent reduction in root shoot ratio (10%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) depicts that less C-allocation towards root system led to a reduction in TOC in the soil, which could affect C-sequestration under elevated O<sub>3</sub> condition in the semi-natural grasslands. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> also affected enzymes participating in N and P-cycles, causing reductions in total nitrogen and phosphorus. The study concludes that projected O<sub>3</sub> concentrations have serious implications for aboveground biomass as well as belowground soil health in tropical areas, identified as hotspots of O<sub>3</sub> in the world."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
