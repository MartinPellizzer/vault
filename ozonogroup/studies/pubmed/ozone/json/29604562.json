Total concentrations of VOCs were 72.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.7, 65.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.7, 95.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.0, and 79.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. The most abundant specie was toluene (10.1%-17.4%), followed by benzene, ethane, isopentane, ethane, acetylene, and n-butane. Seasonal variations of VOCs were analyzed, and it was found that the highest concentration occurring in summer, while the lowest in spring. For the diurnal variation, the concentration of VOCs in the daytime (9:00-15:00) was less than that at night (15:00-21:00) obviously. Ozone Formation Potential (OFP) was calculated by using Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) method. The greatest contribution to OFP from alkenes and aromatics, which accounted for 27.3%-51.2% and 36.6%-58.6% of the total OFP. The WRF-CMAQ model was used to simulate the impact of airport emissions on the surrounding area. The results indicated that the maximum impact of VOCs emissions and all sources emissions at the airport on O<sub>3</sub> was 0.035 and\u00a0-23.8\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Meanwhile, within 1\u202fkm from the airport, the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> around the airport was greatly affected by airport emitted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
