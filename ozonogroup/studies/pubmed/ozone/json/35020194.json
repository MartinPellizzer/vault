We explore the sociological underpinnings of this epidemic, including: (1) aging of the demographic; (2) human ecologic factors (residing in areas with high ambient ultraviolet levels and a depleted ozone layer); (3) large-scale European migration to more equatorial latitudes; (4) social structures that for centuries minimized miscegenation and maximized segregation; (5) gender-based differences in sunbathing, tanning, sunscreen use, and clothing choice; (6) occupational ultraviolet exposure; (7) the complex interplay of socioeconomic status, race, and urbanization on skin cancer incidence and mortality; (8) the effects of war on skin cancer incidence; (9)\u2009cultural shifts in clothing, travel, outdoor sports, recreation, and attitudes towards being tan; and (10) the indirect effects of religion.
