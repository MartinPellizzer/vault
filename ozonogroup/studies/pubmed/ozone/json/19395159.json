Kinetic data were analyzed using second order expressions for the reaction between organics and ozone or hydroxyl radicals. Catalytic runs used a commercial titanium dioxide catalyst consisting of fumed colloidal particles. The kinetic constant of the non-catalytic ozonation of clofibric acid at pH 3 was 8.16 x 10(-3)+/-3.4 x 10(-4)L mmol(-1)s(-1). The extent of mineralization during non-catalytic runs ranged from 50% at pH 7 to 20% at pH 3 in a reaction that essentially took place during the first 10-20 min. The catalyst increased the total extent of mineralization, its effect being more important during the first part of the reaction. The pseudo-homogeneous catalytic rate constant was 2.17 x 10(-2) L mmol(-1)s(-1) at pH 3 and 6.80 x 10(-1)L mmol(-1)s(-1) at pH 5, with up to a threefold increase with respect to non-catalytic constants using catalyst load of 1g/L. A set of stopped-flow experiments were designed to elucidate the role of catalyst, whose effect was probably due to the adsorption of organics on catalytic sites rather than to the promotion of ozone decomposition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, E-28871 Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Madrid, Spain. roberto.rosal@uah.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosal", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzalo", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Calvo", "ForeName": "Eloy", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Colloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53PF01Q249", "NameOfSubstance": "Clofibric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Clofibric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19395159", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.03.111", "S0304-3894(09)00512-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
