The correlation of VOCs through combination with meteorological and ground-level O<sub>3</sub> data, and the sources of VOCs were analyzed by positive matrix factorization (PMF). To quantify the pollution period of O<sub>3</sub> in summer, its temporal sequence characteristics were studied by wavelet analysis. During the sampling period, the average concentration of ambient total VOCs (TVOCs) was (137.23\u00b164.62) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Haloalkanes were the most dominant VOC compounds, accounting for 31.77% of total VOCs mass, followed by aromatic (30.97%) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs, 23.76%). The seasonal variation in VOC concentration followed the trend in winter (187.7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) > autumn (146.8 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) > spring (133.24 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) > summer (107.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>); the concentration of VOCs shows a trend of increasing gradient from west to east. The O<sub>3</sub> concentration correlated negatively with VOCs and NO<sub>2</sub>, and positively with temperature, sunshine duration, wind speed, and visibility. Changes in meteorological elements were concerned before the occurrence of ozone pollution in summer, especially in 4-5 days in June and 7-8 days during July to August after the occurrence of increasing temperature. Finally six potential sources of VOCs were quantified by the PMF model, including from gasoline emissions (24.78%), diesel vehicle emissions (24.69%), solvent usage (18.64%), the chemical industry (11.87%), regional background (10.84%), and the pharmaceutical industry (9.17%). Ozone formation potential (OFP) contribution of emission sources of gasoline and diesel vehicles (54.98%) was over half of the total contribution. Meanwhile, these findings illustrated that control of vehicle emissions and industrial sources would be an important way to reduce VOCs concentrations and improve air quality in Shijiazhuang."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jian-Sheng", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Ya-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Da-Xi", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shijiazhuang Meteorological Bureau, Shijiazhuang 050081, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng-Xuan", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xue-Chen", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33374048", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202005302"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
