Initially, ultrathin Pd nanowires with diameters of 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 nm were generated, and a method has been developed to achieve highly uniform distributions of these catalysts onto the Vulcan XC-72 carbon support. As-prepared wires are activated by the use of two distinctive treatment protocols followed by selective CO adsorption in order to selectively remove undesirable organic residues. Subsequently, the desired nanowire core-Pt monolayer shell motif was reliably achieved by Cu underpotential deposition followed by galvanic displacement of the Cu adatoms. The surface area and mass activity of the acid and ozone-treated nanowires were assessed, and the ozone-treated nanowires were found to maintain outstanding area and mass specific activities of 0.77 mA/cm(2) and 1.83 A/mg(Pt), respectively, which were significantly enhanced as compared with conventional commercial Pt nanoparticles, core-shell nanoparticles, and acid-treated nanowires. The ozone-treated nanowires also maintained excellent electrochemical durability under accelerated half-cell testing, and it was found that the area-specific activity increased by ~1.5 fold after a simulated catalyst lifetime."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794-3400, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koenigsmann", "ForeName": "Christopher", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santulli", "ForeName": "Alexander C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Kuanping", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vukmirovic", "ForeName": "Miomir B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Wei-ping", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sutter", "ForeName": "Eli", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Stanislaus S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adzic", "ForeName": "Radoslav R", "Initials": "RR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21644515", "10.1021/ja111130t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
