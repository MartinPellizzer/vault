With the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) level 2 swath product of tropospheric NO<sub>2,</sub> this study explores the temporal-spatial patterns of NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations over China's coal-fired power plants from 2005 to 2020 and investigates the evolution of its control strategy. The nationwide deployment of flue-gas denitration facilities was a critical measure to mitigate NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from coal-fired power plants, while this study externally assesses the implementation gap of their operation. Our results illustrate that, besides the impacts of economic cycles, China's control strategy experienced a dramatic transformation from an ad hoc campaign style for meeting short-term temporary targets to more sustainable, technology- and governance-centered institutional arrangements for ensuring long-term fundamental solutions. Furthermore, the satellite-based assessment may provide not only ex post evaluation, but also in-time and independent data for more effective and efficient environmental compliance monitoring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
