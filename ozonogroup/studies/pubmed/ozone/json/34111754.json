Sulfite/ferric ions [S(IV)/Fe(III)] systems eliminated 85% of 0.1\u00a0mM BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in 1\u00a0min at pH<sub>ini.</sub> 7.0, and 2.2\u00a0mg/L dissolved oxygen (DO) with rate constants (2.104\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.090\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) orders of magnitude faster than previously published advanced reduction processes. Increasing S(IV) and Fe(III) concentrations and decreasing DO and pH contributed to faster BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction likely due to enhanced reactive species. Lower anionic levels (0.5\u00a0mM) did not hinder BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction but further increases in the levels to 1.0\u00a0mM decreased their reduction. Notably, S(IV)/Fe(III) process reduced 68% of 25.6\u00a0\u03bcg/L BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in 3\u00a0min from tap water at pH<sub>ini.</sub> 7.0, 0.02\u00a0mM Fe(III), and 1.0\u00a0mM\u00a0S(IV), meeting drinking water standard (<10\u00a0\u03bcg/L). Also, ~99% of irons could be removed after the following activated carbon treatment. Moreover, sulfite radicals formed by S(IV) activation with Fe(III) were significant reactive species in the S(IV)/Fe(III) system. Reduction pathways were proposed accordingly. Collectively, S(IV)/Fe(III) process is a viable technology for reductively decontaminating realistic waters, especially when applied between the ozone-activated carbon process (i.e., the ozone-S(IV)/Fe(III)-activated carbon process)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
