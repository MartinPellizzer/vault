The results showed that the emission amount of anthropogenic VOCs in Shanxi province in 2013 was 723700 t, with the major sector of the industrial emission and vehicle emission, accounting for 36.47% and 24.28% of total emission amount, respectively. Coke and chemicals production, the major emission source of VOCs in industrial emission, emitting 190600 t and 38800 t VOCs in 2013, accounting for 72.22% and 14.72% of industrial emission, respectively. The emission amount of ozone precursor VOCs was 435900 t, and the total amount of ozone formation potential in Shanxi province in 2013 was 1769900 t. The sources of the greatest contribution to total ozone were vehicle emission, combustion sources and industrial emission. The results indicated that industrial emission was the major source of VOCs emission, which showed the simplification and heavy industrial structure. The increasing numbers of vehicles led to the huge emission of VOCs in recent years. In conclusion, the main measure of controlling the ozone pollution caused by VOCs emissions was controlling the VOCs emission from industrial emission and vehicle emission."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan 030024, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yu-Long", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan 030024, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Chemical Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964656", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201606055"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
