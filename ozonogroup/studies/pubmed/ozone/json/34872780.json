Second-order rate constants for reactions of the parabens with ozone and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH were [Formula: see text] =\u200910<sup>7</sup> - 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and [Formula: see text] =\u2009(2.3 - 4.3)\u00d7\u200910<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH 7. Species-specific [Formula: see text] values of the protonated and deprotonated parabens were closely related to phenol ring substituent effects via quantitative structure-activity relationships with other substituted phenols. The UV photolysis rate of the parabens [k<sub>UV</sub> =\u2009(2.4\u2009- 7.2)\u00d7\u200910<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>] depended on the halogenation state of the paraben and solution pH, from which species-specific quantum yields were also determined. In simulated treatments of drinking water and wastewater effluent, the parabens were efficiently eliminated during ozonation, requiring a specific ozone dose of >\u20090.26 gO<sub>3</sub>/gDOC for >\u200997% degradation. During UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment with 10\u2009mg\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the degradation levels were >\u200990% at a UV fluence of 2000\u2009mJ\u2009cm<sup>-2</sup>, except for Cl,Cl-methylparaben.
