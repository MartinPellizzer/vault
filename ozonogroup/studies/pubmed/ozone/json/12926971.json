The theoretical calculations predict the following: (i) other than the 18-valence-electron azomethine ylide and ozone, the 16-valence-electron nitrile ylide and nitrile imine are the best candidates for experimentalists to try; (ii) upon 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, a 1,3-diople molecule is di-sigma-bonded to a pair of carbon atoms on the sidewall of SWNT, forming a five-membered ring surface species; (iii) the as-formed 1,3-dipole-SWNT bonding is much weaker than that in the products of the molecular 1,3-DC reactions and can be plausibly broken by heating at elevated temperatures; (iv) the sidewalls of the armchair (n,n) SWNTs (n = 5-10) are subject to the 1,3-DCs of ozone and azomethine ylides; (v) both the 1,3-DC reactivity and retro-1,3-DC reactivity are moderately dependent on the diameters of SWNTs, implying the feasibility of making use of the heterogeneous 1,3-DC chemistry to purify and separate SWNTs diameter-specifically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces & Center for Theoretical Chemistry, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. xinlu@xmu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Nanqin", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qianer", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12926971", "10.1021/ja034662a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
