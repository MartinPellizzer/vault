Removal extent of mutagen precursor was evaluated by the mutagen formation potential (MFP) which is mutagenicity of pollutants capable of forming mutagens when chlorinated under the conditions of water purification processes. 77% of the MFP reduction extent for a wastewater from a university was achieved by activated sludge treatment. However, no significant reduction of the MFP was observed for wastewater from food industry, a landfill leachate and mold extract. The Fenton oxidation treatment and ozone treatment are able to remove mutagen precursors from the mold extract and the wastewater from a university, respectively. 90% of the MFP reduction extent was achieved for the mold extract by the Fenton treatment. 54% of the MFP reduction extent was achieved for a sewage by the ozone treatment. Using the oxidation treatments, biodegradability of mutagen precursors in the mold extract and sewage was improved. From the viewpoint of treatment cost, the oxidation treatments should be oriented to the improvement of biodegradability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Kagoshima University, 1-21-40 Korimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takanashi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mayumi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirata", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hano", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenton's reagent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12523783"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
