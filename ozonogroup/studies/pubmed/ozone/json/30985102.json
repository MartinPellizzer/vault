The reaction rate of SMX with KMnO<sub>4</sub> is slow, and the adsorption efficiency of biochar for SMX was inferior (less than 11% in 30 min). By adding biochar powder into SMX solution with the addition of permanganate, the oxidation ratio of SMX surged to 97% in 30 min, and over 58% of the total organic carbon (TOC) was simultaneously removed. KMnO<sub>4</sub> interacted with biochar and resulted in the formation of highly oxidative intermediate manganese species, which transformed SMX into hydrolysis products, oxygen-transfer products, and self-coupling products. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis showed that surface area, total pore volume, and micropore volume of biochar increased by 32.1%, 36.4%, and 80.6%, respectively, after reaction process. This in situ activation of biochar with KMnO<sub>4</sub> enhanced its adsorption capacity and led to great improvement of TOC removal. Besides KMnO<sub>4</sub> oxidation, biochar also enhanced TOC removal in Mn(III) oxidation (KMnO<sub>4</sub>+ bisulfite) and ozonization of SMX. Considering that KMnO<sub>4</sub> could react with biochar and result in the formation of intermediate manganese species, while biochar can be simultaneously activated and exhibit high capacity for organic adsorption, the combination of biochar with the chemical/advanced oxidation could be a promising process for the removal of environmental pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Shi-Qi", "Initials": "SQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technology R & D Center for Environmental Engineering , Dongguan University of Technology , Dongguan 523808 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Lei", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Zhuang-Song", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xian-Shi", "Initials": "XS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hai-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2355-4244"], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0903-5547"], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "biochar"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14333-13-2", "NameOfSubstance": "permanganic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JE42381TNV", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethoxazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30985102", "10.1021/acs.est.9b00180"]}}]}
