The effects of pH and initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) value as well as addition of hydrogen peroxide on ozonation process were investigated. Total organic carbon (TOC), COD, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and aromatic content (UV254) were the parameters followed to evaluate the performance of ozonation process. Comparison of the biodegradability of selected wastewaters containing different antibiotics confirmed that the variation of biodegradability was associated with the target compound. While BOD5/COD ratio of veterinary antibiotic formulation wastewater was increased from 0.077 to 0.38 with an applied ozone dosage of 2.96 g/l, this ratio for human antibiotic I and human antibiotic II was increased from 0 to 0.1 and 0.27 respectively. Moreover the results of this investigation showed that the ozonation process is capable of achieving high levels of COD and aromaticity removals at about their natural pH values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Sciences, Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Bebek-Istanbul 80815, Turkey. balciogl@boun.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akmehmet Balcio\u011flu", "ForeName": "I\u015fil", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Otker", "ForeName": "Merih", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12656233", "10.1016/s0045-6535(02)00534-9", "S0045-6535(02)00534-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
