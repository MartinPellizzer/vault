Thirty-two 1 h sample sets were taken, each composed of a \"near-real-time\" sample analyzed by an autoGC-MS XonTech 930/Varian Saturn 2000 system, and Summa and Silco canisters. Hourly total non-methane organic carbon (TNMOC), ozone, and meteorological measurements were also made. Each canister was analyzed on the autoGC-MS system for a target list of 108 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and on a manual cryosampling GC-FID system. Comparisons were made between the collection and analysis methods. Because of the low sample loading (150-250 ppbC TNMOC), these comparisons were a stringent test of sample collection and analysis capabilities. The following specific conclusions may be drawn from this study. Reasonable precision (within 15% mean difference of duplicate analyses from the same canister) can be obtained for analyses of target VOCs at low-ppbC concentrations. Relative accuracy between the GC-MS and GC-FID analysis methods is excellent, as demonstrated by comparisons of analyses of the same canisters, if measurements are sufficiently above the detection limits. This is especially significant as the GC-MS and GC-FID were independently calibrated. While statistically significant differences may be observed between the results from canister and near-real-time samples, the differences were generally small and there were clear correlations between the canister results and the near-real-time results. Canister cleanliness limits detection below the EPA Method TO-14 acceptance standard of 0.2 ppbv (0.2-2 ppbC for target analytes)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ManTech Environmental Technology Inc, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA. daughtrey.hunter@epamail.epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daughtrey", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliver", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kronmiller", "ForeName": "K G", "Initials": "KG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lonneman", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McClenny", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specimen Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11253013", "10.1039/b007158g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
