During the process, toxic transformation products (TPs) can be generated mainly via the reactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH). However, the toxicity difference between the TPs generated from O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH has not been well elucidated. In this study, we designed ozonation scenarios with different Rct values (the exposure ratio of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH to O<sub>3</sub>) via varying pH values, adding a catalyst or a radical scavenger, and investigated the degradation of a popularly used antibiotic ofloxacin (OFX). The microbial oxygen uptake, the development of zebrafish embryos, and the calculation with the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T) were applied to evaluate the toxicity of TPs generated from the above reaction scenarios. The toxicity tests demonstrated that TPs formed at high-Rct conditions were less toxic than those at low-Rct conditions. Ten and eleven TPs were identified during ozonation of OFX at pH 3 and 9, respectively, based on which the different pathways were proposed. The piperazine ring's demethylation and opening occurred at both pH values, while the hydroxylation of quinolone and oxazine mainly occurred at pH 9. The study suggests that <sup>\u2022</sup>OH might be more efficient in eliminating the toxicity of OFX than O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
