We aimed to determine if gestational PM<sub>1</sub> exposure is associated with the gut microbiota of mothers and neonates.", "Leveraging a mother-infant cohort from the central region of China, we estimated the exposure concentrations of PM<sub>1</sub> during pregnancy based on residential address records. The gut microbiota of mothers and neonates was analyzed using 16\u00a0S rRNA V3-V4 gene sequences. Functional pathway analyses of 16\u00a0S rRNA V3-V4 bacterial communities were conducted using Tax4fun. The impact of PM<sub>1</sub> exposure on \u03b1-diversity, composition, and function of gut microbiota in mothers and neonates was evaluated using multiple linear regression, controlling for nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Permutation multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to analyze the interpretation degree of PM<sub>1</sub> on the sample differences at the OTU level using the Bray-Curtis distance algorithm.", "Gestational PM<sub>1</sub> exposure was positively associated with the \u03b1-diversity of gut microbiota in neonates and explained 14.8% (adj. P\u00a0=\u00a00.026) of the differences in community composition among neonatal samples. In contrast, gestational PM<sub>1</sub> exposure had no impact on the \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity of gut microbiota in mothers. Gestational PM<sub>1</sub> exposure was positively associated with phylum Actinobacteria of gut microbiota in mothers, and genera Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Streptococcus, Faecalibacterium of gut microbiota in neonates. At Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway level 3, the functional analysis results showed that gestational PM<sub>1</sub> exposure significantly down-regulated Nitrogen metabolism in mothers, as well as Two-component system and Pyruvate metabolism in neonates. While Purine metabolism, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, Pyrimidine metabolism, and Ribosome in neonates were significantly up-regulated.", "Our study provides the first evidence that exposure to PM<sub>1</sub> has a significant impact on the gut microbiota of mothers and neonates, especially on the diversity, composition, and function of neonatal meconium microbiota, which may have important significance for maternal health management in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
