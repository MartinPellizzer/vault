The influence of pH and ozone concentration on COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), TOC (Total Organic Carbon), Absorbance at 254\u2009nm (ABS254nm), and True color was evaluated through RCCD (Rotatable Central Composite Design) experimental design, resulting in mathematical models that were statistically analyzed in <i>Statistica</i> and Design Expert software. The removals obtained was up to 26.1%, 29.9%, 56.9%, and 97.9% for COD ([COD]<sub>0</sub>=3,323\u2009mg/L), TOC ([TOC]<sub>0</sub>=1,275\u2009mg/L), ABS254nm (ABS<sub>0</sub>=32.2), and True color ([True color]<sub>0</sub>=3,467 mgPt-Co/L), respectively. Statistical and variance analysis of the experimental data revealed that one quadratic model obtained in <i>Statistica</i> was valid, ABS254nm reduction. However, by applying the Design Expert software, modified models were generated to predict the behavior of all dependent variables. Thus, the optimum point for the best response after ozonation of the landfill leachate was at the highest pH and the lowest ozone dose (9 and 2.2 mgO<sub>3</sub>/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively). Toxicity toward <i>Allivibrio fischeri</i> bacteria was abated at the same time that it decreased the impact of the effluent to Danio rerio fish (from 125 UT to 62 UT) on the treated leachate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inorganic Process Department, School of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bastos", "ForeName": "Heloisa B", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2215-9480"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inorganic Process Department, School of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Larissa L S", "Initials": "LLS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1276-1443"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Organic Process Department, School of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Chrisman", "ForeName": "\u00c9rika C A N", "Initials": "\u00c9CAN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9290-3669"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inorganic Process Department, School of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Fonseca", "ForeName": "Fabiana V", "Initials": "FV"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3988-5649"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inorganic Process Department, School of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Campos", "ForeName": "Juacyara C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal Facilities"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34842506", "10.1080/10934529.2021.2006543"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
