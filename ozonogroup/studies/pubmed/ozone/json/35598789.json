However, it is urgent to improve their long-term stability at ambient temperature, especially under the presence of water. In the present study, a modification strategy was proposed by N-doping and the successive Pd introduction. The N-doping of MnO<sub>2</sub> by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (NH<sub>4</sub>-MnO<sub>2</sub>) can increase its activity for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition. And almost 100% O<sub>3</sub> decomposition was achieved within 24\u00a0h under water-free atmosphere at ambient temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C). Successive Pd addition further promoted the water-resistance of NH<sub>4</sub>-MnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst under high humidity (RH\u00a0>\u00a090%). In combination with detailed characterizations, it indicated that the enhancements on stability and water-resistance were attributed to synergistic effect among acid sites, oxygen defects and Pd clusters. Finally, the decomposition mechanism of gaseous O<sub>3</sub> was proposed based on three decisive active sites above."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
