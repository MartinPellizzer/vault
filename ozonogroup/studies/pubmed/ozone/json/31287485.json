Here, we report an effective method to tune intrinsic n-type few-layer MoSe<sub>2</sub> to p-type through controlling precisely the ultraviolet-ozone treatment time, which can be attributed to the surface charge transfer from the underlying MoSe<sub>2</sub> to MoO<sub>x</sub> (x < 3). The resulting hole mobility and concentration are \u223c20.1 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and \u223c1.9 \u00d7 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, and the on-off ratio is \u223c10<sup>5</sup>, which are comparable to the values of pristine n-type MoSe<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the lateral p-n homojunction prepared by partially treating MoSe<sub>2</sub> displays a high rectification ratio of 2.4 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>, an ideality factor of 1.1, and a high photoresponsivity of 0.23 A W<sup>-1</sup> to the 633 nm laser at V<sub>d</sub> = 0 V and V<sub>g</sub> = 0 V due to the built-in potential in the p-n homojunction area. Our findings ensure the MoSe<sub>2</sub> p-n diode as a promising candidate for future low-power operating photodevices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Key Laboratory of Super-microstructure and Ultrafast Process, School of Physics and Electronics, Central South University, Changsha 410083, P.
