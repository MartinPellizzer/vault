'74/76'). For a growing season, plants were subjected to four N treatments, control (NC, no N addition), low N (LN, 50\u00a0kg\u00a0N ha<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup>), middle N (MN, 100\u00a0kg\u00a0N ha<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup>), high N (HN, 200\u00a0kg\u00a0N ha<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup>) and three O<sub>3</sub> treatments (CF, charcoal-filtered ambient air; NF, non-filtered ambient air; NF\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>, NF\u00a0+\u00a040\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub>). Our results showed the effects of O<sub>3</sub> and/or N on standardized ISO rate (ISO<sub>rate</sub>) and photosynthetic parameters differed along with the leaf position, with larger negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> and positive effects of N on ISO<sub>rate</sub> and photosynthetic parameters in the older leaves. Expanded young leaves were insensitive to both treatments even at very high O<sub>3</sub> concentration (67\u00a0ppb as 10-h average) and HN treatment. Significant O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0N interactions were only found in middle and lower leaves, where ISO<sub>rate</sub> declined by O<sub>3</sub> just when N was limited (NC and LN). With increasing light-saturated photosynthesis and chlorophyll content, ISO<sub>rate</sub> was reduced in the upper leaves but on the contrary increased in middle and lower leaves. The responses of ISO<sub>rate</sub> to AOT40 (accumulated exposure to hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations\u00a0>\u00a040\u00a0ppb) and POD<sub>Y</sub> (accumulative stomatal uptake of O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0Y nmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> PLA s<sup>-1</sup>) were not significant in upper leaves, but ISO<sub>rate</sub> significantly decreased with increasing AOT40 or POD<sub>Y</sub> under limited N supply in middle leaves but at all N levels in lower leaves. Overall, ISO<sub>rate</sub> changed along the vertical canopy profile in response to combined O<sub>3</sub> and N exposure, a behavior that should be incorporated into multi-layer canopy models. Our results are relevant for modelling regional isoprene emissions under current and future O<sub>3</sub> pollution and N deposition scenarios."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
