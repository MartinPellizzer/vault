However, such a strategy can compromises the landfill reduction targets while the associated environmental benefits remain so far unexplored and, in any case, any potential benefit should be evaluated for specific situations. In this study we applied material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantitatively evaluate the potential impact of phasing-out incineration in Madrid, Spain. The current MSW management system was assessed against future scenarios that describe the elimination of incineration as well as the increase of source separation, recycling, composting, and anaerobic digestion. The results revealed that incineration phase-out jeopardizes landfill reduction. However, phasing-out incineration can reduce the impact on acidification, terrestrial and marine eutrophication, photochemical ozone formation, human toxicity cancer effects, and ecotoxicity. The climate impact ranges from irrelevant to largely beneficial depending on how the biogenic carbon is considered. The transition towards a renewable electricity mix and the increase in source separation of biodegradable waste seriously compromise the climate benefits of incineration over landfilling. Overall, actions are required in order to align incineration phase-out with the landfill reduction objective, namely upgrading material recovery facilities to reduce rejects and seeking alternative pathways for the rejects that will always exist."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
