Ozone pollution and related health impacts have become severe contemporaneously. The coordinated control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone is becoming a new issue for China's air pollution control. This study quantitatively assessed the health impacts attributed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone pollution in 338 Chinese cities from 2015 to 2020 and estimated the possible health benefits from achieving dual concentration targets during 2021-2025. Results show PM<sub>2.5</sub> caused a total health impact of 2.45\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2020. All-cause and respiratory ozone-related health impact in 2020 was 1.04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> DALYs and 1.56\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> DALYs. Between 2015 and 2020, the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related health impacts decreased by 14.97%, while those ozone-related increased by 94.61% and 96.54% for all-cause and respiratory. Cities in the North China Plain have suffered higher health impacts attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone pollution, indicating that the two-pollutant coordinated control is primarily needed. By achieving aggressive concentration target (decreasing 10%) between 2020 and 2025, China will reduce the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related health impacts in 338 cities by 1.56\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> DALYs (improving 6.37%). By achieving general target (decreasing 10% or within the Interim target-1 of World Health Organization), the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related health benefit will be 7.98\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> DALYs (improving 3.25%). The deteriorating ozone health risks will also be improved. Controlling air pollution in large cities and regional center cities can achieve remarkable health benefits. Due to the inter-region, inter-province, and inter-city difference of health impacts, targeted and differentiated pollution prevention and control need to be implemented."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
