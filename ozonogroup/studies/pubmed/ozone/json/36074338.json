Sanitization of footwear such as shoes, socks/stockings, and other textiles is integral to the prevention of recurrence and reduction of spread for superficial fungal mycoses. The goal of this review was to examine the available methods of sanitization for footwear and textiles against superficial fungal infections. A systematic literature search of various sanitization devices and methods that could be applied to footwear and textiles using PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE was performed. Fifty-four studies were found relevant to the different methodologies, devices, and techniques of sanitization as they pertain to superficial fungal infections of the feet. These included topics of basic sanitization, antifungal and antimicrobial materials, sanitization chemicals and powder, laundering, ultraviolet, ozone, nonthermal plasma, microwave radiation, essential oils, and natural plant extracts. In the management of onychomycosis, it is necessary to think beyond treatment of the nail, as infections enter through the skin. Those prone to onychomycosis should examine their environment, including surfaces, shoes, and socks, and ensure that proper sanitization is implemented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "*Mediprobe Research Inc, London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Medicine, Division of Dermatology, University of Toronto School of Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Aditya K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "*Mediprobe Research Inc, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Simkovich", "ForeName": "Aaron J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "*Mediprobe Research Inc, London, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "Deanna C", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Podiatr Med Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "8501423", "ISSNLinking": "1930-8264"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatomycoses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Onychomycosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Shoes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36074338", "10.7547/21-223", "21-223"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
