These two catalysts were prepared by precipitation methods. Iron oxide has a higher surface area (330 m(2)/g) than manganese oxide (53 m(2)/g). In the absence of ozone, the removal efficiencies of PCDD/Fs achieved with iron oxide or manganese oxide were between 83% and 85%, while the destruction efficiencies were only between 20% and 25% at 180 degrees C. It indicates that adsorption was the main removal mechanism of PCDD/Fs over these two catalysts. On the other hand, ozone addition greatly enhanced the catalytic activity of iron oxide or manganese oxide catalysts on the oxidation of gaseous PCDD/Fs. At 180 degrees C, the destruction efficiencies of gaseous PCDD/Fs achieved with iron oxide or manganese oxide with 100 ppm O(3) exceeded 90%. It indicates that catalytic ozonation achieved with iron oxide or manganese oxide is effective in decomposing PCDD/Fs and the application of ozone lowers the reaction temperature of PCDD/F oxidation below 200 degrees C. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of iron oxide and ozone is superior to that of manganese oxide due to the fact that the surface of iron oxide has more hydroxyl groups, which easily form hydrogen bonds with ozone and decompose to form atomic oxygen for the further reaction with dioxin molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hou Chuan", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Shu Hao", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "Pao Chang", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Jyh Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Moo Been", "Initials": "MB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1K09F3G675", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "64J2OA7MH3", "NameOfSubstance": "manganese oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18996645", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.09.093", "S0304-3894(08)01402-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
