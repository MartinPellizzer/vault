It is well-known that photodissociation of ozone is key for the conversion of ozone into OH radicals. In the present study, using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulation, we have shown that on the surface of the droplet and ice, ozone can dissociate without light. In addition, the dissociation time of ozone is found to be much less on the ice surface than the same time on the water droplet. As the dissociation of ozone on the water surface can happen during the day as well as in the night time, we believe this route of forming OH radicals can be even more important than the photodissociation. The present study suggests that the cloud and ice surface can enhance the oxidizing power of the troposphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur, Jaipur, 302017,India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Amit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9870-6858"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur, Jaipur, 302017,India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Pradeep", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37965752", "10.1021/acs.jpca.3c02854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
