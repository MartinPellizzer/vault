The intermediate morphologies of MnTiO<sub>3</sub> nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods, and nanodiscs are trapped kinetically by adjusting the synthesis conditions. This approach enables us to elucidate the growth mechanisms of MnTiO<sub>3</sub> nanosheets based on the tetraethylammonium cation adsorption abilities on different MnTiO<sub>3</sub> crystal facets combined with density functional theory calculations. Dissolution and recrystallization processes are involved during the MnTiO<sub>3</sub> crystallization. The surface-controlled MnTiO<sub>3</sub> has been found to be effective as a catalyst for ozonation in the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). Within typical experimental conditions (catalyst dosage = 0.3 g L<sup>-1</sup>, [4-CP]<sub>0</sub> = 50 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, [O<sub>3</sub>] = 20 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, gas flow = 0.1 L min<sup>-1</sup>, pH 6.8, and T = 293 K), the total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency of 4-CP in catalytic ozonation with well-structured MnTiO<sub>3</sub> (MnTiO<sub>3</sub>-180-10 sample) was 76.3% after 60 min, compared with only 22.1 and 38.5% TOC removal in the absence of catalyst and with uncontrolled MnTiO<sub>3</sub> (MnTiO<sub>3</sub>-no TEAH sample), respectively. Benefiting from the high exposure percentage of {0001} facet, mixed-valences of manganese, surface hydroxyl groups, and the enrichment Lewis acid sites provided by Mn and Ti, the morphology-controlled MnTiO<sub>3</sub> nanosheets can be applied as heterogeneous catalytic ozonation catalysts which exhibit excellent pollutant degradation. We anticipate that MnTiO<sub>3</sub> can be a promising candidate material for the application in remediation of organic pollutants in water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Da", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Haodan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0903-5547"], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xiaohui", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment , Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin 150090 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Jingyao", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment , Zhejiang University of Technology , Hangzhou 310032 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9904-9223"], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30146877", "10.1021/acsami.8b11132"]}}]}
