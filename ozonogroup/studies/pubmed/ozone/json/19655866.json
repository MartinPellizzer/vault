The 1D intrinsic reaction coordinate model mimics the ozone open --> cyclic ring isomerization along the minimum energy path that successively connects the ozone cyclic ring minimum, the transition state (TS), the open (global) minimum, and the dissociative O(2) + O asymptote on the O(3) ground-state (1)A(') potential energy surface. Energetically, the cyclic ring isomer, the TS barrier, and the O(2) + O dissociation channel lie at approximately 0.05, approximately 0.086, and approximately 0.037 hartree above the open isomer, respectively. The molecular orientation of the modeled ozone is held constant with respect to the laser-field polarization and several optimal fields are found that all produce nearly perfect isomerization. The optimal control fields are characterized by distinctive high temporal peaks as well as low frequency components, thereby enabling abrupt transfer of the time-dependent wave packet over the TS from the open minimum to the targeted ring minimum. The quick transition of the ozone wave packet avoids detrimental leakage into the competing O(2) + O channel. It is possible to obtain weaker optimal laser fields, resulting in slower transfer of the wave packets over the TS, when a reduced level of isomerization is satisfactory."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kansai Photon Science Institute, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Kizugawa, Kyoto 619-0215, Japan. kurosaki.yuzuru@jaea.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurosaki", "ForeName": "Yuzuru", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Artamonov", "ForeName": "Maxim", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "Tak-San", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rabitz", "ForeName": "Herschel", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19655866", "10.1063/1.3185565"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
