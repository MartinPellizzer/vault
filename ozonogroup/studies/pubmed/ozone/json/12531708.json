Ozone rapidly degraded aniline from soil under moist soil conditions, 5% (wt). Removal of 77-98% of [UL-14C]-aniline was observed from soil columns (15 ml, i.d. = 2.5 cm), exposed to 0.6% O(3) (wt) at 200 ml/min after 4 min. Initial ozonation products included nitrosobenzene and nitrobenzene, while further oxidation led to CO(2). Ring-labeled-[UL-14C]-trifluralin removal rates were slower, requiring 30 min to achieve removals of 70-97%. Oxidation and cleavage of the N-propyl groups of trifluralin was observed, affording 2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-aniline, 2,6-dinitro-N-propyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-benzamine, and 2,6-dinitro-N-propyl-N-acetonyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-benzamine. Base solutions revealed that trifluralin was similarly oxidized to CO(2), where 72-83% of the activity recovered comprised 14CO(2). Use of ozone-rich water improved contaminant removal in trifluralin-amended soil columns, but did not improve removal in aniline, pentachloroaniline, hexachlorobenzene amended soil columns, suggesting that ozonated water may improve contaminant removal for reactive contaminants of low solubility."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Program, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L Martin Hall, College Park, MD 20742-3021, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierpoint", "ForeName": "Anthony C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hapeman", "ForeName": "Cathleen J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torrents", "ForeName": "Alba", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C8BX46QL7K", "NameOfSubstance": "Trifluralin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SIR7XX2F1K", "NameOfSubstance": "aniline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trifluralin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12531708", "10.1016/s0045-6535(02)00635-5", "S0045-6535(02)00635-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
