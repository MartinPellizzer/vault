Along with increased leisure time, outdoor recreational sports, and sun bathing has come greater exposure to the sun. The cumulative effects of unprotected sun exposure coupled with the changes in the ozone layer have resulted in a large photodamaged population and an epidemic of the most dangerous skin cancer, malignant melanoma. Photodamage begins early, with a child's first unprotected sun exposure. Clinical studies show that 50% of an individual's ultraviolet light exposure occurs before the age of 18 years. This damage from acute and chronic ultraviolet light exposure has produced the explosion of skin cancers. Over the next 4 years, it is expected that skin cancer will become the most common type of cancer, and malignant melanoma will become the leading cause of death from skin cancer. This growing hazard to the public has profound medical and psychological ramifications. This paper will focus on prevention, identification, evaluation and treatment of photodamage to skin, as well as skin cancer. Special emphasis will be given to the National Skin Cancer Prevention Education Program."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bergfeld", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Fertil Womens Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9706778", "ISSNLinking": "1534-892X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}], "NumberOfReferences": "20"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9160214"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
