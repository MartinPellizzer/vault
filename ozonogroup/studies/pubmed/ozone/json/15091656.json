Fumigations took place during bud break, stem elongation and bud set. Following each growing cycle, gas exchange parameters and dry weights were determined. The ozone fumigations did not produce any effect on seedling growth. The ozone fumigation effects on gas exchange parameters were inconsistent, and generally not statistically different, with no differences occurring between seed sources. There was no correlation between photosynthetic rates and seedling growth. These results provide no evidence that ozone may be contributing to the differences in decline noted between the Mt Rogers and Mt Mitchell populations of Fraser fir."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, Physiology and Weed Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seiler", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyszko", "ForeName": "P B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chevone", "ForeName": "B I", "Initials": "BI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091656", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)90047-7", "0269749194900477"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
