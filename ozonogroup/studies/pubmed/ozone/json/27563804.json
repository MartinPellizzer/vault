However, some studies have reported that the grain boundaries of TMDs can be easily degraded by the presence of oxygen in water and by UV irradiation, ozone, and heating under ambient conditions. We herein demonstrate the photodegradation of WSe2 and MoSe2 by laser exposure (532 nm) and the subsequent prevention of this photodegradation by encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layers. The photodegradation was monitored by variation in peak intensities in the Raman and photoluminescence spectra. The rapid photodegradation of WSe2 under air occurred at a laser power of \u22650.5 mW and was not observed to any extent at \u22640.1 mW. However, in the presence of a water droplet, the photodegradation of WSe2 was accelerated and took place even at 0.1 mW. We examined the encapsulation of WSe2 with h-BN and found that this prevented photodegradation. However, a single layer of h-BN was not sufficient to fully prevent this photodegradation, and so a triple layer of h-BN was employed. We also demonstrated that the photodegradation of MoSe2 was prevented by encapsulation with h-BN layers. On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning photoemission microscopy data, we determined that this degradation was caused by the photoinduced oxidation of TMDs. These results can be used to develop a general strategy for improving the stability of 2D materials in practical applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Seongjoon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Gwangwoo", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Pramoda K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Seong In", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Hyunseob", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beamline Division, Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, POSTECH , Pohang 790-784, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Hyun-Joon", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Hyeon Suk", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27563804", "10.1021/acsnano.6b05042"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
