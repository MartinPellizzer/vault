Light alkane as one of the typical VOCs is difficult to degrade to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O by catalytic degradation method due to its strong C-H bond. Herein, a series of ultrafine Ru nanoclusters (<0.95\u00a0nm) enveloped in silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite catalysts were designed and prepared by a simple one-pot method and applied for catalytic degradation of propane. The results demonstrate that the enveloped Ru<sub>1</sub>@S-1 catalyst has excellent propane degradation performance. Its T<sub>95</sub> is as low as 294\u00a0\u00b0C with moisture, and the turnover frequency (TOF) value is up to 5.07 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, evidently higher than that of the comparison supported catalyst (Ru<sub>1</sub>/S-1). Importantly, Ru<sub>1</sub>@S-1 exhibits superior thermal stability, water resistance and recyclability, which should be attributed to the confinement and shielding effect of the S-1 shell. The in-situ DRIFTS result reveals that the propane degradation over Ru<sub>1</sub>@S-1 follows the Mars-van-Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, where the hydroxy from the framework of zeolite can provide the active oxygen species. Our work provides a new candidate and guideline for an efficient and stable catalyst for the low-temperature degradation of the light alkane VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
