This article reviews the biologic basis of children's unique vulnerability to highly prevalent outdoor air pollutants, with a special focus on ozone, respirable particulate matter (PM 2.5 [<2.5 microm in diameter] and PM 10 [<10 microm in diameter]), lead, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. We also summarize understanding regarding health effects and molecular mechanisms of action. Practitioners can significantly reduce morbidity in children and other vulnerable populations by advising families to minimize pollutant exposures to children with asthma, or at a broader level by educating policymakers about the need to act to reduce pollutant emissions. Management of children with asthma must expand beyond preventing exposures to agents that directly cause allergic reactions (and therefore can be diagnosed by means of skin tests) and must focus more attention on agents that cause a broad spectrum of nonspecific, generalized inflammation, such as air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, Center for Children's Health and the Environment, New York, NY, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trasande", "ForeName": "Leonardo", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thurston", "ForeName": "George D", "Initials": "GD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES 00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P42 ES 07384", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}], "NumberOfReferences": "101"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15805986", "10.1016/j.jaci.2005.01.056", "S0091674905003064"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
