All aqueous media were exposed to ozone at 25 degrees C with or without added chelator, 1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and spintrap, 100 mM 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide (DMPO). Exposure of distilled water to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 ppm ozone for 1 h yielded four-line spectra, 1:2:2:1, consistent with hydroxyl radical adduct formation (DMPO-OH), the amplitudes of which increased with the ozone concentration. No signals were obtained from air-exposed samples. Similar four-line spectra were also produced following interaction of 3 ppm ozone with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) alone or containing BAL fractions. Addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the incubation medium strongly inhibited formation of DMPO-OH adduct during ozone exposure. As an alternate method of demonstrating the generation of hydroxyl radicals, aqueous solutions of 1 mM L-phenylalanine were exposed to high concentrations of ozone and shown, using ion-exchange chromatography, to contain small amounts of L-tyrosine. Production of hydroxyl radicals upon interaction of ozone and water was further substantiated using the spintrap PBN (phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone) in the presence of DMSO which reacts with the hydroxyl radical resulting in the formation of methyl radical. The methyl radical subsequently reacts with spintrap PBN, yielding PBN-methyl adduct. In the absence of DMSO there was no detectable formation of methyl radical adduct. EPR double distilled water containing DMPO showed a small amount of DMPO-OH adduct upon exposure to ozone. Addition of 10 microM ferrous sulfate to this mixture produced a 10-fold increase of the signal, which was attenuated in the presence of 1500 U catalase, strongly attenuated with 50-500 microM deferoxamine or 8000 U catalase and abolished by higher concentration of deferoxamine (1 mM). The signal was not influenced by 1000 U superoxide dismutase. These results indicate that hydroxyl radicals are produced via iron-dependent reactions during the initial interaction of ozone with aqueous media, including bronchoalveolar fluid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Byvoet", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balis", "ForeName": "J U", "Initials": "JU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shelley", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montgomery", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barber", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AG07801", "Acronym": "AG", "Agency": "NIA NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "GM32696", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL34793", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7786029", "10.1006/abbi.1995.1318", "S0003-9861(85)71318-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
