Whilst distinct differences could be established between and within clones depending on soil types and genotype, only few pollutant-related effects were observed. Leaching losses from foliage were generally low compared to field studies. The data obtained with young trees in an artificial environment do not support the hypothesis that enhanced leaching from foliage may contribute to nutrient deficiencies in mature stands of Norway spruce."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Biochemische Pflanzenpathologie, Expositionskammern, GSF Munich, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstrasse 1, D-8042 Neuherberg, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfirrmann", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Runkel", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schramel", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eisenmann", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092282", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90048-h", "0269-7491(90)90048-H"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
