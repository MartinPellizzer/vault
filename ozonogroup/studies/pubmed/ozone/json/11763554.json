Analyzing the outcomes of treatment in these patients versus 59 matched patients indicated that local ozone therapy accelerated sanitation and stimulation of reparative processes in this disease on the average by a fortnight. Local ozone therapy used in the preoperative preparation of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and pleural empyema reduced the number of purulent postoperative complication to 17.7% versus 30.4% in the controls, enhanced the efficiency of multimodality treatment by 15.6% and reduced mortality by 9.5%. Analyzing the results of prevention of purulent bronchopleural complications after pleuropulmonectomy in 31 patients in the experimental group and in 35 in the control one showed that with local ozone therapy, complications occurred in 16.1 and 28.6%, respectively, and the efficiency of surgical management increased by 13.1% and mortality rates reduced by 9.6%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobkin", "ForeName": "V G", "Initials": "VG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadovnikova", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuz'min", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bondarev", "ForeName": "G B", "Initials": "GB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Mestnaia ozonoterapiia v kompleksnom khirgicheskom lechenii bol'nykh tuberkulezom legkikh i plevry."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Probl Tuberk", "NlmUniqueID": "0414141", "ISSNLinking": "0032-9533"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Empyema, Tuberculous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11763554"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
