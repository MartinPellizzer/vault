Experimental results showed that, without O<sub>3</sub> addition, the oxidation of DEC began from 650 K with no low-temperature reactivity, while with O<sub>3</sub> addition the low-temperature chemistry of DEC was observed from 450 K. A DEC/O<sub>3</sub> kinetic model was developed, and the model predictions agreed with the experimental data reasonably well with a slight overprediction of DEC oxidation between 550 and 750 K. The low-temperature chemistry of DEC with O<sub>3</sub> addition was described in the reaction pathway of DEC. It was found that O<sub>3</sub> assisted the low-temperature oxidation of DEC mainly through the production of the active O: atom instead of the direct reaction with the fuel molecule. The present work indicated that the Li-ion battery degradation at 400-500 K might result from the low-temperature chemistry of DEC with active oxygen supplies from the cathode metal oxide materials or from singlet O<sub>2</sub> during the battery discharge process. This article used O<sub>3</sub> to mimic the oxidizing environment in the Li-ion battery by providing active atomic oxygen. It provided insights into the chemically sensitized gas-phase low-temperature chemistry of DEC and explained the mechanism of battery degradation involving the low-temperature oxidation at the electrolyte solvent and the cathode interface from 400 to 500 K."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8879-9595"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-5263, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic UniversityHung Hom, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-5263, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shixiang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2415-6080"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-5263, United States."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Technical Thermodynamics, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen 52062, Germany."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Can", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7748-5999"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-5263, United States."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yongfeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9730-8487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-5263, United States."}], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Yiguang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33525870", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c09002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
