Conventional water treatment processes poorly remove AOM that can transform to harmful disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during ensuing disinfection. This article offers a comprehensive review on the impacts of pre-oxidation on the formation of DBPs from AOM in subsequent chlor(am)ination. Various characterization techniques for algal cells and AOM are first overviewed with an effort to better understanding of correlation between the AOM properties and downstream DBP formation. Then, the present work reviews recent studies on application of different pre-oxidation technologies, such as chlor(am) ination, UV irradiation, ozonation, ferrate (VI), permanganate oxidation and UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), to remove algal cells and degrade AOM. Pre-oxidation can reduce the stability of algal cells and inactivate algal cells for promoting cell aggregation and thus favoring coagulation. Meanwhile, pre-oxidation can mitigate and degrade AOM into small molecular weight organic compounds to reduce DBP formation potential during subsequent chlor(am)ination. Finally, this review provides an overall evaluation on the applicability of different pre-oxidation processes, and identifies future research demands."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
