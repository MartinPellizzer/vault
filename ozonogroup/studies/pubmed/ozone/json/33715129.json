In this study, performance of combined coagulation/decantation-ozone/hydrogen peroxide (O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-biological aerated filter (BAF) technology used to further treat BLCHMR was investigated with pilot-scale experiment. Under optimal conditions, the COD (40-44 mg/L) and color (13-17 time) in treated BLCHMR indicated that combined process can efficiently treat BLCHMR. O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> had good performance not only in mineralization and decomposing of organic matter but also in decolorization of BLCHMR. For dissolved organic matter (DOM), O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reacted with non-biodegradable fraction preferentially and oxidized different molecular weight (MW) fractions equally. O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-BAF generated more higher MW DOM (namely F2 fraction) than BAF alone. Meanwhile, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mainly influenced the amount and biodegradability on DOM but not the removal rate on DOM. Accordingly, the helpful influence on O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> perhaps can be owed to the generalized influence on DOM but not the specific influence on improved biodegradability. Finally, inspiring (namely very low) cost (respectively, 0.3419 $/per ton bio-treated leachate and 0.5766 $/Kg COD removed) was achieved in the combined process."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
