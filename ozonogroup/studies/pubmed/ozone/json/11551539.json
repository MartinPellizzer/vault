Recently, however, there have been a renewal of interest, and the heterogeneous visible light-induced degradative reactions of lipidic compounds associated with phytodetritus have been studied. The present paper reviews the results obtained in the course of these studies. In the first part, the production and quenching of excited states of chlorophyll and toxic oxygen species (singlet oxygen, superoxide ion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide) in healthy and senescent phytoplanktonic cells are discussed. Then, the photo-oxidation of the main lipidic cell components (chlorophyll, chlorophyll phytyl chain, carotenoids, sterols, unsaturated fatty acids, alkenones and unsaturated alkenes) in senescent phytoplanktonic cells is examined. Emphasis is given to the degradation rates and the mechanisms of visible light-induced degradation of the main lipidic components of phytoplankton and to the structure of the photoproducts formed. In each case, the selectivity of these compounds is discussed in order to select a \"pool\" of photoproducts able to act as tracers of photo-oxidative alterations in the marine medium. This \"pool\" of photoproducts could provide very useful information concerning the physiological state of phytoplanktonic communities and current environmental problems related to ozone depletion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'Oc\u00e9anographie et de Biog\u00e9ochimie (UMR 6535), Centre d'Oc\u00e9anologie de Marseille (OSU), campus de Luminy case 901, 13288, Marseille, France. rontani@com.univ-mrs.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rontani", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytoplankton"}], "NumberOfReferences": "66"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11551539", "10.1016/s0031-9422(01)00202-3", "S0031-9422(01)00202-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
