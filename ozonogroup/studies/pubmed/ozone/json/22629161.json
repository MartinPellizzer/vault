The experiment simulated a 20% stratospheric ozone depletion over Portugal. At silking, UV-B increased N, K, Ca, and Zn concentrations, whereas at maturity Ca, Mg, Zn, and Cu increased and N, P and Mn decreased in some plant organs. Generally, at maturity, N, Ca, Cu, and Mn were lower, while P, K, and Zn concentrations in stems and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) were higher in N-starved plants. UV-B and N effects on shoot dry biomass were more pronounced than on nutrient concentrations. Nutrient uptake decreased under high UV-B and increased with increasing N application, mainly at maturity harvest. Significant interactions UV-B x N were observed for NUE and for concentration and mass of some elements. For instance, under enhanced UV-B, N, Cu, Zn, and Mn concentrations decreased in leaves, except on N-stressed plants, whereas they were less affected by N nutrition. In order to minimize nutritional, economical, and environmental negative consequences, fertiliser recommendations based on element concentration or yield goals may need to be adjusted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environment, Centre for the Research and Technology of Agro-Environment and Biological Sciences, University of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, 5001-801 Vila Real, Portugal. ccorreia@utad.pt"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Correia", "ForeName": "Carlos M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coutinho", "ForeName": "Jo\u00e3o F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bacelar", "ForeName": "Eunice A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "Berta M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bj\u00f6rn", "ForeName": "Lars Olof", "Initials": "LO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moutinho Pereira", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ScientificWorldJournal", "NlmUniqueID": "101131163", "ISSNLinking": "1537-744X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solar Energy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "World Meteorological Organization.
