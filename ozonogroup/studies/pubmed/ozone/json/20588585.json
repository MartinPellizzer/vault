The treatment drastically transforms the role of NaF film from hole-blocking to hole-injecting. This transformation is elucidated using hole-only devices, energy band measurement, surface energy, surface polarity, and X-ray photoelectron spectra. With the optimal thickness (3 nm) of the UV-ozone-treated NaF layer, the device performance is significantly improved, with a turn-on voltage, maximum luminance, and maximum current efficiency of 2.5 V, 15700 cd/m(2), and 4.9 cd/A, respectively. Results show that NaF film is not only a hole-blocking layer, but also a promising hole-injecting layer after UV-ozone treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu-Cheng", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kao", "ForeName": "Po-Ching", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Sheng-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Express", "NlmUniqueID": "101137103", "ISSNLinking": "1094-4087"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20588585", "10.1364/OE.18.00A167", "199760"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
