An atmospheric corrosion test was carried out in spring-summer 2012 at a polluted urban site, i.e., Tung Chung in western Hong Kong. Nine types of metallic materials, namely iron, Q235 steel, 20# steel, 16Mn steel, copper, bronze, brass, aluminum, and aluminum alloy, were selected as specimens for corrosion tests. Ten sets of the nine materials were all exposed to ambient air, and then each set was collected individually after exposure to ambient air for consecutive 6, 13, 20, 27, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, and 70 days, respectively. After the removal of the corrosion products on the surface of the exposed specimens, the corrosion rate of each material was determined. The surface structure of materials was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after the corrosion tests. Environmental factors including temperature, relative humidity, concentrations of gaseous pollutants, i.e., sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O\u2083), and particulate-phase pollutants, i.e., PM\u2082.\u2085 (FSP) and PM\u2081\u2080 (RSP), were monitored. Correlation analysis between environmental factors and corrosion rate of materials indicated that iron and carbon steel were damaged by both gaseous pollutants (SO\u2082 and NO\u2082) and particles. Copper and copper alloys were mainly corroded by gaseous pollutants (SO\u2082 and O\u2083), while corrosion of aluminum and aluminum alloy was mainly attributed to NO\u2082 and particles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Da-Wei", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Zhen-Hao", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cheung", "ForeName": "Kalam", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12597-69-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Steel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Corrosion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Steel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Res Rep Health Eff Inst. 2004 Sep;(121):1-35; discussion 37-46", "ArticleIdList": ["15553489"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Pollut Control Assoc. 1967 Jun;17(6):398-402", "ArticleIdList": ["6043800"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25400029", "10.1007/s10661-014-4112-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
