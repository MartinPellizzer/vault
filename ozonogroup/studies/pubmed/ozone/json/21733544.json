We present the bench scale study that was conducted to select the most appropriate oxidant. Ozone and catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (Fenton's reaction) were discarded since they were incompatible with plant activity. Permanganate, activated percarbonate and activated persulfate were tested. Batch experiments were run with groundwater and groundwater-chalk slurries with these three oxidants. Total BTEX degradation in groundwater was reached with all the oxidants. The molar ratios [oxidant]:[Fe(2+)]:[BTEX] were 100:0:1 with permanganate, 100:100:1 with persulfate and 25:100:1 with percarbonate. Precipitation of either manganese dioxide or iron carbonate (siderite) occurred. The best results with chalk slurries were obtained with permanganate at the molar ratio 110:0:1 and activated persulfate at the molar ratio 110:110:1. To avoid precipitation, persulfate was also used without activation at the molar ratio 140:1. Natural Oxidant Demand measured with both oxidants was lower than 5% of initial oxidant contents. Activated percarbonate was not appropriate because of radical scavenging by carbonated media. Permanganate and persulfate were both effective at oxidant concentrations of ca 1 g kg(-1) with permanganate and 1.8 g kg(-1) with persulfate and adapted to site conditions. Activation of persulfate was not mandatory. This bench scale study proved that ISCO remediation of a chalky aquifer contaminated by mainly xylenes was possible with permanganate and activated or unactivated persulfate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
