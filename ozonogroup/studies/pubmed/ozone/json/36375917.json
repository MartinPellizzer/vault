Under the condition of low O<sub>3</sub> concentration (O<sub>3</sub>/NO molar ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.6), F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (F-TiO<sub>2</sub>), which is cheap and environmentally friendly, has been prepared as ozonation catalysts for NO oxidation. Catalytic activity tests performed at 120\u00b0C showed that the NO oxidation efficiency of F-TiO<sub>2</sub> samples was higher than that of TiO<sub>2</sub> (about 43.7%), and the NO oxidation efficiency of F-TiO<sub>2</sub>-0.15 was the highest, which was 65.3%. Combined with physicochemical characteristics of catalysts and the analysis of active species, it was found that there was a synergistic effect between F sites and oxygen vacancies on F-TiO<sub>2</sub>, which could accelerate the transformation of monomolecular O<sub>3</sub> into multi-molecule singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), thus promoting the selective oxidation of NO to NO<sub>2</sub>. The oxidation reaction of NO on F-TiO<sub>2</sub>-0.15 follows the Eley-Rideal mechanism, that is, gaseous NO reacts with adsorbed O<sub>3</sub> and finally form NO<sub>2</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
