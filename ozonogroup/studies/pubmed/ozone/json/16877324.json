One such approach is the unifying theory proposed by Reich (1987), which combines the O(3) response of contrasting physiognomic classes of plants on the basis of their intrinsic leaf diffusive conductance and, hence, capacity for O(3) uptake. Physiognomic classes differ in the proportional decline in photosynthesis and growth when compared on the basis of cumulative O(3) exposure per unit time, but converge when compared on the basis of O(3) uptake per unit time or cumulative O(3) uptake over the entire lifetime of the leaf. The theory is based on observations on a large number of contrasting plant species, relying primarily on studies of juvenile trees subjected to short-term O(3) exposure. To test the applicability of the unifying theory to mature trees, broadleaf deciduous European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and the evergreen conifer Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in a mature mixed stand were exposed to either ambient air (control) or air with twice the ambient O(3) concentration delivered into the canopy by means of a free-air fumigation system. We accounted for differences in growing season length, leaf longevity and O(3)-related effects on leaf diffusive conductance in determining total O(3) uptake over the lifetime of the leaf. On this basis, Norway spruce needles required 5 years to take up as much O(3) as did beech leaves in one growing season. The core of the unifying theory on O(3) sensitivity was substantiated in relation to O(3) exposure and uptake. However, contrary to the unifying theory, which was formulated on the basis of results with juvenile trees, the O(3) response of mature trees in a natural stand was more complex. The increased complexity was attributed to additional environmental stressors, stress compensation at the whole-tree level, and differential O(3) sensitivities of leaves according to age class and position within the canopy. Contrary to the theory, photosynthesis was no less sensitive to O(3) in Norway spruce than that of beech, and was reduced in the twice-ambient O(3) regime in the first year of exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecophysiology of Plants, TU M\u00fcnchen, Am Hochanger 13, D-85354 Freising, Germany. nunn@wzw.tum.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nunn", "ForeName": "Angela J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weiser", "ForeName": "Gerhard", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reiter", "ForeName": "Ilja M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00e4berle", "ForeName": "Karl-Heinz", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grote", "ForeName": "R\u00fcdiger", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Havranek", "ForeName": "Wilhelm M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "Rainer", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Picea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solar System"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16877324", "10.1093/treephys/26.11.1391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
