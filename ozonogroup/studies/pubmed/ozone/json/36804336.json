A novel cathode membrane integrated electro-hybrid ozonation-coagulation (CM-E-HOC) process was proposed for the treatment of polymer-flooding produced water. This process achieved in situ self-cleaning by generated microbubbles in the cathode membrane. The CM-E-HOC process achieved a higher suspended solid (SS), turbidity and PAM removal efficiency than the CM-EC process. The SS in the CM-E-HOC effluent was \u2264 20\u00a0mg/L SS, which met the reinjection requirements of Longdong, Changqing Oilfield, China (Q/SYCQ 08,011-2019) at different current densities (3, 5 and 10\u00a0mA/cm<sup>2</sup>). The CM-E-HOC process greatly mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling. Therefore, excellent flux recovery was obtained at different in situ self-cleaning intervals during the CM-E-HOC process. Furthermore, alternating filtration achieved continuous water production during the CM-E-HOC process. On one hand, the effective removal of aromatic protein-like substances and an increase in oxygen-containing functional groups were achieved due to the enhanced oxidation ability of the CM-E-HOC process, which decreased membrane fouling. On the other hand, the CM-E-HOC process showed improved coagulation performance because of the increased oxygen-containing functional groups and polymeric Fe species. Therefore, larger flocs with higher fractal dimensions were generated, and a looser and more porous cake layer was formed on the membrane surface during the CM-E-HOC process. Consequently, the CM-E-HOC process exhibited better in situ self-cleaning performance and lower filtration resistance than the CM-EC process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
