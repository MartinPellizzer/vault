We used wavelet analysis, the entropy weight method, and correlation analysis to discuss O<sub>3</sub> and its influencing factors and researched the potential sources of O<sub>3</sub> in Shandong Peninsula. The results showed that:\u2460 in terms of the time pattern, the near-surface O<sub>3</sub> in Shandong Peninsula showed a \"triple peak\" trend from 2005 to 2020, reaching the maximum value of[(40.48\u00b17.64) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>] in 2010 and a minimum value of[(36.63\u00b15.61) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>] in 2013. The season was expressed as:summer[(42.49\u00b11.7) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>]>spring[(40.65\u00b10.6) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>]>autumn[(36.47\u00b10.7) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>]>winter[(36.46\u00b10.3) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>]. \u2461 In terms of the spatial pattern, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration of Shandong Peninsula gradually increased with the increase in latitude from 2005 to 2020, showing the characteristics of high concentrations in the east and west and low in the middle region. During the 16-year evolution of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration, there was a 1.5 a main oscillation period. \u2462The analysis of meteorological conditions revealed that O<sub>3</sub> concentration was positively correlated with temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and sunshine hours, whereas pressure and wind speed were negatively correlated. In the analysis of social factors, soot (dust) emissions were the most obvious factor affecting the third indicator, with a weight of 0.25. \u2463 Through simulating the trajectory of airflow from different regions (Ji'nan and Qingdao), it was found that the ocean airflow contributed 10.69% to Jinan and 48.94% to Qingdao. There was 64.04% of the long-distance air mass transmission path coming from the northwest, and 43.69% of the short-distance air mass transmission path was from the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, followed by Shandong Province with 21.01%. \u2464 The analysis of potential sources of O<sub>3</sub> showed that the potential sources of Ji'nan were mainly distributed in Jinzhou, Liaoning Province, northern Jiangsu Province, Hubei Province, and Anhui Province, with a WPSCF value >0.6, and Qingdao's WPSCF value of >0.6 was mainly distributed in the Yellow Sea area. The O<sub>3</sub> contribution of Jining City, Linyi City, Xuzhou City, Huaibei City, and Lianyungang City was >40 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The area with >45 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in Qingdao was mainly in the Yellow Sea. Through the analysis of potential sources in the Shandong Peninsula, particular attention should be paid to the supply of industrial sources in the surrounding areas and the marine sources provided by marine air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Le", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Min-Xia", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Shi-Rui", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Si-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Jia-le", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attention"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35258189", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202107003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
