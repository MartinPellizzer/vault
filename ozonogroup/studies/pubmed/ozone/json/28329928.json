A total of 5 388 myocardial infarction deaths occurred, with a daily average of 3 deaths. In single-pollutant model, an increase of 0.1 mg/m(3) in average concentration of CO could increase the risk of myocardial infarction mortality by 1.06% (95<i>% CI</i>: 0.29%-1.93%) in general population, and by 1.26% (95<i>% CI</i>:0.28%-2.24%) in aged people aged \u226565 years in lagged 6 days, but the influence was not significant in people aged <65 years. The influence had no significant difference in males, but it increased the risk of myocardial infarction mortality by 1.77% in females (95<i>% CI</i>: 0.44%-3.13%). In multi-pollutant model, CO did remain robust after adjusting for other co-pollutants. Whereas the effect of O(3) had no significant influence. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggested that the increased risk of daily myocardial infarction mortality was associated with the increase of CO concentration, but no such association was found for O(3) in Ningbo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "X J", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "G X", "Initials": "GX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningbo Prefecture Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo 315010, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningbo Prefecture Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo 315010, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningbo Prefecture Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo 315010, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "G Z", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "X B", "Initials": "XB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8208604", "ISSNLinking": "0254-6450"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Surveillance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28329928", "10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2017.03.005"]}}]}
