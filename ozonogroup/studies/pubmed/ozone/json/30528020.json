The selectivity of ozonation towards different constituents and functional groups was analysed using two-dimensional correlation spectra (2D-COS) probed by FT-IR, synchronous fluorescence spectra and HPSEC. The results indicated that ozonation can destroy aromatic structures of EfOM and change its molecular weight distribution (MWD). According to 2D-COS analysis, microbial humic-like substances were preferentially removed, and then the protein-like fractions. Terrestrial humic-like components exhibited inactivity towards ozonation compared with the above two fractions. Protein-like substances with small molecular weight were preferentially reacted during ozonation based on 2D-COS probed by HPSEC. In addition, the selectivity of ozone towards different functional groups of EfOM exhibited the following sequence: phenolic and alcoholic CO groups\u202f>\u202faromatic structures containing CC double bonds\u202f>\u202faliphatic CH. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further elucidated the preferential reaction of aromatic structures in EfOM during ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
