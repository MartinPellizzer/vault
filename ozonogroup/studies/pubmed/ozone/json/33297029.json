The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of combined microbubble-catalytic ozonation process (M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC) for improving the ozonation efficiency during treatment of petrochemical wastewater (PCW). M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC process optimization was carried out with different pH conditions, ozone dosages and catalyst loadings. The optimum operating conditions were identified as 50\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> ozone dosage, real PCW pH (7.0-7.5) and 4\u00a0g\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> catalyst loading. Among different ozonation processes, M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC process achieved the highest chemical oxidation demand (COD) removal efficiency of 88%, which is 18% and 43% higher than those achieved by the microbubble and macrobubble ozonation processes, respectively. Phenolic compounds presented in PCW could be reduced by 63% within 15\u00a0min in M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC treatment process. Long-term continuous flow studies suggested M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC process to be the most cost-effective technology for PCW treatment with an operating cost of S$0.18\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> COD and S$0.4\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> with good catalyst stability. Liquid size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) data suggested humic substances to be the dominant organic species in PCW, M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC could achieve significant humic substances removal and biodegradability enhancement in PCW. Kinetics and mechanism studies revealed that organics removal in M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC was 1.8 times higher than that in microbubble ozonation process, and hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u25cf</sup>OH) was the dominant oxidant specie for organics removal in M-O<sub>3</sub>/Fe/GAC process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
