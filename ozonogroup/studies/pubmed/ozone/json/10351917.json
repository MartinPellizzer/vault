The question remains of whether there are susceptible subpopulations of asthmatic individuals who are particularly vulnerable to high O3 levels. Because tobacco use was prevalent in our cohort of inner-city adult asthmatic individuals (n = 1,216) in New York City (NYC), we investigated whether cigarette smoking was an effect modifier for asthma morbidity. We examined the relationship between personal tobacco use and O3-associated emergency department (ED) use for asthma in public hospitals in NYC. Three subpopulations were defined: never smokers (0 pack-yr), heavy smokers (>/= 13 pack-yr) and light smokers (< 13 pack-yr). Time-series regression analysis of ED use for asthma and daily O3 levels was done while controlling for temperature, seasonal/long-term trends, and day-of-week effects. Heavy smokers displayed an increased relative risk (RR) of ED visits for asthma in response to increases in 2-d lagged O3 levels (RR per 50 ppb O3 = 1.72; 95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 2.62). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that heavy cigarette use was a predictor of ED use for asthma following days with high O3 levels. Although adverse health effects of ambient O3 have also been documented in asthma populations not using cigarettes (e.g., children), our results suggest that in adult asthmatic individuals, heavy personal tobacco use may be an effect modifier for O3-associated morbidity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cassino", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bader", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ciotoli", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thurston", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reibman", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "KO7 HL03050", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "M01 RR00096", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Medical Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York City"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10351917", "10.1164/ajrccm.159.6.9809042"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
