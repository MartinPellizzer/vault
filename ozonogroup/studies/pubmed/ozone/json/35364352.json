Such a challenge is the control of filamentous bulking caused by the overgrowth of certain filamentous bacteria. In this study, we tested different mitigation strategies to reduce filamentous bulking, caused by two common filamentous genera found in full-scale water resource recovery facilities (WRRF), Candidatus Microthrix and Candidatus Amarolinea. PAX dosing, ozone addition, hydrocyclone implementation, and the addition of nano-coagulants were tested as mitigation strategies in four parallel treatment lines in a full-scale WRRF over three consecutive years. Unexpectedly, the activated sludge settleability was not affected by any of the mitigation strategies. Some of the strategies appeared to have a strong mitigating effect on the two filamentous species. However, detailed analyses of the microbial communities revealed strong recurrent seasonal variations in all four lines, including the control line which masked the real effect. After removing the effect of the seasonal variation by using a time-series decomposition approach, it was clear that the filamentous bacteria were mostly unaffected by the mitigation strategies. Only PAX dosing had some effect on Ca. Microthrix, but only on one species, Ca. Microthrix subdominans, and not on the most common Ca. Microthrix parvicella. Overall, our study shows the importance of long-term monitoring of microbial communities at species level to understand the normal seasonal pattern to effectively plan and execute full-scale experiments. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of using parallel reference treatment lines when evaluating the effect of mitigation strategies in full-scale treatment plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
