The results indicated that the lowest capillary suction time (CST) of 20.9\u00a0s and water content of dewatered sludge cake (Wc) of 64.09% were achieved under the dosage of 40\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/g dry solids (DS) and 0.4\u00a0g SBC-FeCe/g DS which were considered as the optimum condition. In view of excellent electron exchanging capacity of SBC-FeCe with rich Lewis acid sites and conversions of valence sates of Fe and Ce, more O<sub>3</sub> were decomposed into reactive oxygen species under the catalytic action of SBC-FeCe, which strengthened oxidizing capacity. Enhanced oxidation rendered sludge cells inactivation and compact network structure rupture releasing intracellular water and organic substances. Subsequently, hydrophilic organic matters were attacked and eliminated lessening sludge viscosity and colloidal forces and intensifying hydrophobicity and flowability. In addition, changes of sludge morphology suggested that sludge roughness was alleviated, structural strength and compressibility were raised and porous and retiform structure was constructed providing channels for water outflow by adding skeleton builder of SBC-FeCe. Overall, the synergistic interaction of strengthened oxidation and skeleton construction improved sludge dewaterability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
