The trihalomethane forming potential (THMFP) and toxicity of treated solutions were also evaluated. The experimental conditions were ozone of 21 mg min(-1), H(2)O(2) of 8 \u00d7 10(-4)M, Fe(0) of 20 g L(-1), air flow of 5 L min(-1), and UVC of 9 W. Results indicated that Fe(0)/air rapidly removed HA color (>99%) and COD (90%) within 9 min. 51-81% of color and 43-50% of COD were removed by ozonation and Fenton oxidation after 60 min. Both UV enhanced ozone and Fenton oxidation removed HA, but the Fe(0)/air process did not. Spectrum results showed all processes effectively diminished UV-vis spectra, except for ozonation. The THMFP of Fe(0)/air-treated solution (114 \u03bcg L(-1)) was much lower than those of Fenton- (226 \u03bcg L(-1)) and ozonation-treated solutions (499 \u03bcg L(-1)). Fe(0)/air with UV irradiation obviously increased the THMFP of treated solution (502 \u03bcg L(-1)). The toxicity results obtained from Vibrio fischeri light inhibition test indicated that the toxicity of Fe(0)/air-treated solution (5%) was much lower than that of ozonation- (33%) and Fenton-treated solutions (31%). Chlorination increased the solution toxicity. The correlation between biotoxicity and chloroform in the chlorinated solution was insignificant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
