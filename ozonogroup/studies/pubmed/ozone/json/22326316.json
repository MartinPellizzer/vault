In addition, the antibacterial activity of the solution treated by UV/H(2)O(2) advanced oxidation was compared with AM solution treated with ozone. The degradation rate of amoxicillin in both processes fitted pseudo first-order kinetics, and the rates increased up to six fold with increasing H(2)O(2) addition at 10mM H(2)O(2) compared to direct photolysis. However, low mineralization was achieved in both processes, showing a maximum of 50% TOC removal with UV/H(2)O(2) after a reaction time of 80min (UV dose: 3.8\u00d710(-3)EinsteinL(-1)) with the addition of 10mM H(2)O(2). The transformation products formed during the degradation of amoxicillin in the UV and UV/H(2)O(2) processes were identified by LC-IT-TOF analysis. In addition, microbial growth inhibition bioassays were performed to determine any residual antibacterial activity from potential photoproducts remaining in the treated solutions. An increase of the antibacterial activity in the UV/H(2)O(2) treated samples was observed compared to the untreated sample in a time-based comparison. However, the UV/H(2)O(2) process effectively eliminated any antibacterial activity from AM and its intermediate photoproducts at 20min of contact time with a 10mM H(2)O(2) dose after the complete elimination of AM, even though the UV/H(2)O(2) advanced oxidation process led to bioactive photoproducts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
