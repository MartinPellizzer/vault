The Phytotoxic Ozone Dose with an hourly threshold of uptake (Y), to represent the detoxification capacity of trees (POD1 in mmol m<sup>-2</sup> per leaf area, with Y\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0nmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>), and the number of exceedances of the O<sub>3</sub> critical level of 5.2\u00a0mmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> per leaf area for European beech and 9.2\u00a0mmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> per leaf area for Norway spruce were calculated by using the DO<sub>3</sub>SE model. A Principal Component Analysis revealed strong correlations between daily O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, daytime O<sub>3</sub> (for hours with global radiation exceeding 50\u00a0W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>), POD1, global radiation, vapor pressure deficit and air temperature. Moreover, a significant correlation was obtained between POD1 and soil water content (SWC) at all sites (r\u00a0=\u00a00.51-0.74). The Random Forests Analysis confirmed that the SWC is the most important predictor of stomatal O<sub>3</sub> fluxes. The soil water supply is very important for POD1 estimation, because drought decreases stomatal conductance, leading to a reduction of transpiration, as well as to lower O<sub>3</sub> uptake through stomata. Between 1998 and 2019, the drier and warmer climate induced a soil drought (on average, SWC - 0.15\u00a0% per year) leading to lower stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake by forests (- 0.36\u00a0mmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> per year). Hence, during growing seasons with sufficient water supply and often lower O<sub>3</sub> levels compared to hot and dry periods, forests are at higher O<sub>3</sub> risk than during hot and dry periods when the drought stress is more significant than O<sub>3</sub> stress despite relatively higher O<sub>3</sub> levels. Irrespective of these differences in O<sub>3</sub> uptake between relatively cool and humid as compared to relatively hot and dry years in the study region, the Critical Level for O<sub>3</sub> was exceeded in late spring/early summer (May/June) during all 22 years. Risk assessment for the protection of European forests, which is urgently needed due to the forests current critical state after several successive years of drought and exceedance of the O<sub>3</sub> critical level in large areas of Europe, should therefore become flux-based to account for the inter-twined effects of drought and O<sub>3</sub> on the physiology and health of forest trees in the region. For stomatal O<sub>3</sub> fluxes estimation, a better soil water and leaf parameterization is needed e.g., by taking into account both O<sub>3</sub>- and drought-induced effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
