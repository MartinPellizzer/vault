The spread of this epidemic started in the US in late March 2020 and became a major issue in April due to an outburst of COVID-19 cases. Most of the countries in the world imposed complete to partial lockdown, but in the US, few states imposed lockdowns. Even after the advisory of the various Government department, the mobility data suggest that there was an enhancement (10-15%) in mobility during March 2020. Later sudden drop in mobility was observed during April 2020. The fall in aerosols optical depth (AOD), particulate matter concentration, NO<sub>2,</sub> and Ozone are observed along with the positive shifts in the SO<sub>2</sub>. In some of the states, AOD shows pronounced decline during May and June (5-40.90%), in the month of\u00a0 May more than 80% decline was observed compared to the month of June 2020. In the month of April 2020, up to 73.64% decline was observed in NO<sub>2,</sub> and 70-99% in the months of May and June 2020. We found a good relationship between the mobility data and improvement in the air quality of the US. The changes were not significant compared to other countries in the world due to scattered lockdown policy, but in the US a pronounced change is observed during April month compared to March and May."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cosumnes Oak High School, 8350 Lotz Parkway, Elk Grove, CA 95757 USA."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Ritvik", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.37589.30", "0000 0004 0532 3167"], "Affiliation": "Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research, National Central University, Taoyuan, 32001 Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chauhan", "ForeName": "Akshansha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6649-7767"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.254024.5", "0000 0000 9006 1798"], "Affiliation": "School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA-92866 USA."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Ramesh P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trinity Technology Group, Suite 105, 2015 J Street, Sacramento, CA 95757 USA."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "N C", "Initials": "NC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Gas & Electric, 3136 Boeing Way, Stockton, CA 95204 USA."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Rozalin", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Model Earth Syst Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "101675633"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Acharya P, Barik G, Gayen BK, Bar S, Maiti A, Sarkar A, Ghosh S, De SK, Sreekesh S.
