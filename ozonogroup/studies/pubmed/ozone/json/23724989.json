This work investigated the contribution to gas-phase SOA formation of ozone reactions with surface-sorbed D-limonene, which is common indoors. A model framework was developed to predict SOA mass formation because of ozone/terpenoid surface reactions, and it was used with steady state experiments in a 283 L chamber to determine the aerosol mass fraction of SOA resulting from surface reactions, \u03bes (the ratio of mass of SOA formed and mass of ozone consumed by ozone/terpenoid surface reactions), for ozone/D-limonene reactions on stainless steel. The \u03bes = 0.70-0.91, with lower relative humidity leading to both higher mass and number formation. Also, surface reactions promoted nucleation more than gas-phase reactions, and number formation due to surface reactions and gas-phase reactions were 126-339 and 51.1-60.2 no./cm(3) per \u03bcg/m(3) of formed SOA, respectively. We also used the model framework to predict that indoor spaces in which ozone/D-limonene surface reactions would likely lead to meaningful gas-phase SOA formation are those with surfaces that have low original reactivity with ozone, such as glass, sealed materials, or smooth metals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, Drexel University, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States. msw59@drexel.edu"}], "LastName": "Waring", "ForeName": "Michael S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Siegel", "ForeName": "Jeffrey A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23724989", "10.1021/es400846d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
