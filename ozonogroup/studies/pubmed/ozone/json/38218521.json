Currently, the relationship of increasing global skin cancer rates with increased ultraviolet radiations (UVRs) resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion, global warming, and air pollution from fossil-fuel combustion.", "We conducted a retrospective epidemiological study including 546 NMSC patients managed at the Dermatology Unit of the Tor Vergata Hospital to highlight different trends of sun exposure or different comorbidities.", "Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to evidence differences between continous variable and Spearman rank test for dicotomical variables. Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated to obtain the 10-years survival rate in order to identify the mean comorbidity burden of our patients.", "Considering patients with comorbidities (73.81%), actinic keratoses (AKs) was the most frequent lesion. In patients with a history of previous melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) was predominant (ANOVA test, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with a statistically significant correlation (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.453; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) showed a higher rate in arterial hypertension patients, followed by the chronic heart failure and hematologic neoplasms (60%, 29.7% and 32.1%, respectively) groups. Men were more affected than women, representing 61.54% of patients. Chronic sun exposure is directly correlated with SCC rho\u00a0=\u00a00.561; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas BCC correlated with a history of sunburns (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.312; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "History of photo-exposition had an important role on NMSC development especially for work or recreational reasons. Sex, age, and presence of comorbidities influenced different NMSC types. BCC was more frequent in younger patients, associated with melanoma and sunburns. The presence of SCC is associated with older patients and the hypertension group. AKs were diagnosed predominantly in oldest men, with a chronic sun-exposure history, and hematologic neoplasms group."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
