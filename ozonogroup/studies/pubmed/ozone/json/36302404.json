The UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization process was designed and applied at the pilot-scale for treatment of actual high-salt textile wastewater. The UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization process achieved the highest decolorization (85 %) and chemical oxygen demand (COD<sub>Cr</sub>, 43.2 %) removal efficiency at an O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 200 g\u00b7t<sup>-1</sup> and a pressure of 0.2 MPa. Compared to ordinary ozonation, the UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization process improved the solubility and gas-liquid mass transfer efficiency of O<sub>3</sub> in wastewater and generated a large number of O<sub>3</sub> microbubbles. Hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH), superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup>) and single oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) all played a significant role on the removal of pollutants in wastewater during the UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization process. The reverse osmosis (RO) process was used to evaluate the effect of UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization and Fenton pre-oxidation processes on the desalination process as the last process in treating high-salt organic wastewater. The pre-oxidation processes improved the initial RO water flux. Compared with the Fenton process, the UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization process had less membrane fouling (thin fouling layer vs thick fouling layer), and final water flux (59.4 LMH) was higher than that of Fenton process (34.9 LHM). The total dissolved solids (TDS), Cl<sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> of the effluent from UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization process (37.2, 7.6 and 3.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>) were better than that of Fenton process (65.7, 13.9 and 7.1 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>). Therefore, the UV/O<sub>3</sub> pressurization process without secondary pollution is more suitable for the advanced treatment of high-salt organic wastewater than the Fenton process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
