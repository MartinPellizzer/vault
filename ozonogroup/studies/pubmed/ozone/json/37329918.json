During their atmospheric lifetime, these gases and particles are subjected to oxidation, leading to the formation of secondary pollutants. We examined the oxidation of incense burning plumes under O<sub>3</sub> exposure and dark condition using an oxidation flow reactor connected to a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). Nitrate formation was observed in incense burning particles, mainly attributable to the ozonolysis of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. With UV on, nitrate formation was significantly enhanced, likely due to HNO<sub>3</sub>/HNO<sub>2</sub>/NOx uptake triggered by OH chemistry, which is more effective than ozone oxidation. The extent of nitrate formation is insensitive to O<sub>3</sub> and OH exposure, possibly due to the diffusion limitation on interfacial uptake. The O<sub>3</sub>-UV-aged particles are more oxygenated and functionalized than O<sub>3</sub>-Dark-aged particles. Oxalate and malonate, two typical secondary organic aerosol (SOA) components, were found in O<sub>3</sub>-UV-aged particles. Our work reveals that nitrate, accompanied by SOA, can rapidly form in incense-burning particles upon photochemical oxidation in the atmosphere, which could deepen our understanding of air pollution caused by religious activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
