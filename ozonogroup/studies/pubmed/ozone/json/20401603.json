An inland city was chosen as a comparison site. The main results and conclusions of this study are: (1) ozone pollution, with a maximum 1 h concentration of 150.98 ppbv, was severe during summer and autumn at the coastal site; (2) the ozone level was obviously higher at the coastal site than that at the inland site in September; (3) besides temperature and solar radiation, sea-land breeze circulation is an important factor influencing the ozone level at the coastal site, and sea breeze often induce high ozone levels (the average ozone concentration for sea breeze was about 13 ppbv higher than that for land breeze)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shandong University, 250100 Jinan, People's Republic of China. yqyin@sdu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yongquan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Wenpo", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Xingyan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Jian'an", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Laimin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oceans and Seas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20401603", "10.1007/s00128-010-9977-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
