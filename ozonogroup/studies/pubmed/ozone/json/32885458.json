Daily UVA exposures are weighted to the anatomical human cheek (anterior infra-orbital region) for teachers wearing and not wearing broad-brimmed hats. The method utilizes the OMI UVA irradiance data collected daily at high temporal resolution over 2005 to 2016 to derive the total daily UVA exposure to a horizontal plane. These horizontal plane exposures are scaled by factors to take into account the timing of outdoor activity. The relationship between exposures to a horizontal plane and those to a vertical plane and the protection provided by a broad-brimmed hat was assessed to evaluate the total daily UVA exposures to the cheek for classroom and physical education teaching staff expected to be outside at different periods of the day. The developed method enables the total daily UVA exposure to specific anatomical sites to be evaluated from the satellite solar noon irradiance at locations that do not have access to surface-based instrumentation capable of recording in the solar UVA waveband."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 American Society for Photobiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Department, Faculty of Sciences, University of Thi Qar, Nasiriyah, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Jebar", "ForeName": "Mustapha A A", "Initials": "MAA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3191-6404"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Applied Climate Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."}], "LastName": "Downs", "ForeName": "Nathan J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8430-8907"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Applied Climate Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."}], "LastName": "Parisi", "ForeName": "Alfio V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4106-6295"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."}], "LastName": "Turner", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Kalliskota, S., J.
