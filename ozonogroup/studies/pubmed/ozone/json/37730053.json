Serum neural damage biomarkers, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurofilament light chain (NfL), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) were measured at each follow-up session. Personal O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels were calculated based on outdoor monitoring and sampling times. A linear mixed-effects model was adopted to quantify the acute effect of O<sub>3</sub> on serum neural damage biomarkers. Stratification analysis based on sex, education level, physical activity, and glutathione S-transferases (GST) gene polymorphism analysis was performed to explore their potential modifying effects.", "A total of 34 healthy volunteers aged 63.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 y were enlisted and completed the study. The concentration of the daily maximum 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) ranged from 19.5 to 160.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> during the study period. Regression analysis showed that short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated positively with serum concentrations of neural damage biomarkers. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O<sub>3</sub>-8h exposure was associated with an increment of 74\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI:1\u00a0%-146\u00a0%) and 197\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI:39\u00a0%-356\u00a0%) in BDNF (lag 2 d) and NfL (lag 1 d), respectively. The stratification results suggest that males, people with lower education levels, lower physical activity, and GST theta 1 (GSTT1)-sufficient genotype might be marginally more vulnerable.", "This study provides new evidence for the neural damage risk posed by O<sub>3</sub> exposure, even at relatively low concentrations, which, therefore, requires that stringent air quality standards be developed and implemented."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
