Cleaning and shaping of the canal were performed using the crown down technique followed by obturation of the canal space. Canal space was prepared using peso reamers and samples were divided into four groups based on types of canal disinfectant protocols. Group 1: Riboflavin+ 17%EDTA; group 2: Curcumin Photosensitizer\u00a0+\u00a017% EDTA; group 3: Gaseous Ozone disinfection (O3) +17% EDTA and group 4 control 2.5% NaOCl +17% EDTA. Within the canal space, fiber post was cemented and cured, and thermocycled. PBS was evaluated using a Universal testing machine (UTM) and failure modes using a stereomicroscope at 40x magnification. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the mean and standard deviation of push-out bond strength (PBS). The Tukey multiple comparison tests (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) was used to compare the means of PBS.", "The highest PBS was displayed in group 2 CP+ 17% EDTA at all three root levels, coronal (8.81\u00b10.61), middle (7.77\u00b10.55), and apical (5.25\u00b10.61). The lowest PBS was revealed in group 4, disinfected with 2.5% NaOCl +17% EDTA (control) at coronal (6.12\u00b10.54), middle (5.46\u00b10.84), and apical (3.00\u00b11.88) levels. The most prevailed fracture mode was an adhesive failure (cement-dentin interface).", "Radicular dentin disinfected with PDT using CP, riboflavin, and O3 displayed similar PBS at all root segments. NaOCl is a convenient, traditional, and commonly used disinfectant, and it's effects on PBS is still controversial."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
