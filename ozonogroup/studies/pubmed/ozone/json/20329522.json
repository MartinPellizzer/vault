It was found that, the genotoxicity of effluent of O3-BAC before disinfection ranged from 20-70 ng/L, and it increased after disinfection by chlorine or chloramines. With the same reaction time(24 h), genotoxicity after chlorination (40-95 ng/L) was higher than that after chloramination (20-40 ng/L) under same initial dosage. For chlorination, with initial dosage increasing from 0 mg/L to 10 mg/L, genotoxicity increased firstly, and got the maximum value at about 0.5-1 mg/L dosage, then decreased and got the minimum value at about 3-5 mg/L dosage, and finally increased again. For chloramination, genotoxicity didn't change that much. With the dosage of 3 mg/L and reaction time increasing from 0 h to 72 h, no matter for chlorine or chloramines disinfection, genotoxicity of effluent of O3-BAC both increased firstly, and got the maximum value at about 2 h, then decreased and got the minimum value at about 18 h, and finally increased again, and genotoxicity after chlorine disinfection (83-120 ng/L) was higher than that after chloramines disinfection (20-62 ng/L) under same reaction time. Further more, effects of the different ratios of Cl2 to N of disinfectant on genotoxicity of effluent of O3-BAC were also studied. Results of this study demonstrate that under test conditions, chloramine disinfection is safer than chlorine disinfection in the aspect of genotoxicity for drinking water, and the changes of genotoxicity are different from those of total HAAs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. qing-liu06@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wen-Jun", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Xue-Biao", "Initials": "XB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Su-Xia", "Initials": "SX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shun", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KW8K411A1P", "NameOfSubstance": "chloramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20329522"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
