SCR was conducted with space velocity (SV)=2400 hr(-1) and hybrid SNCR/SCR with SV=6000 hr(-1), since the study focused on reducing the amount of catalyst and both achieved 98% NOx reduction efficiency. Characteristics of NOx reduction by NH3 were studied for low-temperature SCR system at 150 \u00b0C using Mn-V2O5/TiO2 catalyst. Mn-added V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was produced, and selective catalyst reduction of NOx by NH3 was experimented. NOx reduction rate according to added Mn content in Mn-V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was studied with varying conditions of reaction temperature, normalized stoichiometric ratio (NSR), SV, and O2 concentration. In the catalyst experiment according to V2O5 concentration, 1 wt.% V2O5 catalyst showed the highest NOx reduction rate: 98% reduction at temperature window of 200~250 \u00b0C. As a promoter of the V2O5 catalyst, 5 wt.% Mn was added, and the catalyst showed 47~90% higher efficiency even with low temperatures, 100~200 \u00b0C. Mn-V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, prepared by adding 5 wt.% Mn in V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, showed increments of catalyst activation at 150 \u00b0C as well as NOx reduction. Mn-V2O5/TiO2 catalyst showed 8% higher rate for NOx reduction compared with V2O5/TiO2 catalyst in 150 \u00b0C SCR. Thus, (5 wt.%)Mn-(1 wt.%)V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was applied in SCR of hybrid SNCR/SCR system of low temperature at 150 \u00b0C. Low-temperature SCR hybrid SNCR/SCR (150 \u00b0C) system and hybrid SNCR/SCR (350 \u00b0C) showed 91~95% total reduction rate with conditions of SV=2400~6000 hr(-1) SCR and 850~1050 \u00b0C SNCR, NSR=1.5~2.0, and 5% O2. Hybrid SNCR/SCR (150 \u00b0C) system proved to be more effective than the hybrid SNCR/SCR (350 \u00b0C) system at low temperature.", "NOx control is very important, since they are the part of greenhouse gases as well as the cause of acid rain and ozone hole. A technology, so-called hybrid SNCR/SCR process, was tested using Mn-V2O5/TiO2 monolithic catalyst for NOx reduction, and the method is promising. The results of this study would provide some ideas to parties such as policy makers, environmental engineers, and so on."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Science , School of Environment, Keimyung University , Daegu , South Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Sung-Woo", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Sang-Ki", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Hun-Kyun", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vanadium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BVG363OH7A", "NameOfSubstance": "vanadium pentoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vanadium Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25947218", "10.1080/10962247.2014.1002584"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
