Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were included in our study. External auditory canal and tympanic membrane examinations were normal in all rats. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. Initially, all the rats were tested with distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and emissions were measured normally. All rats were injected with 5-mg/kg/day cisplatin for 3\u00a0days intraperitoneally. Ototoxicy had developed in all rats, as confirmed with DPOAE after 1\u00a0week. Rectal and intratympanic ozone therapy group was Group 1. No treatment was administered for the rats in Group 2 as the control group. The rats in Group 3 were treated with rectal ozone. All the rats were tested with DPOAE under general anesthesia, and all were sacrificed for pathological examination 1\u00a0week after ozone administration. Their cochleas were removed. The outer hair cell damage and stria vascularis damage were examined. In the statistical analysis conducted, a statistically significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 was observed in all frequencies according to the DPOAE test. In addition, between Group 2 and Group 3, a statistically significant difference was observed in the DPOAE test. However, a statistically significant difference was not observed between Group 1 and Group 3 according to the DPOAE test. According to histopathological scoring, the outer hair cell damage score was statistically significantly high in Group 2 compared with Group 1. In addition, the outer hair cell damage score was also statistically significantly high in Group 2 compared with Group 3. Outer hair cell damage scores were low in Group 1 and Group 3, but there was no statistically significant difference between these groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of stria vascularis damage score examinations. Systemic ozone gas therapy is effective in the treatment of cell damage in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. The intratympanic administration of ozone gas does not have any additional advantage over the rectal administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ko\u00e7ak", "ForeName": "Hasan Emre", "Initials": "HE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ba\u011fc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ta\u015fk\u0131n", "ForeName": "\u00dcmit", "Initials": "\u00dc"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ba\u011fc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ayd\u0131n", "ForeName": "Salih", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ba\u011fc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Oktay", "ForeName": "Mehmet Faruk", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Ba\u011fc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Alt\u0131nay", "ForeName": "Serdar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ba\u011fc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital Experimental Surgical Research and Skill Improvement Training Center, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7elik", "ForeName": "Duygu Sultan", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospitalist Hospital, Ba\u011fc\u0131lar, \u0130stanbul, Turkey. kadiryucebas@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Y\u00fcceba\u015f", "ForeName": "Kadir", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ba\u011fc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Alta\u015f", "ForeName": "Beng\u00fcl", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol", "NlmUniqueID": "9002937", "ISSNLinking": "0937-4477"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cochlea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stria Vascularis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2012 Jan;269(1):45-52", "ArticleIdList": ["21442422"]}, {"Citation": "Tohoku J Exp Med. 2009 Nov;219(3):177-86", "ArticleIdList": ["19851045"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jun;22(3):305-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10362343"]}, {"Citation": "J Laryngol Otol. 2009 Jun;123(6):590-7", "ArticleIdList": ["19144244"]}, {"Citation": "Laryngoscope. 2001 Jul;111(7):1147-55", "ArticleIdList": ["11568534"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2006 Nov 1;216(3):493-504", "ArticleIdList": ["16890971"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2003 Feb;67(2):133-9", "ArticleIdList": ["12623149"]}, {"Citation": "Hear Res. 2003 Dec;186(1-2):10-6", "ArticleIdList": ["14644455"]}, {"Citation": "J Contemp Dent Pract. 2008 May 01;9(4):75-84", "ArticleIdList": ["18473030"]}, {"Citation": "Hear Res. 2004 Jul;193(1-2):25-30", "ArticleIdList": ["15219317"]}, {"Citation": "Auris Nasus Larynx. 2001 Jan;28(1):9-14", "ArticleIdList": ["11137357"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27221387", "10.1007/s00405-016-4104-4", "10.1007/s00405-016-4104-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
