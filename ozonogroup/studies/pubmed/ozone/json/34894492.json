The Linhai Special Industrial Complex (LSIC), which is the largest heavy industrial zone in Taiwan, and other industrial zones and storage station of petrochemicals are adjacent to the Kaohsiung Port. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are discharged from industrial processes in this large industrial area, are likely to cause the poor ambient air quality and atmospheric visibility in Kaohsiung City. This study uses the continuous monitoring data of 54 VOCs during 2018-2020\u00a0at eight air quality monitoring stations in the industrialized city to evaluate the spatiotemporal distributions and seasonal variations of VOC concentrations. Principal component analysis and ratios of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) are used to track the potential sources of VOCs for different stations. The highest average concentration of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) was observed in winter (32.54\u00a0ppb), while the lowest TVOC concentration was observed in summer (25.84\u00a0ppb), which is related to the prevailing wind directions of monsoons. Kaohsiung is located in the weak monsoon wake area, and air pollutants are easily accumulated in the winter. The southwest wind prevailing in summer results in good diffusion and frequent rainfalls. However, the Qijin station close to the seashore has the highest average TVOC concentration among the eight stations. The seasonal prevailing winds caused the average TVOC concentrations in summer (41.3\u00a0ppb) to be higher than that in winter (31.62\u00a0ppb) at the Qijin station. It was attributed to the fact that the Qijin Peninsula is vulnerable to VOC emissions from ship sailing in the Taiwan Strait, the processing and export zone, and the shipbuilding yards nearby the Kaohsiung Harbor. Comparing the BTEX ratios of Kaohsiung City with the data of Hong Kong, we found that VOCs were mainly from industrial emissions in Kaohsiung City, which were significantly different from Hong Kong that VOCs were mainly emitted from traffic emissions. Overall, VOCs in Kaohsiung City have been decreased from 2018 to 2020; however, according to the analytical results of ozone formation potential, toluene and m,p-xylenes are the most potential photochemical precursors for ozone formation. The government should enforce and regulate aromatic hydrocarbons from industrial emission sources to reduce the potential formation of ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
