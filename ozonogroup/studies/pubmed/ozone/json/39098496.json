The research integrates consumer tests, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) with Solid phase Microextraction (SPME) fiber and Electronic Nose (e-nose) analysis to conduct a detailed assessment of the cheese's aromatic composition. Results indicate that low ozone concentrations significantly affected spoilage microflora, preserving the overall quality. Through GC-FID (Flame Ionization Detection) analysis, 22 of all identified compounds by GC-MS were quantified, including ethyl acetate (sweety), diacetyl and acetoin (buttery). Compared with the untreated sample, ozone treatments maintained the distinctive characteristics of Toma Piemontese PDO cheese, reducing the formation of off-flavors-related compounds (i.e., ethanol). Moreover, ozone-treated samples correlated with positive aroma scores given by consumers. However, sensory perception involves complex interactions among aroma compounds, highlighting the importance of advanced approaches. The utilization of a 12-sensor Quartz Microbalance (QMB) e-nose played a crucial role in identifying subtle differences in aroma, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of ozone treatments on the cheese's sensory profile. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the potential of ozone technology as a viable and effective method for improving the quality of aged Toma Piemontese PDO cheese."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024, The Authors.
