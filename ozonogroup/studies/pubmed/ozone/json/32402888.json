Increasing O<sub>3</sub> levels in India particularly in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is a major issue as it is reducing the crop yield. The present study is an attempt to determine the O<sub>3</sub> and its precursor trend using continuous ground-based observations at a suburban site in IGP. The study focuses on the overall characteristics of annual, monthly, diurnal and hourly measurements of O<sub>3</sub>. Annual mean values of O<sub>3</sub> have shown an increment of 19.2% from 2010 to 2015. Similarly, nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) levels increased by 30.2%. O<sub>3</sub> levels at the study site showed a significant increasing trend of 0.7\u00a0ppb/yr. The observed O<sub>3</sub> trend was analyzed in terms of changes in NO<sub>x</sub> levels and meteorological parameters. No significant difference in meteorological parameters was observed during 2010-15, however, NO<sub>x</sub> levels have shown an increasing trend of 0.9\u00a0ppb/yr. Further to quantify the impact of increasing O<sub>3</sub> on crops, ozone-related crop yield losses for rice and wheat crop were determined for the period 2010-15. AOT40 (accumulated ozone exposure over a threshold of 40\u00a0ppb) and M7 (mean 7-h O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratio from 09:00 to 15:59 LT) O<sub>3</sub> exposure metrics were used to calculate the reduction in crop yield during major crop growing seasons: Rabi and Kharif."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
