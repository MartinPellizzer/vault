The result shown that gamma-alumina was activated in catalytic ozonation for degradation MIB not only in distilled water, but also in tap water. In distilled water condition, catalyzed ozonation could enhance 47% removal efficiency; in tap water condition, catalyzed ozonation could increase 40% removal efficiency. The concentration of ozone, gamma-alumina, MIB can affect the degradation of MIB observably. gamma-Alumina catalyzed ozonation for removing MIB did not depend on rigidity in water, but was affected by inorganic negative ions. By capturing the hydroxyl radicals produced by gamma-alumina catalyzed ozone decomposition, the bicarbonate/carbonate in natural water can restrain the effect of gamma-alumina catalyzed ozonation for degradation of MIB. Lower concentration of humic acid can promote the effect of oxidation of the MIB, but higher concentration of humic acid may reduce the efficiency. As pH values can affect the process of catalyzed ozonation and tert-butyl alcohol can inhibit the efficiency of catalyzed ozonation efficiency of MIB, the mechanism of gamma-alumina enhanced ozone oxidation of MIB can be identified as that gamma-alumina catalyzed ozone to decompose into hydroxyl radicals which further break up the molecule of MIB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zhonglinchen@hit.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-Lin", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bing-Bing", "Initials": "BB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Ji-Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Miao-Miao", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2371-42-8", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methylisoborneol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17489191"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
