We conducted an ecological study using 7 years of data from 162 countries. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and incidence data were used to represent the breast cancer disease burden. Particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were adopted as our exposures. We employed generalized linear mixed models to explore the relationship between air pollution and greenness on breast cancer disease burden. The rate ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) indicate the effect size. There is a positive association between air pollution and the burden of breast cancer disease. Contrarily, per interquartile range increment in NDVI was negatively associated with DALYs and incidence. In terms of air pollutants and breast cancer, NDVI seems to have a significant influence on the relationship between these two conditions. A higher amount of greenness helps to alleviate the negative association of air pollution on breast cancer. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> play a mediating role in the relationship between greenness and breast cancer disease burden. In areas with higher levels of greenness, there is a possibility that the inverse association between air pollutants and the burden of breast cancer may be influenced."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
