Cholesterol, Thioretinaco Ozonide, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, and Prevention of Mortality.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "425", "EndPage": "438", "MedlinePgn": "425-438"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The purpose of this review is to elucidate how low blood cholesterol promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and mortality by the loss of thioretinaco ozonide from opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Mortality from infections and cancer are both inversely associated with blood cholesterol, as determined by multiple cohort studies from 10 to 30 years earlier. Moreover, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is inversely related to all-cause and/or cardiovascular mortality, as determined by followup study of elderly cohorts. LDL adheres to and inactivates most microorganisms and their toxins, causing aggregation of LDL and homocysteinylated autoantibodies which obstruct vasa vasorum and produce intimal microabscesses, the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. The active site of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) biosynthesis is proposed to consist of thioretinaco, a complex of two molecules of thioretinamide with cobalamin, oxidized to the disulfonium thioretinaco ozonide and complexed with oxygen, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), phosphate, and ATP. Loss of the active site complex from mitochondria results from the opening of the mPTP and from decomposition of the disulfonium active site by electrophilic carcinogens, oncogenic viruses, microbes, and by reactive oxygen radicals from ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Suppression of innate immunity is caused by the depletion of adenosyl methionine because of increased polyamine biosynthesis, resulting in inhibition of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite biosynthesis. Opening of the mPTP produces a loss of thioretinaco ozonide from mitochondria. This loss impairs ATP biosynthesis and causes the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, aging and dementia. Cholesterol inhibits the opening of the mPTP by preventing integration of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This inhibition explains how elevated LDL reduces mitochondrial dysfunction by preventing loss of the active site of oxidative phosphorylation from mitochondria."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service, Boston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA kilmer.mccully@va.gov."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCully", "ForeName": "Kilmer S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Clin Lab Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0410247", "ISSNLinking": "0091-7370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "thioretinaco"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0LVT1QZ0BA", "NameOfSubstance": "Homocysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P6YC3EG204", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin B 12"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Homocysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin B 12"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31471331", "49/4/425"]}}]}
