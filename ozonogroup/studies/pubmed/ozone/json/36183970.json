Here, we designed and synthesized an on-demand microwave-controlled ozone release nanosystem to specifically generate reactive oxygen species in tumor mass. By taking advantage of iRGD modification, the synthesized nanosystem can be specifically enriched in the tumor microenvironment and subsequently internalized by tumor cells. Triggered by the low-power microwave, ozone was released from the nanocarriers and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Molecular mechanism investigation further unraveled that the released-ozone induced cytolytic cell death through the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical. The tumor-specific neoantigen derived from this immunogenic cell death promoted cytotoxic T-lymphocytes infiltration, which provided a fundament for immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In the triple-negative breast cancer animal model, tumor-specific delivery of ozone significantly improved the systematical anti-tumor efficacy of the PD-1 blockade antibody. Notably, tumor-locally confined microwave-controlled release avoided systematic toxicity in the tested animals. Collectively, our nanosystem provides a novel controllable strategy for promoting immune checkpoint blockade therapy, especially in tumor types deficient in infiltrated T-lymphocytes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
