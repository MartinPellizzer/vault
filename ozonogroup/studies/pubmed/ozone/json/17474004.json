Oxidation processes were carried out in a stirred tank reactor at the natural pH of the wastewater and 25 degrees C, analyzing the effect of the hydraulic residence time and applied ozone mass flow on color and organic matter removals. Ozone consumption was also measured in each experiment. The results show that continuous ozonation was effective for decolorization of molasses wastewater. Operating with a hydraulic residence time of 45 minutes and an applied ozone mass flow of 1.7 g/h, color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reductions were about 80% and 14%, respectively. Increasing the hydraulic residence time or ozone mass flow led to a considerably increase in the ozone consumption, with similar color and organic matter reduction percentages. Slightly higher removal percentages were obtained combining ozone with hydrogen peroxide, attaining 83% color reduction and 20% COD removal. As consequence of the oxidation processes, biodegradability of the decolorized effluent increased about 40-50% and the ratio BOD5/COD was twofold higher."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Tecnolog\u00eda del Medio Ambiente, Universidad de Valladolid, Spain. pena@iq.uva.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pe\u00f1a", "ForeName": "Mar", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coca", "ForeName": "M\u00f3nica", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "Gerardo", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molasses"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17474004", "10.1080/10934520701304450", "778063764"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
