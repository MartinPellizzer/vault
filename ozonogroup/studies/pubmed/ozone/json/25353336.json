The current treatment for this illness includes surgery, radio and chemotherapy, showing relapse in patients treated with those therapies. Since the ozone was found to be an effective bioreactive to inhibit growth of several carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In this research, therapeutic peritoneum insufflation of ozone/oxygen dissolved in the physiological solution of NaCl 0.9% was dosed for fifteen days on different female mice groups in an advanced stage of C6 tumor (n=6). The first of them was the control group which had no treatment, the second group was dosage with oxygen every second day, the third group was dosed with ozone every second day, and finally the fourth group was dosed with ozone dissolved every fifth day. The size of the tumor was higher in both groups dosage by ozone, nevertheless tumor activity measured by microPET was 98% less in the fourth group compared with the control group. That result proves that ozone provokes an increase in the tumor volume even though the decrease of the cell activity. Those results were confirmed by the quantification of hydroperoxides, total cholesterol and total triglycerides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Escuela Superior de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica e Industrias Extractivas del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional (ESIQIEIPN,), Edif. 7, UPALM, C.P. 07738, M\u00e9xico D.F., M\u00e9xico. ariz_pema@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "Arizbeth", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Santos Cuevas", "ForeName": "Clara L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chairez", "ForeName": "Isaac", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Poznyak", "ForeName": "Tatyana", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ordaz-Rosado", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Becerra", "ForeName": "Roc\u00edo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Romero Pi\u00f1a", "ForeName": "Mario E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Glioma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Nude"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25353336", "10.2174/1871520614666141027143914", "ACAMC-EPUB-63071"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
