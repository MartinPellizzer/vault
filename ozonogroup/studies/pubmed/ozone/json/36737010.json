To acquire reasonable NO<sub>x</sub> simulation results for further analysis, a reasonable emission inventory is needed for three-dimensional chemical transport models (3D-CTMs). In this study, a comprehensive emission adjustment framework for NO<sub>x</sub> emission, which integrates the simulation results of the 3D-CTM, surface NO<sub>2</sub> measurements, the three-dimensional variational data assimilation method, and an ensemble back propagation neural network, was proposed and applied to correct NO<sub>x</sub> emissions over China for the summers of 2015 and 2020. Compared with the simulation using prior NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, the root-mean-square error, normalized mean error, and normalized mean bias decreased by approximately 40 %, 40 %, and 60 % in NO<sub>2</sub> simulation using posterior NO<sub>x</sub> emissions corrected by the framework proposed in this work. Compared with the emissions for 2015, the NO<sub>x</sub> emission generally decreased by an average of 5 % in the simulation domain for 2020, especially in Henan and Anhui provinces, where the percentage reductions reached 24 % and 19 %, respectively. The proposed framework is sufficiently flexible to correct emissions in other periods and regions. The framework can provide reliable and up-to-date emission information and can thus contribute to both scientific research and policy development relating to NO<sub>x</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
