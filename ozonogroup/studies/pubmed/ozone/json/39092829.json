Limited observations point to a continuous increase in UT O<sub>3</sub> in recent decades, but the attribution of UT O<sub>3</sub> changes is complicated by large internal climate variability. We show that the anthropogenic signal (\"fingerprint\") in the patterns of UT O<sub>3</sub> increases is distinguishable from the background noise of internal variability. The time-invariant fingerprint of human-caused UT O<sub>3</sub> changes is derived from a 16-member initial-condition ensemble performed with a chemistry-climate model (CESM2-WACCM6). The fingerprint is largest between 30\u00b0S and 40\u00b0N, especially near 30\u00b0N. In contrast, the noise pattern in UT O<sub>3</sub> is mainly associated with the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The UT O<sub>3</sub> fingerprint pattern can be discerned with high confidence within only 13 years of the 2005 start of the OMI/MLS satellite record. Unlike the UT O<sub>3</sub> fingerprint, the lower tropospheric (LT) O<sub>3</sub> fingerprint varies significantly over time and space in response to large-scale changes in anthropogenic precursor emissions, with the highest signal-to-noise ratios near 40\u00b0N in Asia and Europe. Our analysis reveals a significant human effect on Earth's atmospheric chemistry in the UT and indicates promise for identifying fingerprints of specific sources of ozone precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0006-9993-6053"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xinyuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Fiore", "ForeName": "Arlene M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Oceanography Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, Massachusetts 02543, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States."}], "LastName": "Santer", "ForeName": "Benjamin D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, New York 10964, United States."}], "LastName": "Correa", "ForeName": "Gustavo P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado 80307, United States."}], "LastName": "Lamarque", "ForeName": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland 21251, United States."}], "LastName": "Ziemke", "ForeName": "Jerald R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2476-4801"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Eastham", "ForeName": "Sebastian D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Qindan", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39092829", "10.1021/acs.est.4c01289"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
