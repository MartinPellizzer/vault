We investigated the association between acute stroke mortality and air pollution over a 7-year period (January 1991 through December 1997) in Seoul, Korea.", "A generalized additive model was used to regress daily stroke death counts for each air pollutant, controlling for time trends, day of the week, and meteorological influences such as temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke deaths were examined separately.", "The effects of air pollutants on ischemic stroke mortality were statistically significant, whereas this was not the case for hemorrhagic stroke mortality. We observed estimated relative risks of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.08) for ischemic stroke mortality for each interquartile range increase in total suspended particulates and sulfur dioxide concentrations on the same day. We also found significantly increased relative risks of 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.07) for nitrogen dioxide with a 1-day lag, of 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.09) for carbon monoxide with a 1-day lag, and of 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.10) for ozone with a 3-day lag for each interquartile range increase.", "These findings indicate that air pollutants are significantly associated with ischemic stroke mortality, which suggests an acute pathogenetic process in the cerebrovascular system induced by air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Inha University College of Medicine, Jung-Gu, Incheon, Korea. ychong@inha.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Yun-Chul", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jong-Tae", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ho", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Ho-Jang", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Stroke", "NlmUniqueID": "0235266", "ISSNLinking": "0039-2499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comorbidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poisson Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12215581", "10.1161/01.str.0000026865.52610.5b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
