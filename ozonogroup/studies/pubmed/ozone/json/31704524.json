This study investigated the elimination of UVQS in mature landfill leachates through a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter (SAARB). Humus (i.e., fulvic and humic acids) was the main component of organic matter in both MBR- and SAARB-treated landfill leachates, while there was a more stable chemical structure of humus in the MBR-treated leachate. The concentration of UVQS in MBR-treated mature landfill leachate was higher than that of SAARB-treated leachate. Ozonation can degrade UVQS effectively, especially for landfill leachate containing a high concentration UVQS (i.e., MBR-treated landfill leachate). However, a large accumulation of small molecule acid might be caused by ozonation for highly concentrated UVQS in landfill leachate, leading to the delayed degradation of total organic carbon. Moreover, ozonation degraded both fulvic acid and humic acid; and degraded humic acid more effectively. For instance, 88.0% removal (MBR-CP2) and 96.0% removal (SAARB-CP2) of humic acid was higher than those (83.3% for MBR-CP1 and 92.3% for SAARB-CP1) of fulvic acid. The destruction of UV-quenching functional groups of organics (such as CC) by ozone was the main UVQS degradation mechanism of ozonation applied to MBR- and SAARB-treated landfill leachates. Therefore, the ozonation process can efficiently decrease UV absorption intensity in both MBR- and SAARB-treated landfill leachates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
