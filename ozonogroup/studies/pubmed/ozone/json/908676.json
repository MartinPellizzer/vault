Prior to ozone exposure, inhalation of histamine aerosol (2% solution; 5 breaths) increased total pulmonary resistance (RL) 5.1 +/- 0.5 cmH2O/1 per s (mean +/- SE). One day after ozone exposure (0.7-1.2 ppm; 2 h), the base-line RL was not significantly changed (P greater than 0.05), but the increase of RL caused by histamine (10.7 +/- 1.1 cmH2O/1 per s) was greater than in the control state (P less than 0.01). When the dogs were pretreated with atropine sulfate aerosol (1.5% solution; 10 breaths), the increase of RL after histamine was decreased to 3.8 +/- 0.3 cmH2O/1 per s before ozone, and this was not significantly different after ozone (4.5 +/- 1.1 cmH2O/1 per s; P greater than 0.5). Cooling blockade of conduction in the vagus nerves diminished the increase of RL after histamine to 3.9 +/- 0.5 cmH2O/1 per s before ozone, and this was not significantly different after ozone (4.4 +/- 0.6 cmH2O/1 per s; P less than 0.5). Since both atropine and vagal cooling abolished the ozone-induced bronchial hyperirritability, we conclude that it is mediated via vagal cholinergic pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bleecker", "ForeName": "E R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nadel", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "innervation"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinergic Fibers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vagus Nerve"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["908676", "10.1152/jappl.1977.43.4.626"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
