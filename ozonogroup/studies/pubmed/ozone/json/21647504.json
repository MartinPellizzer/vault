The selective detection has been assessed using a variety of coatings: beeswax, gallic acid, indigo carmine, polybutadiene, potassium iodide and sodium nitrite. Polybutadiene was the most sensitive with a limit of detection of 55 ppb. The sensitivity was improved by operating at higher harmonics and was shown to increase linearly with harmonic up to the 11th harmonic. This novel work shows that ozone detection can be improved by operating at the crystal's harmonic frequencies and in conjunction with a suitable flow rate, a potentially highly sensitive and fast response sensor can be created based on acoustic wave technology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, The School of Earth Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muller", "ForeName": "Jennifer B A", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Ceri E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newton", "ForeName": "Michael I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Analyst", "NlmUniqueID": "0372652", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2654"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21647504", "10.1039/c1an15106a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
