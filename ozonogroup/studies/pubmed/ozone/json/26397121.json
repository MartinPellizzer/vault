The codeposition of cp2Fe with O3 and of n-butyl cp2Fe with O3 into an argon matrix led to the production of 1:1 charge-transfer complexes with absorptions at 765 and 815 nm, respectively. These absorptions contribute to the green matrix color observed upon initial deposition. The charge-transfer complexes underwent photochemical reactions upon irradiation with red light (\u03bb \u2265 600 nm). Theoretical UV-vis spectra of the charge-transfer complexes and photochemical products were calculated using TD-DFT at the B3LYP/6-311G++(d,2p) level of theory. The calculated UV-vis spectra were in good agreement with the experimental results. MO analysis of these long-wavelength transitions showed them to be n\u2192 \u03c0* on the ozone subunit in the complex and indicated that the formation of the charge-transfer complex between ozone and cp2Fe or n-butyl cp2Fe affects how readily the \u03c0* orbital on O3 is populated when red light (\u03bb \u2265 600 nm) is absorbed. 1:1 complexes of cp2Fe and n-butyl cp2Fe with O2 were also observed experimentally and calculated theoretically. These results support and enhance previous infrared studies of the mechanism of photooxidation of ferrocene by ozone, a reaction that has considerable significance for the formation of iron oxide thin films for a range of applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati , P.O.
