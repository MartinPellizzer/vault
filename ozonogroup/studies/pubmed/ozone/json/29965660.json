The results showed that the ten year average concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> at the Dingling site were the highest at 65.2 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, followed by concentrations at Liulihe (53.4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>), Guanyuan (49.6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) and Qianmen (40.4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>). The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at Dingling showed a decreasing trend[0.5 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>], while O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at Guanyuan[0.9 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>], Liulihe[0.3 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>], and Qianmen[0.3 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>] showed an increasing trend. The highest monthly average concentrations appeared during June and August, and the highest frequency occurred in July (17 times) with average concentrations of 99.8 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The lowest monthly average concentrations appeared during November and February, and the highest frequency occurred in January (14 times) with an average concentration of 16.6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Notably, the time for the peak concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> appeared earlier in the day in recent years. The peak concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> appeared at 15:00-16:00 during 2013-2015, which was 1-2 hours earlier than previous years. The heavy air pollution of O<sub>3</sub> occurred on 11 days at the Dingling site in 2015, which was ten days more than in 2013, indicating O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the downwind suburban regions of Beijing in summer became more and more serious. The concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> at Dingling showed a positive correlation, while the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> at the other sites showed a negative correlation, indicating O<sub>3</sub> formation in Dingling was sensitive to NO<sub>2</sub> chemistry, while O<sub>3</sub> formation at the other sites was sensitive to VOC chemistry. The concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> showed a positive correlation with temperature and negative correlations with humidity and surface pressure. Temperature had the greatest influence on O<sub>3</sub> concentration, followed by surface pressure and humidity. For cases when daily maximum temperature exceeded 30\u2103 and relative humidity was between 30% and 70%, the probability of the O<sub>3</sub> daily maximum 8 h concentration exceeding 200 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> was high, indicating the air quality level reached levels for light pollution and moderate pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particulate Monitoring Technology, Beijing 100048, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhan-Shan", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particulate Monitoring Technology, Beijing 100048, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particulate Monitoring Technology, Beijing 100048, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Xin-Xin", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particulate Monitoring Technology, Beijing 100048, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particulate Monitoring Technology, Beijing 100048, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Nai-di", "Initials": "ND"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particulate Monitoring Technology, Beijing 100048, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bu-Ying", "Initials": "BY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particulate Monitoring Technology, Beijing 100048, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jin-Xiu", "Initials": "JX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965660", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201705276"]}}]}
