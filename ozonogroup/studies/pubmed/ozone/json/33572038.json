Investigated AOPs included UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, UV/Cl<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/UV, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV, and the new Cl<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV. AOPs comparison was accomplished using various ozone doses (0-9\u00a0mg/L), UV fluences (191-981\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) and radical promoter concentrations of Cl<sub>2</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.04\u00a0mM and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u00a0mM. Chlorine-based AOPs produced radical species that reacted more selectively with pharmaceuticals than radical species and oxidants generated by other AOPs. Tryptophan-like substances and humic-like fluorescing compounds were the most degraded components by all AOPs, which were better removed than microbial products and fulvic-like fluorescing substances. Removal of UV absorbance at 254 (UV<sub>254</sub>) nm was always low. Overall, chlorine-based AOPs were more effective to reduce fluorescence intensities than similar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-based AOPs. The Cl<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV process was the most effective AOP to degrade all target micro-pollutants except primidone. On the other hand, the oxidation performance of pharmaceuticals by other ozone-based AOPs followed the order H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV\u00a0>\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>/UV\u00a0>\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. UV/Cl<sub>2</sub> process outcompeted UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only for the removal of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Correlations between the removal of pharmaceuticals and spectroscopic indexes (PARAFAC components and UV<sub>254</sub>) had unique regression parameters for each compound, surrogate parameter and oxidation process. Particularly, a diverse PARAFAC component for each investigated AOP resulted to be the most sensitive surrogate parameter able to monitor small changes of pharmaceuticals removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
