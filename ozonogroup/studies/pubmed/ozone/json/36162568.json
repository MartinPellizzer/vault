This study aims to investigate the joint effect of air pollutant mixtures on a broad range of cardiometabolic parameters, examine the susceptibility of obese individuals, and determine the role of circulating fatty acids. In this panel study, metabolically healthy normal-weight (MH-NW, n = 49) and obese (MHO, n = 39) adults completed three longitudinal visits (257 person-visits in total). Personal exposure levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO and BC were estimated based on fixed-site monitoring data, time-activity logs and infiltration factor method. Blood pressure, glycemic homeostasis, lipid profiles, systematic inflammation and coagulation biomarkers were measured. Targeted metabolomics was used to quantify twenty-eight plasma free fatty acids (FFAs). Bayesian kernel machine regression models were applied to establish the exposure-response relationships and identify key pollutants. Significant joint effects of measured air pollutants on systematic inflammation and coagulation biomarkers were observed in the MHO group, instead of the MH-NW group. Lipid profiles showed the most significant changes in both groups and O<sub>3</sub> contributed the most to the total effect. Specific FFA patterns were identified, and de novo lipogenesis (DNL)-related pattern was most closely related to blood lipid profiles. In particular, interaction analysis suggested that DNL-related FFA pattern augmented the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on triglyceride (TG, P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.040), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.106) and TG/HDL-C (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.020) in the MHO group but not MH-NW group. This modification was further confirmed by interaction analysis with estimated activity of SCD1, a key enzyme in the DNL pathway. Therefore, despite being metabolically healthy, obese subjects have a higher cardiometabolic susceptibility to air pollution, especially O<sub>3</sub>, and the DNL pathway may represent an intrinsic driver of lipid susceptibility. This study provides new insights into the cardiometabolic susceptibility of obese individuals to air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
