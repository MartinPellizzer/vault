Here we explore spatial air pollution and human health disparities in the Coachella Valley with particular attention to disparities arising across population characteristics including both socioeconomic and demographic vulnerabilities. We use two different measures of respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes at the individual and census tract levels - one measure based on a randomly sampled telephone survey and the other measure based on emergency room visitation data - to investigate the degree to which these health outcomes are connected to air pollution and socioeconomic metrics. We further investigate biases and differences between the health outcome metrics themselves and suggest opportunities to address them in future analyses and survey efforts. We find that more vulnerable communities are associated with higher levels of fine particulates, but lower levels of ozone. While emergency visit rates show a significant positive correlation with both pollutants, no such association is found when using surveyed health outcome data. The ratio of emergency visits versus survey rates shows a positive relationship with socioeconomic and demographic vulnerability, indicating that vulnerable communities are less likely to self-report diagnoses despite higher rates of respiratory or cardiovascular hospitalization. Additionally, survey respondents tend to show less vulnerability relative to their surrounding census-based demographics. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to health issues specifically within disadvantaged communities in the Coachella Valley, building upon and working within existing community networks and local resources, to better address current and projected health needs. Our findings also highlight disparities in air pollution exposure, health outcomes, and population characteristics in the Coachella Valley, providing context for crucial pollution reduction efforts in the face of increasing environmental threats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
