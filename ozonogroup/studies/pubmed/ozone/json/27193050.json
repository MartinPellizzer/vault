We remeasured its rate constant to reduce its uncertainty and extended the measurements to lower mesospheric temperatures using modern laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques. H atoms were produced by pulsed ultraviolet laser trace photolysis of O3, followed by reaction of O((1)D) with added H2. A second, delayed, frequency-mixed dye laser measured the reaction decay rate with the remaining ozone using LIF. We monitored either the H atom decay by two photon excitation at 205 nm and detection of red fluorescence, or the OH (v = 9) product time evolution with excitation of the B(2)\u03a3(+)-X(2)\u03a0 (0,9) band at 237 nm and emission in the blue B(2)\u03a3(+)-A(2)\u03a3(+) (0,7) band. By cooling the enclosed low pressure flow cell we obtained measurements from 140 to 305 K at 20 to 200 Torr in Ar. Small kinetic modeling corrections were made for secondary regeneration of H atoms. The results are consistent with the current NASA JPL recommendation for this rate constant and establish its extrapolation down to the lower temperatures of the mesosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SRI International , 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yingdi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SRI International , 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SRI International , 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}], "LastName": "Reppert", "ForeName": "Kelsey", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SRI International , 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}], "LastName": "Callahan", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SRI International , 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Gregory P", "Initials": "GP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27193050", "10.1021/acs.jpca.6b02986"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
