Urbanization and industrialization over the past few decades have increased the air pollution. Plausible connections have been made between air pollutants and dementia. This study used machine learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, random forest, gradient-boosted decision trees, eXtreme gradient boosting, and CatBoost) to investigate the association between cognitive impairment and air pollution. Data from the Taiwan Biobank and 75 air-pollution-monitoring stations in Taiwan were analyzed to determine individual levels of exposure to air pollutants. The pollutants examined were particulate matter with a diameter of \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone. The results revealed that the most strongly correlated with cognitive impairment were ozone, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and carbon monoxide levels with adjustment of educational level, age, and household income. The model based on these factors achieved accuracy as high as 0.97 for detecting cognitive impairment, indicating a positive association between air pollutions and cognitive impairment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
