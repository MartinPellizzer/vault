A field campaign was conducted in the southwestern Pennsylvania region of the Marcellus Shale to investigate the impact of unconventional natural gas (UNG) production operations on regional air quality. Whole air samples were collected throughout an 8050 km(2) grid surrounding Pittsburgh and analyzed for methane, carbon dioxide, and C1-C10 volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Elevated mixing ratios of methane and C2-C8 alkanes were observed in areas with the highest density of UNG wells. Source apportionment was used to identify characteristic emission ratios for UNG sources, and results indicated that UNG emissions were responsible for the majority of mixing ratios of C2-C8 alkanes, but accounted for a small proportion of alkene and aromatic compounds. The VOC emissions from UNG operations accounted for 17 \u00b1 19% of the regional kinetic hydroxyl radical reactivity of nonbiogenic VOCs suggesting that natural gas emissions may affect compliance with federal ozone standards. A first approximation of methane emissions from the study area of 10.0 \u00b1 5.2 kg s(-1) provides a baseline for determining the efficacy of regulatory emission control efforts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Resources and Earth System Science Program, University of New Hampshire , Durham, New Hampshire 03824, United States."}], "LastName": "Swarthout", "ForeName": "Robert F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Russo", "ForeName": "Rachel S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "Brandon M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "Brittney", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Horsman", "ForeName": "Emily", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lipsky", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McCabe", "ForeName": "David C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baum", "ForeName": "Ellen", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sive", "ForeName": "Barkley C", "Initials": "BC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Natural Gas"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Natural Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Fields"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pennsylvania"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25594231", "10.1021/es504315f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
