Triggering of cardiac arrhythmia by changes in air quality could theoretically predispose individuals to cardiac arrest or heart failure, or stroke through precipitation of atrial fibrillation. We investigated the association between air quality and cardiac rate and rhythm characteristics measured by ambulatory cardiac monitoring.", "Daily ambient 3-h maximum concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, and an index summarizing these pollutants called the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) were compared to the results of 24-h ambulatory cardiac monitoring performed for clinical purposes in 8662 patients and analyzed at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Canada, between 2004 and 2009. An interquartile increase in the daily 3 h- maximum AQHI was associated with a 0.9% (95% CI 0.3%, 1.5%) increase in the daily maximum heart rate and a 1.17% (95% CI 1.07%, 1.29%) increase in heart block frequency. An interquartile increase in NO2 was associated with an increase in the percentage of time in atrial fibrillation of 4.39% (-0.15, 9.15) among those \u226450 years old, and 7.1% (0.24, 14.5) among males.", "We found evidence that air pollution may affect cardiac rate and rhythm. This may be one mechanism partially explaining the increase in strokes and cardiac events observed on days of higher air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2014.
