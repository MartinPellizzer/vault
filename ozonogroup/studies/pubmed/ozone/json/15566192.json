These reactions involve the very reactive and catalytic intermediates O2- radical, OH radical, HO2 radical, OH-, H2O2, etc. OH radical is proposed as an important factor in the ozonation of water among them. In the present study, the enhancing effects of several phenolic compounds; phenol, 2-, 3-, 4-monochloro, 2,4-dichloro, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol on OH radical generation were mathematically evaluated using the electron spin resonance (ESR)/spin-trapping technique. OH radical was trapped with a 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a stable adduct, DMPO-OH. The initial velocities of DMPO-OH generation in ozonated water containing phenolic compounds were quantitatively measured using a combined system of ESR spectroscopy with stopped-flow apparatus, which was controlled by homemade software. The initial velocities of DMPO-OH generation increased as a function of the ozone concentration. The relation among ozone concentration, amount of phenolic compounds and the initial velocity (v0) of DMPO-OH generation was mathematically analyzed and the following equation was obtained, v0 (10(-6) M/s) = (A' x [PhOHs (10(-9) M)] + 0.0005) exp (60 x [ozone (10(-9) M)]). The equation fitted very well with the experimental results, and the correlation coefficient was larger than 0.98."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio-function Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi, Fukuoka, Japan. hyh@pch.phar.kyushu-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ichikawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Utsumi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15566192"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
