Identification of transformation products formed during the ozonation of micropollutants is challenging due to several factors including (i) the reactions of both oxidants, ozone and hydroxyl radicals with the micropollutants, as well as with intermediate transformation products, (ii) effects of the water matrix on the ozone and hydroxyl radical chemistry and (iii) the generation of oxidation by-products. In this study, a simple approach to achieve realistic ozonation conditions in the absence of dissolved organic matter has been developed. It is based on composing synthetic water matrices with low-molecular-weight scavenger compounds (phenol, methanol, acetate, and carbonate) that mimic the chemical interactions of ozone and hydroxyl radicals with real water matrices. Synthetic waters composed of only four low-molecular-weight compounds successfully replicated two lake waters and two secondary wastewater effluents, matching instantaneous ozone demand, ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures in the initial phase, as well as the ozone evolution in the second phase of the ozonation process. The synthetic water matrices also reproduced the effects of temperature and pH changes observed in real waters. The abatement of two micropollutants, bezafibrate and atrazine, and the formation of the corresponding transformation products during ozonation were in agreement for synthetic and real waters. Furthermore, the kinetics and extent of bromate formation during ozonation in synthetic water were comparable to real lake water and wastewater. This supports the robustness of the proposed approach because bromate formation is very sensitive to the interplay of ozone and hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, with the novel reaction system, a significant effect of hydroxyl radicals scavenging by carbonate on bromate formation was demonstrated. Overall, the herein-developed approach based on synthetic water matrices allows to perform realistic ozonation studies including both oxidants, ozone and hydroxyl radicals, without the constraints of using dissolved organic matter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
