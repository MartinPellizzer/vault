The formation of these compounds is thought to be related to oxidative stress, involving H2O2 and algal peroxidases. In our study we found strong correlations between the releases of H2O2 and brominated and some iodinated compounds to the seawater medium, but no such correlation was found for CHCl3, suggesting the involvement of other formation mechanisms as well. Little is known about the effects of environmental factors on the production of volatile halocarbons by algae and in the present study we focused on the influence of temperature. Algae were sampled in an area of the brackish Baltic Sea that receives thermal discharge, allowing us to collect specimens of the same species that were adapted to different field temperature regimes. We exposed six algal species (the diatom Pleurosira laevis, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus and four filamentous green algae, Cladophora glomerata, Enteromorpha ahlneriana, E. flexuosa and E. intestinalis) to temperature changes of 0-11 degrees C under high irradiation to invoke oxidative stress. The production rates, as well as the quantitative composition of 16 volatile halocarbons, were strongly species-dependent and different types of responses to temperature were recorded. However, no response patterns to temperature change were found that were consistent for all species or for all halocarbons. We conclude that the production of certain halocarbons may increase with temperature in certain algal species, but that the amount and composition of the volatile halocarbons released by algal communities are probably more affected by temperature-associated species shifts. These results may have implications for climatic change scenarios."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical and Marine Chemistry, Chalmers University of Technology, SE-41296, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abrahamsson", "ForeName": "Katarina", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choo", "ForeName": "Kyung Sil", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peders\u00e9n", "ForeName": "Marianne", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johansson", "ForeName": "Gustav", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Snoeijs", "ForeName": "Pauli", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryota"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["13679095", "10.1016/s0031-9422(03)00419-9", "S0031942203004199"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
