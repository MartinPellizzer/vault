The pollution characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors and the sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> generation to its precursors were also analyzed based on the characteristic ratio method and a photochemical model. The results indicated that Taian City was suffering from serious O<sub>3</sub> pollution during the observation period. The daily variation of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration exhibited an obvious convex trend with the highest value at approximately 15:00, whereas the concentrations of nitrogen oxide (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) and VOCs had decreasing trends during the daytime and increasing trends during the night. It was concluded from the results of the characteristic ratio methods (OPE, VOCs/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><i>z</i></sub>) and the empirical kinetics modeling approach (EKMA) curve method that the photochemical generation of O<sub>3</sub> in Taian was controlled by the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> concentration and the transition area, which means that reducing the emissions of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs has a controlling effect on O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Additionally, the results of the EKMA curve method also showed that the best effect of O<sub>3</sub> concentration control could be achieved by reducing the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> precursors, and reducing the concentrations of VOCs (propylene equivalent, PE) and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> according to a PE:NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> concentration ratio of 8:3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Monitoring Center for Ecological Environment of Taian, Taian 271000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Monitoring Center for Ecological Environment of Taian, Taian 271000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Monitoring Center for Ecological Environment of Taian, Taian 271000, China."}], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Ru-Bo", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33124326", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201912046"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
