Here, we prepared a series of transitional metal (Co, Mn, Ni) single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored on graphitic carbon nitride to accelerate ozone decomposition and produce highly reactive \u00b7OH for oxidative destruction of a water pollutant, oxalic acid (OA). We experimentally observed that, depending on the metal type, OA oxidation occurred dominantly either in the bulk phase, which was the case for the Mn catalyst, or via a combination of the bulk phase and surface reaction, which was the case for the Co catalyst. We further performed density functional theory simulations and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to propose that the ozone activation pathway differs depending on the oxygen binding energy of metal, primarily due to differential adsorption of O<sub>3</sub> onto metal sites and differential coordination configuration of a key intermediate species, *OO, which is collectively responsible for the observed differences in oxidation mechanisms and kinetics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Data
