Using a method to rank air quality established by the American Lung Association in its 2009 State of the Air report along with EPA air quality data, we assess the environmental justice dimensions of air pollution exposure and access to air quality information in the United States. We focus on the race, age, and poverty demographics of communities with differing levels of ozone and particulate matter exposure, as well as communities with and without air quality information. Focusing on PM2.5 and ozone, we find that within areas covered by the monitoring networks, non-Hispanic blacks are consistently overrepresented in communities with the poorest air quality. The results for older and younger age as well as poverty vary by the pollution metric under consideration. Rural areas are typically outside the bounds of air quality monitoring networks leaving large segments of the population without information about their ambient air quality. These results suggest that substantial areas of the United States lack monitoring data, and among areas where monitoring data are available, low income and minority communities tend to experience higher ambient pollution levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Children's Environmental Health Initiative, Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708, USA. mmiranda@duke.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miranda", "ForeName": "Marie Lynn", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "Sharon E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keating", "ForeName": "Martha H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES011961", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "5P30-ES-011961-04", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101238455", "ISSNLinking": "1660-4601"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Access to Information"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poverty Areas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Racial Groups"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "40 CFR Part 50 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter.
