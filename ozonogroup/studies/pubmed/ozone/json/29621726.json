While there has been a notable progress in understanding O<sub>3</sub> effects on vegetation, O<sub>3</sub> effects on ecological stoichiometry remain unclear, especially early in the oxidative stress. Ethyelenediurea (EDU) is a chemical compound widely applied in research projects as protectant of plants against O<sub>3</sub> injury, however its mode of action remains unclear. To investigate O<sub>3</sub> and EDU effects early in the stress, we sprayed willow (Salix sachalinensis) plants with 0, 200 or 400\u202fmg EDU L<sup>-1</sup>, and exposed them to either low ambient O<sub>3</sub> (AOZ) or elevated O<sub>3</sub> (EOZ) levels during the daytime, for about one month, in a free air O<sub>3</sub> controlled exposure (FACE); EDU treatment was repeated every nine days. We collected samples for analyses from basal, top, and shed leaves, before leaves develop visible O<sub>3</sub> symptoms. We found that O<sub>3</sub> altered the ecological stoichiometry, including impacts in nutrient resorption efficiency, early in the stress. The relation between P content and Fe content seemed to have a critical role in maintaining homeostasis in an effort to prevent O<sub>3</sub>-induced damage. Photosynthetic pigments and P content appeared to play an important role in EDU mode of action. This study provides novel insights on the stress biology which are of ecological and toxicological importance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
