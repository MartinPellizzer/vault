Their reactions with ozone have been probed by calculating the standard Gibbs free energies of such reactions using density functional theory (Jaguar 7.6 program). O(2) reacts fast and irreversibly only with simple carbon-centered radicals. In contrast, ozone also reacts irreversibly with conjugated carbon-centered radicals such as bisallylic (hydroxycylohexadienyl) radicals, with conjugated carbon/oxygen-centered radicals such as phenoxyl radicals, and even with nitrogen- oxygen-, sulfur-, and halogen-centered radicals. In these reactions, further ozone-reactive radicals are generated. Chain reactions may destroy ozone without giving rise to products other than O(2). This may be of importance when ozonation is used in pollution control, and reactions of free radicals with ozone have to be taken into account in modeling such processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Oberfl\u00e4chenmodifizierung, Permoserstrasse 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany. sergej.naumov@iom-leipzig.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naumov", "ForeName": "Sergej", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Sonntag", "ForeName": "Clemens", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21910507", "10.1021/es2018658"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
