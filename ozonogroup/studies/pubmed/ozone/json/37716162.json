Therefore, ozone water may have clinical applications in treating staphylococcal-specific cutaneous diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and pyoderma. This study aimed to verify the bactericidal effects of ozone water at different concentrations (3 and 11\u00a0mg/L) against staphylococcal species in vitro, as well as evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of ozone water in a mouse model of AD and pyoderma. Initially, the bactericidal properties of several concentrations of ozone water were confirmed with Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius. Both 3 and 11\u00a0mg/L of ozone water exhibited a significant bactericidal effect against staphylococci at less than 100 times dilution. We next examined the cellular cytotoxicity and cytokine production (Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8) induced by S. pseudintermedius pre-treated with ozone water, and our findings indicated that cytotoxicity and cytokine production induced by staphylococci were significantly inhibited after ozone water pre-treatment. In vivo experiments showed that ozone water-pre-treated S. pseudintermedius significantly inhibited the development of pyoderma in mice; however, limited effects were observed in a therapeutic setting. Interestingly, ozone water at concentrations of 3 and 11\u00a0mg/L exhibits dual bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects in mice with AD. This observation was corroborated by the significant inhibition of cytokine production in interferon-\u03b3/tumor necrosis factor-stimulated human epidermal keratinocyte cells exposed to ozone in vitro. These findings indicate that administering ozone can be a novel therapeutic approach for managing allergic skin diseases, such as AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
