Specifically, the article identifies and describes existing reactivity data for volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from consumer and commercial products (CCF), and methods for developing control strategies for such emissions that take into account emissions reactivities. Existing reactivity data consist of Incremental Reactivity data and KOH-reactivity data. Both types of data are subject to uncertainties associated with \u2022 lack of experimental evidence, which is particularly severe for CCP emissions species; \u2022 theoretical derivation and/or experimental measurement of reactivity; and \u2022 variation of VOC reactivity with ambient conditions. Methods are described for using the reactivity concept to estimate the contribution of CCP emissions to ambient ozone. Also, to comply with one of the requirements of Section 183(e) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and with current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency policy on reactivity, existing reactivity data were used to classify VOCs into three reactivity classes: \"negligibly reactive\"; \"reactive\", and \"highly reactive\"."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , North Carolin , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dimitriades", "ForeName": "Basil", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28065145", "10.1080/10473289.1996.10467531"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
