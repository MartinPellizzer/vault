In male mice (9-13 wk), a tracheostomy was made under pentobarbital anesthesia for spontaneous breathing and tracheal potential was measured in the cephalad portion of the bisected trachea using Hanks' salt/agar-capped KCl bridges connected to a pair of calomel half cells. The mean tracheal potentials of five different strains of mice (C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and 129/J) were approximately 10 mV (lumen negative) with no significant interstrain difference. Amiloride reduced mouse tracheal potentials by approximately 70% in both C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J mice, indicating that sodium absorption is the predominant ion transport across this tissue. Relative to air-exposed controls, acute ozone exposure (2 ppm for 3 h) significantly attenuated tracheal potential of inflammation-susceptible C57BL/6J mice by approximately 50% at 6 h and 40% at 24 h postexposure but had no effect immediately after exposure. The mean tracheal potential of C3H/HeJ mice was not changed by ozone. The differential effect of acute ozone exposure on tracheal potential in C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice is consistent with differential susceptibility to ozone-induced increases in epithelial permeability in these strains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21205."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleeberger", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Croxton", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DK-42786", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-03505", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7DZO8EB0Z3", "NameOfSubstance": "Amiloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amiloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophysiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8338179", "10.1152/ajplung.1993.265.1.L33"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
