This study aims to quantify the association between short-term air pollution exposure and respiratory hospital admissions among children in Hanoi, Vietnam, and estimate the population-attributable burden using local data. A case-crossover analysis was conducted based on the individual records where each case is their own control. The health data was obtained from 13 hospitals in Hanoi and air pollution data was collected from four monitoring stations from 2007 to 2019. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate Percentage Change (PC) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in odd of hospital admissions per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in daily average particulate matter (e.g. PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>), Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), 8-h maximum Ozone and per 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in daily mean of Carbon Monoxide (CO). We also calculated the number and fraction of admissions attributed to air pollution in Hanoi by using the coefficient at lag 0. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the concentration of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>1</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> 8-h maximum and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in CO concentration was associated with 0.6%, 1.2%, 1.4%, 0.8%, 1.6%, 0.3%, and 1.7% increase in odd of admission for all respiratory diseases among children under 16 years at lag 0-2. All PM metrics and NO<sub>2</sub> are associated with childhood admission for pneumonia and bronchitis. Admissions due to asthma and upper respiratory diseases are related to increments in NO<sub>2</sub> and CO. For attributable cases, PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Hanoi exceeding the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines accounted for 1619 respiratory hospital admissions in Hanoi children in 2019. Our findings show that air pollution has a detrimental impact on the respiratory health of Hanoi children and there will be important health benefits from improved air quality management planning to reduce air pollution in Vietnam."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
