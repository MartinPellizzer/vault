In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model and Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) were used to simulate atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Beijing. To investigate the formation mechanisms and source contributions of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in different regions of Beijing, process analysis and the integrated source apportionment method within the CMAQ were applied to O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the summer of 2018. The process analysis results showed that vertical diffusion was the major contributor to O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at all receptor sites in Beijing, at > 65.94\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7hr). Gas-phase chemical reactions consumed a significant amount of O<sub>3</sub> in urban and inner suburban areas (> -5.57\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7hr)), while near-surface chemical reactions made positive contributions in outer suburban areas (> 4.72\u00a0\u00b5g/(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7hr)). The O<sub>3</sub> formation chemical reactions indicated that NO titration, which removes O<sub>3</sub> at night-time, mainly occurred in urban areas. The weaker chemical reactions occurring near the surface in outer suburbs suggested that suburban-area O<sub>3</sub> was produced in the upper atmospheric layers and was transported vertically to the lower layers. The O<sub>3</sub> source apportionment results showed that boundary contributions were the dominant contributor to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Beijing (> 40%). The contribution of non-local emissions to O<sub>3</sub> levels was significantly greater in the outer suburbs than in urban and inner suburban areas due to topography. This study increases the understanding of the complex processes of O<sub>3</sub> formation in different areas of Beijing and informs the implementation of O<sub>3</sub> control plans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
