An approach that can apportion the contributions of primary sources and reactions to the consumed VOCs was developed in this study and applied to hourly VOCs data from June to August 2022 measured in Shijiazhuang, China. The results showed that petrochemical industries (36.9\u00a0% and 51.7\u00a0%) and oxidation formation (20.6\u00a0% and 35.6\u00a0%) provided the largest contributions to consumed VOCs and OVOCs during the study period, whereas natural gas (5.0\u00a0% and 7.6\u00a0%) and the mixed source of liquefied petroleum gas and solvent use (3.1\u00a0% and 4.2\u00a0%) had the relatively low contributions. Compared to the non-O<sub>3</sub> pollution (NOP) period, the contributions of oxidation formation, petrochemical industries, and the mixed source of gas evaporation and vehicle emissions to the consumed VOCs during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution (OP) period increased by 2.8, 3.8, and 9.3 times, respectively. The differences in contributions of liquified petroleum gas and solvent use, natural gas, and combustion sources to consumed VOCs between OP and NOP periods were relatively small. Transport of petrochemical industries emissions from the southeast to the study site was the primary consumed pathway for VOCs emitted from petrochemical industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
