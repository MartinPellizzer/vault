Studies in the USA have reported adverse effects on lung function among children but no comparable studies have been published in the UK. This study investigates the relationship between daily changes in ambient air pollution and short term variations in lung function in a panel of school children.", "One hundred and fifty four children aged 7-11 attending a primary school adjacent to a major motorway in Surrey, south-east England, were studied. Bellows spirometry was performed daily on 31 schooldays between 6 June and 21 July 1994. Levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulates of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) were measured continuously at the school and the pollen count was measured six miles away. Relationships between daily changes in forced expiratory volume in 0.75 seconds (FEV0.75), forced vital capacity (FVC), the FEV0.75/FVC ratio and pollutants were analysed using separate autoregressive models for each child. A weighted average of the resulting slopes was then calculated.", "There was a significant inverse relationship between daily mean PM10 levels lagged one day and FVC, with a reduction in lung function of 1% (95% CI 0.3% to 2%) across the whole range of PM10 levels (20-150 micrograms/m3). The effect on FEV0.75 was similar (-0.5%) but was not significant when weighted by 1/SE2 (95% CI -1.2% to 0.2%). There was no effect of PM10 levels on the FEV0.75/FVC ratio. No significant association was seen between FEV0.75, FVC, or the FEV0.75/FVC ratio and either ozone or nitrogen dioxide levels. There was no evidence that wheezy children were more affected than healthy children. Pollen levels on the previous day had no effect on lung function and did not change the air pollution results.", "There is a very small, but statistically significant, adverse effect of airborne respirable particulate matter, measured as PM10, on lung function in this study group. There is no evidence for an inverse association of lung function with levels of ozone or NO2 measured on the previous day."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, St George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scarlett", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abbott", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peacock", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Strachan", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Thorax", "NlmUniqueID": "0417353", "ISSNLinking": "0040-6376"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Am J Public Health. 1980 Jul;70(7):687-96", "ArticleIdList": ["7386702"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1988 Mar-Apr;43(2):168-73", "ArticleIdList": ["3377551"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1991 Jan;4(1):72-81", "ArticleIdList": ["1846079"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1991 May-Jun;46(3):145-50", "ArticleIdList": ["2039268"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1992 Jan;145(1):42-7", "ArticleIdList": ["1731597"]}, {"Citation": "Stat Med. 1993 Jan 15;12(1):27-37", "ArticleIdList": ["8446801"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1995 Sep;50(9):948-54", "ArticleIdList": ["8539674"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1994 Jan;64(1):36-52", "ArticleIdList": ["8287841"]}, {"Citation": "Eur Respir J. 1993 Nov;6(10):1455-61", "ArticleIdList": ["8112438"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1994 Feb;49(2):133-40", "ArticleIdList": ["8128402"]}, {"Citation": "Annu Rev Public Health. 1994;15:107-32", "ArticleIdList": ["8054077"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1995 Feb;50(2):149-55", "ArticleIdList": ["7701453"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1993 Jan-Feb;48(1):27-32", "ArticleIdList": ["8452396"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8958894", "PMC1090522", "10.1136/thx.51.11.1109"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
