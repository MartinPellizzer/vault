Experimental results showed that the degradation effect of m-cresol with an initial concentration of 50\u00a0mg/L was 99.8% in 30\u00a0min under the optimization conditions. The reaction kinetic model in the UV/O<sub>3</sub>-Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> system shows that the initial pH value, the respective ozone, and the persulfate dosage were positively correlated with the degradation rate constant value (k). The apparent degradation rate of m-cresol in the UV/O<sub>3</sub>-Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> system was 0.2216\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>, and the synergy factor (f) was larger than 1, thereby demonstrating a synergistic effect of UV, ozone, and persulfate. The dominant free radicals in the system were sulfate radical (SO- 4\u00b7) and hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH), and the contribution ratio of SO- 4\u00b7 to m-cresol degradation was higher than \u00b7OH. The degradation process of m-cresol by UV/O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0-\u00a0Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> was mainly through the electrophilic addition reaction to substitute the ortho- and para-positions of the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring, followed by the ring-opening reaction and mineralization of the aliphatic compound to achieve the complete degradation of m-cresol."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
