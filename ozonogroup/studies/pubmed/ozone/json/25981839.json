Surgery was performed under general anesthesia to create a critical-size bone defect (5\u00a0mm in diameter) in the cranium. After sacrifice, microtomographic images of all samples were recorded, and histomorphometric analysis was performed.", "Histologic and radiologic measurements showed that the values of all experimental groups were higher than those of the control group. Histologic scores for all experimental groups were statistically higher than those for the control group day 30 (O, P\u00a0= .045; HBO, P\u00a0= .049; HBO-O, P\u00a0= .042). Histologic scores also were statistically higher for the HBO group on day 5 (P\u00a0= .045) and day 15 (P\u00a0= .009) compared with the control group. Microtomographic scores were higher for the experimental groups than for the control group, with statistically significant differences for group O on day 5 (P\u00a0= .033) and day 30 (P\u00a0= .0045) and for group HBO on day 15 (P\u00a0= .005).
