Measurements were made from a capsule which reached 175 km. The attitude was controlled during the whole flight by means of agyroscopic device. Seven spectral channels were studied, especially: ozone (9.6 micro), CO(2) (14-16 micro), the range of atmospheric window (11micro), and a broad channel (1-50 micro) that was the only one of the firstexperiment in 1965. The spatial limit of resolution is 0.16 degrees , and theattitude in space of the capsule has been reconstructed with an accuracy equalto 0.05 degrees due to a star mapper. Results are expressed as variations ofradiance with respect to tangential height for the different spectral channels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Girard", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lemaitre", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20076301", "10.1364/AO.9.000903", "16318"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
