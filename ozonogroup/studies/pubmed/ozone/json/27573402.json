The concentration of the target compounds is generally very low as compared to the concentration of such natural 'impurities' as chloride and carbonate/bicarbonate ions or the dissolved humic substances (generally referred to as dissolved organic carbon), which consume the majority of the hydroxyl radicals. The different constituents compete for reacting with radicals initiating the degradation. This manuscript discusses the radiation chemistry of this complex system. It includes the reactions of the primary water radiolysis intermediates (hydroxyl radical, hydrated electron/hydrogen atom), the reactions of radicals that form in radical transfer reactions (dichloride-, carbonate- and sulfate radical anions) and also the contribution to the degradation of organic compounds of such additives as hydrogen peroxide, ozone or persulfate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy Security and Environmental Safety, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Konkoly-Thege M. \u00fat. 29-33, H-1121, Budapest, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Wojn\u00e1rovits", "ForeName": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy Security and Environmental Safety, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Konkoly-Thege M. \u00fat. 29-33, H-1121, Budapest, Hungary. erzsebet.takacs@energia.mta.hu."}], "LastName": "Tak\u00e1cs", "ForeName": "Erzs\u00e9bet", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Top Curr Chem (Cham)", "NlmUniqueID": "101691301", "ISSNLinking": "2364-8961"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27573402", "10.1007/s41061-016-0050-2", "10.1007/s41061-016-0050-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
