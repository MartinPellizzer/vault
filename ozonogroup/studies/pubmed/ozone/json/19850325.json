Mean two-year (February 2007 through January 2009) GEM, GOM, and PBM concentrations were 2.0+/-0.7 ng m(-3) (+/-standard deviation), 18+/-22 pg m(-3), and 7+/-7 pg m(-3), respectively. Data collected were compared with observations made at another location just north of the city at 169 m higher elevation. At both locations higher concentrations of GEM and PBM occurred in periods with little atmospheric mixing, indicating that local sources were important for enhancing GEM and PBM concentrations in Reno above that considered continental background. Concentrations of GOM were higher (maximum of 177 pg m(-3)) during periods with higher temperature and lower dew point. Higher GOM concentrations at the higher elevation site with less urban impact relative to the valley site, along with other data trends, support the hypothesis that in northern Nevada subsiding dry air from the free troposphere is a source of GOM to the surface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Natural Resources, 1664 North Virginia Street, Reno, Nevada 89557, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lyman", "ForeName": "Seth N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gustin", "ForeName": "Mae Sexauer", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nevada"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19850325", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.045", "S0048-9697(09)00908-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
