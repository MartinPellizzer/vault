This study evaluated assimilable organic carbon (AOC), which is a part of the biodegradable organic matter promoting microbial growth, in water reclamation systems in Japan. The AOC concentration in the reclaimed water from various treatment processes ranged between 36 and 446 \u03bcg C/L (median 316 \u03bcg C/L). The AOC concentration in the reclaimed water from the plants equipped with ozonation was significantly higher - more than two times - than that in the reclaimed water from plants equipped with other processes. UV and chlorine also changed the AOC concentration slightly. Moreover, reverse osmosis produced reclaimed water with the lowest AOC content. Processes equipped with membrane filtration were effective in removing seed microorganisms that enter the distribution system. Microbial growth in reclaimed water distribution systems occurred when the total and free residual chlorine was lower than 0.36 and 0.09 mg/L, respectively. The AOC reduction occurred simultaneously with regrowth, which suggests that AOC could support microbial growth in reclaimed-water-distribution systems. As the residual chlorine is often depleted during distribution and storage, it is essential to control the AOC to suppress microbial growth."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
