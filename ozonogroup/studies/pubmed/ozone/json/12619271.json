The effect of the inlet concentration, air flow rate and humidity on the degradation efficiency and removal load was investigated. Then the efficiency of combined ozone and photocatalysis was compared with that of photocatalysis. The experiment results indicated that combination of ozone and photocatalysis was far more efficient than photocatalysis in degrading toluene, especially under high-level inlet concentration. When the inlet concentration was in the range of 10-40 mg/m3, the degradation efficiency of combined ozone and photocatalysis was over 90% and dropped linearly and very slowly with the increase of inlet concentration of toluene. The degradation efficiency of combined ozone and photocatalysis was slightly affected by humidity with the efficiency difference less than 2.5%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. liangfuyan00@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Fuyan", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pengyi", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12619271"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
