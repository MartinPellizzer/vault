In this study, we fabricated alginate hydrogels cross-linked by divalent cations on wettability-patterned substrates by alternate soaking of precursor solutions of sodium alginate and divalent cations. The wettability-patterned substrates were fabricated on hydrophilic glass plates modified with hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers of hexamethyldisilazane followed by exposure to an ultraviolet/ozone atmosphere through a metal mask. The film thickness of alginate gels with a width and length of 0.1 and 4 mm were tuned stepwise from 30 nm to 200 nm by adjusting the precursor conditions, including the pH, type of divalent metal ions, and sodium alginate concentration, and the alternate soaking conditions, including the dipping/withdrawal speed and number of alternate soaking cycles. This technique can be applied to other functional gels and will contribute to fabrication of hydrogel devices at the micro- and nanometer scales in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Kumamoto University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tominaga", "ForeName": "Taiga", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "Mutsuyoshi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alginates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Alkaline Earth"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alginates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glass"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Alkaline Earth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wettability"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30542009", "10.5650/jos.ess18166"]}}]}
