Photodegradation processes in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ozone (O3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) are most frequently offered for wastewater treatment. The novel gas-sparged reactor equipped with UV lamp proved to be an efficient system for photochemical degradation. In this investigation 80 ppm aqueous solution of phenol was treated for 40 minutes. 13% of phenol was eliminated in the UV/air system and 73% in the UV/H2 O2/air system at 80 l/min air flowrate. Air sparging did not result in phenol removal with the gas phase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Technology, Chemical Faculty, Technical University of Gda\u0144sk, Poland. ewwlasza@chem.pg.gda.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Artuna", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hupka", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Cent Eur J Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9417324", "ISSNLinking": "1210-7778"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10943487"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
