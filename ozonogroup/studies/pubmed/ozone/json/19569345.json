The degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene is determined by the initiation of hydroxyl radical (*OH) according to a good linear correlation in all the processes of modified ceramic honeycomb catalytic ozonation at the different loading percentages of metals. The modification of ceramic honeycomb with metals results in the conversion of the pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc) and the evolution of surface groups. Divergence from the conventional phenomenon, the enhancement mechanism of ozone decomposition on the modified ceramic honeycomb with metals is proposed due to the basic attractive forces of electrostatic forces or/and hydrogen bonding. Consequently, a novel relationship between the initiation of *OH and the surface-OH2+ group on the modified catalyst is established based on the synergetic effect between homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, People's Republic of China. zhaolei999999@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhizhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19569345", "10.1021/es900084w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
