Raman characterizations provide evidence that ozone-induced autoxidation, in addition to direct ozonolysis, is a plausible pathway in the reactions between ozone and linoleic acid and linolenic acid particles. Furthermore, the significance of this specific oxidation pathway depends on the ozone concentrations used in the experiment. A low ozone concentration (approximately 200-250 ppb) with a longer exposure period (20 h) favors autoxidation but an extremely high ozone concentration (approximately 10 ppm) favors ozonolysis and forces most unsaturated fatty acids to react with ozone in a relatively short period of time. In the low ozone concentration experiments, the mass of the ozone-processed linoleic acid and linolenic acid particles increased by about 2-3% and 10-13%, respectively. In addition, the mass ratios (particle mass at RH approximately 85% to particle mass at RH<5%) of the ozone-processed linoleic acid and linolenic acid particles increased by about 2-3% and 3-4%, respectively. The morphology of the pure and ozone-processed linoleic acid and linolenic acid particles are compared, based on imagining and their light scattering patterns."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Alex K Y", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Chak K", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17585848", "10.1021/jp071812l"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
