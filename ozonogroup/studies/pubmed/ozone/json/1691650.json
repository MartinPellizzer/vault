At this time the leading candidate appears to be methanol. In anticipation of a shift to methanol, flexible-fueled automobiles capable of operating on gasoline and/or methanol are being developed. This study examines both the exhaust and evaporative emissions from a prototype General Motors Variable Fuel Corsica. Results are reported for tests conducted at temperatures of 40 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees F, and for fuels M0 M25, M50, M85, and M100. In addition to regulated emissions and fuel economy, emission rates for methanol, aldehydes, and a large number of hydrocarbon compounds were measured. The data indicate that increasing the fuel's methanol content does not affect the exhaust organic emission rate (calculated in accordance with the regulation) from flexible-fueled cars, but formaldehyde and methanol comprise increasingly greater portions of the organic material while hydrocarbons comprise less. Increasing fuel methanol content has no significant effect on exhaust regulated emission rates (organic material, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides) nor on the composition of total hydrocarbons, except for methane, which increases substantially. The effect of ambient temperature on both exhaust and evaporative emissions is similar to its effect on gasoline cars: organic and carbon monoxide exhaust emissions increase substantially at the lower temperatures, and evaporative emissions increase steadily with increases in temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gabele", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manage Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9002202", "ISSNLinking": "1047-3289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1691650", "10.1080/10473289.1990.10466685"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
