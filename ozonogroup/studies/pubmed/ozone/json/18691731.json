The treatment was conducted in a semi-batch reactor under different experimental conditions by varying ozone gas dosage and incident UV light intensity. The groundwater samples contained BTEX compounds, MTBE, TBA, and TPHg in the ranges of 5-10000, 3000-5500, 80-1400, and 2400-20000 microgl(-1), respectively. The ozone/UV process was very effective compared to ozonation in the removal of the gasoline components from the groundwater samples. For the various gasoline constituents, more than 99% removal efficiency was achieved for the ozone/UV process and the removal efficiency for ozonation was as low as 27%. The net ozone consumed per mol of organic carbon (from BTEX, MTBE, and TBA) oxidized varied in the range of 5-60 for different types of groundwater samples treated by the ozone/UV process. In ozonation experiments, it was observed that the presence of sufficient amount of iron in groundwater samples improved the removal of BTEX, MTBE, TBA, and TPHg."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Drive, San Diego, CA 92182, United States. tgaroma@mail.sdsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garoma", "ForeName": "Temesgen", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurol", "ForeName": "Mirat D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osibodu", "ForeName": "Olufisayo", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thotakura", "ForeName": "Lalitha", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29I4YB3S89", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl tert-butyl ether"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L5I45M5G0O", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylbenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MD83SFE959", "NameOfSubstance": "tert-Butyl Alcohol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "tert-Butyl Alcohol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18691731", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.06.061", "S0045-6535(08)00859-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
