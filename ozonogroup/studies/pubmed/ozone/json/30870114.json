While seasonal variation associated with suicide was reported to occur and that in the spring and early summer there are peaks in ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) distribution, the relationship between these two parameters is not known. The aim of this study was to examine the potential association between O<sub>3</sub> levels and daily mortality rate related to suicide in Taipei for the period 2004-2008 using a time-stratified case-crossover analysis. In our single pollutant model without adjustment for other pollutants, the risk of suicide increased by 11% on warm days and 15% on cool days for each interquartile range (IQR) rise in O<sub>3</sub> concentration, respectively. The relationship was positive but did not reach significance. In our two-pollutant models, O<sub>3</sub> remained non-significant on warm days after inclusion of one of any other ambient air contaminants into the model. However, on cool days, a significant association was found between O<sub>3</sub> levels and enhanced risk of mortality due to suicide after nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO) were included. The overall positive but not significant findings of elevated risk of mortality frequently attributed to suicide on days with higher O<sub>3</sub> levels suggest that outdoor exposures to this gaseous contaminant may contribute to increases in daily mortality rate related to suicide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Health Research Institute , Miaoli , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Chang Gung University College of Medicine , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Yi-Hao", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Master Program in Global Health and Development, College of Public Health and Nutrition , Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Ya-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cause of Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Suicide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30870114", "10.1080/15287394.2019.1589109"]}}]}
