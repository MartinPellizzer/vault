The effects of experimental parameters including applied voltage, flow rate, initial chlorobenzene concentration, and their interactions on the chlorobenzene degradation performance were investigated by the response surface methodology integrated with a central composite design. Results indicated that applied voltage was the most significant parameter affecting the mineralization rate and the concentration of ozone generated, while energy yield was mainly determined by initial chlorobenzene concentration. As a key precursor of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorophenols were found during the identification of the intermediates produced during chlorobenzene degradation through GC-MS. Furthermore, HRGC-HRMS was used to detect the remaining byproducts on the catalyst surface after 3 and 10\u00a0h discharge time, and three types of PCDD/Fs (2,3,7,8-TCDF, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HCDF and OCDD) were detected after 10\u00a0h of discharge. The degradation mechanism of chlorobenzene was analyzed based on these detected intermediates, and the possible formation mechanisms of the three PCDD/Fs were proposed for the first time in plasma catalytic degradation of chlorobenzene."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
