C57BL/6J mice were exposed to air or 2 ppm O3 for 3 h and killed immediately or 3, 6, 9, or 21 h after exposure. Expression of ICAM-1 was examined by immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections. PMN influx was evaluated by lavage and by histochemical staining of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and measurement of tissue MPO activity. ICAM-1 expression exhibited regional selectivity and temporal patterns that were unique to each region. Upregulation of ICAM-1 expression on the epithelial cells in the trachea, and to a lesser extent in the lobar and segmental bronchi, was observed 3-9 h after exposure and remained present at 21 h. Enhanced ICAM-1 expression in bronchioles and terminal bronchiole/alveolar duct regions was evident earlier (immediately to 3 h after exposure) but returned to baseline levels by 21 and 9 h, respectively. Maximal ICAM-1 expression and PMN influx in the lung parenchyma were concurrently observed at 3 h, followed by transepithelial migration of PMNs to the airway lumen. These results demonstrate regional variations in airway inflammatory activity and are supportive of the notion that upregulation of ICAM-1 on the airway epithelium may play a role in local regulation of PMN influx to the airways after acute O3 exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schofield", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleeberger", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scott", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hasegawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spannhake", "ForeName": "E W", "Initials": "EW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03505", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-30195", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8594038", "10.1152/jappl.1995.79.5.1753"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
