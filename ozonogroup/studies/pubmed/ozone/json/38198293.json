On average, NO<sub>x</sub> was also enhanced on days with smoke, but this was complicated by day of week effects.Photochemical modeling of O<sub>3</sub> production rates at the Utah Tech Center demonstrates a strong sensitivity to VOC concentrations and less sensitivity to NOx. For non-smoke days, achieving the current O<sub>3</sub> standard would require regional reductions in VOCs of\u2009~40% or reductions in NO<sub>x</sub>\u2009~\u200960%.The photochemical modeling shows that formaldehyde and other OVOCs, along with alkenes, were the most important O<sub>3</sub> precursors.Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) gave similar MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> enhancements on smoky days as the photochemical modeling. Analysis of the GAM results show that 23% of the smoke days have GAM residuals that exceed the U.S. EPA\u2019s criteria for inclusion as exceptional event documentation."]}], "GeneralNote": [], "PMID": "38198293", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "2024", "Month": "02", "Day": "27"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2024", "Month": "04", "Day": "30"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "02", "Day": "05"}], "ELocationID": ["10.1080/10962247.2024.2301956"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "2162-2906", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "74", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "2024", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc"}, "ArticleTitle": "Key results from the salt lake regional smoke, ozone, and aerosol study (SAMOZA).", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "163", "EndPage": "180", "MedlinePgn": "163-180"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The Northern Wasatch Front area is one of\u2009~\u200950 metropolitan regions in the U.S. that do not meet the 2015 O<sub>3</sub> standard.

The primary goals of SAMOZA were: Measure a suite of VOCs, by Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) cartridge method.Evaluate whether the standard UV O<sub>3</sub> measurements made in SLC show a positive bias during smoke events, as has been suggested in some recent studies.Use the observations to conduct photochemical modeling and statistical/machine learning analyses to understand photochemistry on both smoke-influenced and non-smoke days.<i>Implications:</i> The Northern Wasatch Front area is one of ~50 metropolitan regions in the U.S. that do not meet the 2015 O<sub>3</sub> standard.
