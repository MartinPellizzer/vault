The catalyst was used to effectively decompose toluene in water under O3/UV conditions, and some properties including the morphology, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction patterns, specific surface area and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy were analyzed. A removal efficiency of 90.7% was achieved in the presence of fresh AC-supported Fe-TNTs calcined at 550 \u00b0C, with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.038/min. The removal efficiency of toluene was reduced when the catalysts were repeatedly used, since the amount of adsorption sites of the supporting substrates decreased. However, even after AC-supported catalyst was used four times, the removal efficiency of toluene was still sufficient in water treatment. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of AC-supported Fe-TNTs was related to the synergistic effect of AC adsorption and Fe-TNTs photocatalytic ozonation. The water from a petrochemical company in China was used to obtain the removal efficiency of the pollutants, and the toluene and total organic carbon removal efficiencies were 69.9% and 58.3%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China E-mail: zhoubeihai@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Rongfang", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China E-mail: zhoubeihai@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Beihai", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PetroChina Huabei Petrochemical Company, Renqiu, Hebei 062552, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanotubes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photoelectron Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25116493", "10.2166/wst.2014.239"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
