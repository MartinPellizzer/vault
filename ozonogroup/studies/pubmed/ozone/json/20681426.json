The project was conducted in four identical tunnel-ventilated houses. Two houses served as treatment and the other two served as control units. The experiment was replicated in five consecutive flocks. Except for ozonation treatment, all other operational parameters including feed, broiler strain, age and number of broilers, and ventilation system were the same among four houses. NH3 and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the treatment and control houses were measured for a minimum of 48 hr/week throughout the five flocks of 8 or 9 weeks each. The gas measurements were conducted using portable multigas units (PMUs). House temperatures were recorded with data loggers in each flock. Comparison of temperatures and CO2 concentrations among houses indicated no significant differences in ventilation rates among treatment and control houses in any of the five flocks. As a result, comparisons of NH3 concentrations inside houses were used to evaluate the effectiveness of house ozonation for NH3 emission mitigation. Statistical test of mean NH3 concentrations for each flock separated by house indicated that the house-to-house variation was significantly smaller than the flock-to-flock variation. There was a substantial variation in NH3 concentrations across different flocks, but no house had consistently higher or lower mean NH3 concentrations than any other. Evaluations for differences in mean NH3 from week to week, between treatment groups, and differences in week-to-week variations between treatment groups suggested that ozone effect was not uniform for each week and the effect was not statistically significant for any week. Tests of overall ozone treatment effect and treatment-week interaction indicated there was no difference in mean NH3 between the control and ozone treatment groups (P = 0.25), nor was the week effect different for control and treatment groups (P = 0.46). The results of this field evaluation indicate that there was no statistical evidence to suggest that the ozone treatment has any effect on average NH3 concentrations in these chicken houses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological and Agricultural Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7625, USA. ling_want@ncsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lingjuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oviedo-Rond\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Edgar O", "Initials": "EO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Small", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zifei", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheldon", "ForeName": "Brian W", "Initials": "BW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Havenstein", "ForeName": "Gerald B", "Initials": "GB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "C Mike", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Husbandry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Housing, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20681426", "10.3155/1047-3289.60.7.789"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
