The major dermatologic journals frequently have articles on new applications for phototherapy. The science of photobiology has advanced rapidly over the last ten years and probably will continue to do so. One fact that should be kept in mind when using an ultraviolet light apparatus is the possibility of the generation of ozone, a toxic gas. In this study, a number of devices commonly used by many dermatologists in phototherapy were monitored for ozone production. Although some of the equipment examined can produce ozone, it is produced at very low levels, dissipates quickly, and poses no health threat."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "E K", "Initials": "EK", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cutis", "NlmUniqueID": "0006440", "ISSNLinking": "0011-4162"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dermatology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Phototherapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7307562"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
