Various methods have been developed to remove ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> but require additional chemicals or energy input. In this study, an overlooked mitigation pathway of ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> by solar light photolysis with a bonus for simultaneous removal of micropollutant co-present was reported. ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> could be efficiently decomposed to chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and chlorate by simulated solar light (SSL) at water-relevant pHs with Cl<sup>-</sup> yield up to 65% at neutral pH. Multiple reactive species including hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), chloride radical (Cl\u2022), and chlorine oxide radical (ClO\u2022) were generated in the SSL/ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> system with the steady-state concentrations following the order of O<sub>3</sub> (\u2248 0.8 \u03bc\u039c) > ClO\u2022 (\u2248 4.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-6</sup> \u03bc\u039c)> \u2022OH (\u2248 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-7</sup> \u03bc\u039c)> Cl\u2022 (\u2248 6.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-8</sup> \u03bc\u039c) at neutral pH under investigated condition. Bezafibrate (BZF) as well as the selected six other micropollutants was efficiently degraded by the SSL/ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> system with pseudofirst-order rate constants ranging from 0.057 to 0.21 min<sup>-1</sup> at pH 7.0, while most of them were negligibly degraded by SSL or ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment alone. Kinetic modeling of BZF degradation by SSL/ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> at pHs 6.0 - 8.0 suggested that \u2022OH contributed the most, followed by Cl\u2022, O<sub>3</sub>, and ClO\u2022. The presence of water background components (i.e., humic acid, bicarbonate, and chloride) exhibited negative effects on BZF degradation by the SSL/ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> system, mainly due to their competitive scavenging of reactive species therein. The mitigation of ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and BZF under photolysis by natural solar light or in realistic waters was also confirmed. This study discovered an overlooked natural mitigation pathway for ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and micropollutants, which has significant implications for understanding their fate in natural environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
