Different pre-treatment i.e. physical (ultrasonication), chemical (acid, ozone) and combined (ultrasonication-ozone) methods were investigated and evaluated in terms of BMP and biodegradation. Ultrasonic pre-treatment had the best result among the single technologies, the BMP increased by 104.7%, while total solid (TS), volatile solid (VS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction were improved by 30.1%, 36.9% and 33.9%, respectively, over control. Combined pre-treatment (ultrasonication-ozone) showed more significant enhancement than single methods as evidenced by 138.2% higher BMP and 53.7%, 63.7% and 57.3% more reduction in TS, VS, COD, respectively, over control. The BMP increment positively correlated either with energy input, concentration or dose of pre-treatment applied. Among the tested methods, the physical pre-treatments out-compete chemical ones. Ultrasonic combined with ozone pre-treatment technology has good energy and economic feasibility."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
