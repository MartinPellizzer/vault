High contact times are required for Giardia inactivation by chlorination, while ozonation may be effective at much lower Ct products. In this study, we have assessed the occurrence of Giardia cysts in raw water, and in chlorinated or ozonated water from a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) in Brazil, over a 16-month period. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of primary disinfection on cysts, and calculated the infection risk caused by the occurrence of Giardia cysts in raw water, chlorinated or ozonated water. Furthermore, we assessed the correlation of Giardia cysts with indicator bacteria in raw water. Data referring to concentration of Giardia cysts in raw water showed adherence to a gamma distribution at a significance level \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05. The detection frequency and the mean concentration of Giardia cysts were higher in raw water (86.6%, 26 cysts\u2219L<sup>-1</sup>), than in chlorinated (46.1%, 15.7 cysts\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>) or ozonated water (43.5%, 11.1 cysts\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>). Overall, Giardia non-viable cysts were detected more frequently in ozonated water (80%) than in chlorinated water (68.2%) or raw water (37.7%). Ozonation and chlorination resulted, respectively, in \u224827.5- and \u224813- fold reduction of Giardia infection risk, when compared to the risk calculated for raw water. Total coliform and Escherichia coli proved to be suitable surrogates to predict the occurrence of Giardia cysts in raw surface water, however, the indicator bacteria may not be suitable surrogates to predict the disinfection of Giardia cysts, as no correlation was found between indicator bacteria and Giardia cysts in treated water. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the efficacy of chlorine and ozone at Ct products actually applied at a full-scale drinking water treatment plant against Giardia cysts naturally occurring in the source water, i.e. real situation. Ozonation has proven more efficient than chlorination against Giardia cysts in surface water. Escherichia coli proved to be suitable surrogate to predict Giardia cysts in raw surface water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
