Don) logs. The effects of dose (48 or 120 g m<sup>-3</sup> ), degree of bark cover (0, 50 or 100%) and end-grain sealing (sealed or unsealed) on sorption and desorption were determined over time.", "Sorption of MB was proportional to the dose applied and dependent on the amount of end-grain sealed. After 16 h, an average of 70.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5% of the initial concentration remained in the treated space when end-grains were sealed, whereas only 47.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5% remained when unsealed. During aeration, MB was released from logs, initially ranging from 2.8 to 8.8 g\u2009\u00b7\u2009h m<sup>-3</sup> , depending on the treatment. The rate of desorption quickly decreased during aeration.", "The surface area of a log is the most important factor influencing MB sorption and desorption rates, with greater surface area resulting in greater (de)sorption rates. Sorption data can now be combined with insect toxicity data to estimate a minimum effective dose of MB for further evaluation, while desorption data can be combined with fumigant plume modelling to assess worker safety. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited, Palmerston North, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "Matthew", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited, Palmerston North, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Najar-Rodriguez", "ForeName": "Adriana", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited, Palmerston North, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Adlam", "ForeName": "Anthony", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited, Palmerston North, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "Alistair", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited, Palmerston North, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Brash", "ForeName": "Don", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27404947", "10.1002/ps.4355"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
