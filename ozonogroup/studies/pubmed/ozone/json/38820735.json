SPC emerges as a promising alternative to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), hailed for its superior transportation safety, stability, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendliness, thereby becoming a staple in advanced oxidation processes for mitigating water pollution. Yet, scholarly literature scarcely explores the deployment of percarbonate-AOPs in eradicating organic contaminants from aquatic systems. Consequently, this review endeavors to demystify the formation mechanisms and challenges associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in percarbonate-AOPs, alongside highlighting directions for future inquiry and development. The genesis of ROS encompasses the in situ chemical oxidation of activated SPC (including iron-based activation, discharge plasma, ozone activation, photon activation, and metal-free materials activation) and composite in situ chemical oxidation via PMC (namely, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2/</sub>NaHCO<sub>3</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, peroxymonosulfate/NaHCO<sub>3</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> systems). Moreover, the ROS generated by percarbonate-AOPs, such as \u2022OH, O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>, HO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, can work individually or synergistically to disintegrate target pollutants. Concurrently, this review systematically addresses conceivable obstacles posing percarbonate-AOPs in real-world application from the angle of environmental conditions (pH, temperature, coexisting substances), and potential ecological toxicity. Considering the outlined challenges and advantages, we posit future research directions to amplify the applicability and efficacy of percarbonate-AOPs in tangible settings. It is anticipated that the insights provided in this review will catalyze the progression of percarbonate-AOPs in water purification endeavors and bridge the existing knowledge void."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
