However, the BAC process has been reported to have antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks. In this study, a new BAC-related treatment process was developed to reduce AMR caused by BAC treatment: ozone/peroxymonosulfate-BAC (O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC). The O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC showed better treatment performance on the targeted five antibiotics and dissolved organic matter removal than O<sub>3</sub>-BAC and BAC treatments. The O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC process had better control over the AMR than the O<sub>3</sub>-BAC and BAC processes. Specifically, the amount of targeted antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the effluent and biofilm of O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC was only 0.01-0.03 and 0.11-0.26 times that of the BAC process, respectively. Additionally, the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC process removed 1.76 %-62.83 % and 38.14 %-99.27 % more of the targeted ARGs in the effluent and biofilm than the BAC process. The total relative abundance of the targeted 12 ARGs in the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC effluent was decreased by 86 % compared to the effluent after BAC treatment. In addition, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were probably the main hosts for transmitting ARGs in this study, and their relative abundance decreased by 9.6 % and 6.0 % in the effluent of the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC treatment compared to that in BAC treatment. The relationship analysis revealed that controlling antibiotic discharge was crucial for managing AMR, as antibiotics were closely related to both ARGs and bacteria associated with their emergence. The results showed that the newly developed treatment process could reduce AMR caused by BAC treatment while ensuring effluent quality. Therefore, O<sub>3</sub>/PMS-BAC is a promising alternative to BAC treatment for future applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
