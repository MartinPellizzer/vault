Ozone foam fractionation emerges as a promising technology for PFAS removal to address the issue. This study aims to (i) assess the effectiveness of the ozone foam fractionation system to remove PFAS from landfill leachate, and (ii) quantify equilibrium PFAS adsorption onto the gas-water interface of ozone bubbles, followed by a comparison with air foam fractionation. The results show that ozone foam fractionation is effective for PFAS removal from landfill leachate, with more than 90 % long-chain PFAS removed. The identified operating conditions provide valuable insights for industrial applications, guiding the optimization of ozone flow rates (1 L/min), dosing (43 mg/L) and minimizing foamate production (4 % wettability). The equilibrium modelling reveals that the surface excess of air bubbles exceeds that of ozone bubbles by 20-40 % at a corresponding PFAS concentration. However, the overall removal of PFAS from landfill leachate by ozone foam fractionation remains substantial. Notably, ozone foam fractionation generates foamate volumes 2 - 4 times less, resulting in significant cost savings for the final disposal of waste products and reduced site storage requirements."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
