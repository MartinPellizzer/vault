In most cases, the effluent streams from textile plants are highly colored, and treatment methods for dye decolorization such as chemical oxidation need to be explored. The oxidation processes investigated in this study are those of ozonation, ultrasound, and ultrasound-enhanced ozonation. The oxidation of an anthraquinone dye was studied under conditions of varying ultrasonic power, dye concentration, ozone concentration, pH, and temperature. Laboratory experiments were performed using a semibatch reactor by ozonating dye samples with and without ultrasound. Under conditions of constant ultrasonic radiation and continuous gas application, decolorization rates have been enhanced by ultrasound. The apparent first-order rate constants increased between 35 and 204% for the ultrasonic power inputs between 40 W/L and 120 W/L compared with ozonation alone. The effects of ultrasonic power input on the gas-liquid mass-transfer coefficient were also investigated and the results indicate that an increase in ultrasonic power input increases the mass-transfer coefficient. The mass-transfer coefficient increased between 89 and 93% for ozone inlet concentrations between 5.4 and 9.4 mg/L at an ultrasonic power of 120 W/L compared with ozonation alone. The reactions of the dye with ultrasound-enhanced ozone occurred through the hydroxyl radical pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark 19716, USA. lall@che.udel.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lall", "ForeName": "Raman", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mutharasan", "ForeName": "Raj", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Y T", "Initials": "YT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dhurjati", "ForeName": "Prasad", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12772962", "10.2175/106143003x140953"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
