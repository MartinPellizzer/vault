Heat wave and ozone pollution were simulated on the Shanghai Meteorological and Environmental Animal Exposure System. Eighteen hypertensive rats were randomly divided into a control group, an ozone group, and a heat wave plus ozone group. The experimental groups were transferred to the exposure system for exposure to the ozone and heat wave plus ozone. After exposure, blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta, and the hearts were harvested in all groups. The concentrations of inflammatory factors, vasomotion factors, cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative stress and thrombosis factors and heat stress factors in heart tissue were measured in each rat. Ozone exposure and heat wave plus ozone exposure increased the levels of inflammatory factors, thrombosis factors, vasomotion factors and cardiovascular risk factors, except for HDL-C, which was reduced. Moreover, experimental exposure increased the heat stress factors and oxidative stress, except for SOD, which was decreased. These data demonstrated that both ozone exposure and heat wave plus ozone exposure could adversely affect hypertensive rats, and that heat wave may enhance the toxic effect of ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1434-9575"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Jingping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Provincial Meteorological Bureau, Shijiazhuang, 050021, China. zhangsy@cma.gov.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorology and Ecological Environment of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, 050021, China. zhangsy@cma.gov.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shuyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Quanquan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yangtze River Delta Environmental Weather Forecast Center, Shanghai, 200000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biometeorol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374716", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32440829", "10.1007/s00484-019-01788-w", "10.1007/s00484-019-01788-w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
