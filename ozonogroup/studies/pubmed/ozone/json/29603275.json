The strawberry aroma is complex as many kinds of volatile compounds are found in strawberries. In this review, we describe the current knowledge of the constituents and of the biosynthesis of strawberry volatile compounds, and the effect of postharvest treatments on aroma profiles. The characteristic strawberry volatile compounds consist of furanones, such as 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone and 4-methoxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone; esters, including ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl butanoate, and methyl hexanoate; sulfur compounds such as methanethiol, and terpenoids including linalool and nerolidol. As for postharvest treatment, the present review discusses the overview of aroma volatiles in response to temperature, atmosphere, and exogenous hormones, as well as other treatments including ozone, edible coating, and ultraviolet radiation. The future prospects for strawberry volatile biosynthesis and metabolism are also presented. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing, College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jia-Wei", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical and Biological Processing Technology of Farm Products, Zhejiang Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Agricultural Biological Resources Biochemical Manufacturing, School of Biological and chemical Engineering/School of Light Industry, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ban", "ForeName": "Zhao-Jun", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing, College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Hong-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing, College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Postharvest Science, ARO, the Volcani Center, RishonLeZion, Israel."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1646-2624"], "LastName": "Poverenov", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing, College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8232-9739"], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zi-Sheng", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing, College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1242-3866"], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavoring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavoring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fragaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29603275", "10.1002/jsfa.9039"]}}]}
