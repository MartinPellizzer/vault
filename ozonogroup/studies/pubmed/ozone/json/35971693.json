The results showed that the average <i>\u03c6</i>(VOCs) was (10.21\u00b15.71)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, in which alkanes accounted for 66.35%, alkenes for 11.89%, alkynes for 7.75%, and aromatics for 14.01%. VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> were high at night and low during the day, whereas the change trend of O<sub>3</sub> was opposite. Considering the species activity, it was determined that toluene, ethylene, <i>m/p</i>-xylene, 1-hexene, <i>n</i>-butane, isopentane, <i>n</i>-pentane, and isoprene were the key species affecting atmospheric VOCs in Dalian. Priority control of olefin and aromatic hydrocarbon emissions is the key to improve O<sub>3</sub> pollution in summer in Dalian. By applying the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, six major VOCs sources were extracted, namely traffic sources (26.38%), combustion sources (22.75%), industrial emission sources (17.09%), solvent usage sources (14.59%), natural sources (11.72%), and others (7.47%). The emissions of traffic sources and combustion sources are the key pollution sources for O<sub>3</sub> prevention and control in Dalian in summer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Ke-Xin", "Initials": "KX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li-Zhong", "Initials": "LZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xi'an Environmental Monitoring Station, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huan-Wu", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Jing-Qi", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ran-Ran", "Initials": "RR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35971693", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202110235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
