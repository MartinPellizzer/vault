The degradation rates of RB in both O<sub>3</sub> and UV/O<sub>3</sub> systems were enhanced by NaCl (the k increased from 0.080 to 0.116 to 0.132 and 0.267 min<sup>-1</sup> respectively), while mineralization rate varied at different salt conditions. In addition, UV irradiation promoted the degradation efficiency of RB with the presence of salt. Singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) was the primary active species in the UV/O<sub>3</sub> system. The quenching experiments and signal intensity of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> corresponded well to the mineralization of RB. Under conditions of high salinity and high pH, O<sub>3</sub> has high mass transfer coefficient (k<sub>La</sub>, 3.303 min<sup>-1</sup>) and self-decomposition (k<sub>d</sub>, 0.600 min<sup>-1</sup>), which further promoted the formation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> for mineralization of RB. Furthermore, UV/O<sub>3</sub> system was efficient in real textile wastewater treatment (COD<sub>Cr</sub> removal rate 91.7% and decolorization rate 98.7%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
