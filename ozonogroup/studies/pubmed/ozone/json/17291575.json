Individual information on frequency of exercise was obtained by interviewing their relatives at all four death registries. The deceased subjects were categorized as never-exercise (<once/month) and exercise (> or =once/month). Excess risks (ER) of mortality per 10 microg/m(3) increase of air pollutant were estimated separately by a Poisson regression model in the exercise and never-exercise groups. An interaction model was used to estimate the difference in ER between the two groups.", "In people aged 65 years or older and categorized as never-exercise group, there were significant ER of mortality for all natural causes attributed to nitrogen dioxide (p<0.05), ozone (p<0.05) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mum or smaller (p<0.01). When compared to the exercise group, the ER were significantly higher by 4.31% (95% confidence interval: 2.57%, 6.03%), 1.75% (0.25%, 3.23%), and 3.06% (1.74%, 4.37%), respectively. The estimates were insensitive to adjustment for socioeconomic, smoking and health status, and were non-linear by different exercise levels.", "The results of this study provide evidence that habitual exercise may prevent premature death attributable to air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, 5th Floor, Faculty of Medicine Building, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Chit-Ming", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Chun-Quan", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thach", "ForeName": "Thuan-Quoc", "Initials": "TQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chau", "ForeName": "Yuen-Kwan", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "King-Pan", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "Sai-Yin", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Roger Y", "Initials": "RY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "Tai-Hing", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hedley", "ForeName": "Anthony J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Prev Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0322116", "ISSNLinking": "0091-7435"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17291575", "10.1016/j.ypmed.2006.12.012", "S0091-7435(06)00562-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
