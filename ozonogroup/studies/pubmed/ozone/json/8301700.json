This aim was accomplished through inhalation coexposures of Swiss mice for 4 h to target concentrations of 10 mg/m3 of carbon black and 1.5 ppm O3, or exposure to either agent alone. As a control for the coexposure experiments, mice were also exposed for 4 h to carbon black, followed immediately thereafter by exposure for 4 h to O3, or vice versa. At 24 h after exposure, the lungs of the animals were lavaged for quantitation of total and differential cell counts and assessment of AM Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Exposure to carbon black did not result in an inflammatory response, nor had it any effect on AM phagocytosis. Ozone exposure resulted in an inflammatory response in the lungs and suppression of AM phagocytosis. Both biologic parameters were significantly enhanced following combined exposure to the particle and the gas. Carbon black exposure either before or after O3 had no significant effect on AM phagocytosis as compared to O3 exposure alone. These data demonstrate the toxicologic interaction of coexposures to an inert particle and O3 on well-accepted biologic markers pulmonary toxicity. The mechanism for the enhanced biologic effect may be that the carbon black particle acts as a carrier mechanism for O3 to areas in the distal lung not accessible to O3 in the gaseous phase or that O3 alters the physicochemistry of the particulate from a nontoxic to a toxic form."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jakab", "ForeName": "G J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hemenway", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ESO5429", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "NIEHS P30 ESO3819", "Acronym": "EH", "Agency": "NCEH CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8301700", "10.1080/15287399409531838"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
