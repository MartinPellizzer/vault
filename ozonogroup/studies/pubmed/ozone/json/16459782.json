In this study, therefore, the integrations of chemical coagulation, activated carbon adsorption, Fenton oxidation and ozonation were evaluated to provide an appropriate post-treatment process for biologically pre-treated livestock wastewater. With applying a single method such as coagulation and Fenton oxidation, a yellowish brown color and COD still remained. According to the experimental result, the quality of treated wastewater including color was enough to be discharged after chemical coagulation followed by ozonation or Fenton oxidation process. Among these, ozonation was the most effective technology for decolorization. Neither simple biological nor physicochemical process provides an adequate treatability for the sufficient depletion of organics and decolorization when treating livestock wastewater. Considering only the removal efficiency, the integration of Fenton oxidation and ozonation would be an efficient alternative as a post-treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Environment & Remediation Centre, Korea Institute of Science & Technology, P.O.
