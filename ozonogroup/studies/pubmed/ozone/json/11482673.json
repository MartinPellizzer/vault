Besides qualitative differences in the appearance of macroscopic symptoms these two varieties can be used simultaneously as a reliable pair of ozone bioindicators. The occurrence of ozone in the Greek countryside was surveyed by biomonitoring in 14 rural regions over the country and by a simultaneous biomonitoring and instrumental recording of ozone concentrations at a single remote side (Pournaria, Arcadia). Phytotoxic symptoms were observed mainly on the leaves of Bel-W3 and occasionally on those of Zichnomirodata varieties, suggesting that ozone levels were high enough to affect at least sensitive species. The instrumental monitoring (during a total period of 912 h) revealed maximum hourly O3 concentration 62 ppb, while the thresholds of 30, 40 and 50 ppb were exceeded for 40%, 20% and 6% of the recording period, respectively. The accumulated exposure over 40 ppb (AOT40) for the daylight hours over the 38 monitored days was 680 ppb h."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Agricultural University of Athens, Greece. saitanis@aua.gr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saitanis", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karandinos", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11482673", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00518-x", "S0045-6535(00)00518-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
