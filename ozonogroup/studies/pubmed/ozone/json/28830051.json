Given the mostly unknown sensitivity of tropical species to oxidative stress, the principal objective of this study was to determine whether the current O<sub>3</sub> levels in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC), downwind of S\u00e3o Paulo, affect the native vegetation of forest remnants. Foliar responses to O<sub>3</sub> of three tree species typical of the MRC forests were investigated using indoor chamber exposure experiments under controlled conditions and a field survey. Exposure to 70ppb O<sub>3</sub> reduced assimilation and leaf conductance but increased respiration in Astronium graveolens while gas exchange in Croton floribundus was little affected. Both A. graveolens and Piptadenia gonoacantha developed characteristic O<sub>3</sub>-induced injury in the foliage, similar to visible symptoms observed in >30% of trees assessed in the MRC, while C. floribundus remained asymptomatic. The underlying structural symptoms in both O<sub>3</sub>-exposed and field samples were indicative of oxidative burst, hypersensitive responses, accelerated cell senescence and, primarily in field samples, interaction with photo-oxidative stress. The markers of O<sub>3</sub> stress were thus mostly similar to those observed in other regions of the world. Further research is needed, to estimate the proportion of sensitive forest species, the O<sub>3</sub> impact on tree growth and stand stability and to detect O<sub>3</sub> hot spots where woody species in the Atlantic Forest are mostly affected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
