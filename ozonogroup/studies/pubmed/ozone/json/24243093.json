In the chemical module, oxidation of S(IV) by ozone and hydrogen peroxide in cloud-water and rainwater, as important process of the sulfate production is included. To examine the impact of topography on the sulfate redistribution in a clean and a polluted environment, the complex topography of Serbia is included in the model. Numerical simulations of an isolated summer Cumulonimbus cloud shows that thunderstorms generate very strong vertical sulfate redistribution from the planetary boundary layer to the upper troposphere. This redistribution is sensitive to cloud dynamics, while cloud microphysics and precipitation determine wet removal of the chemical species. In simulations with realistic topography, the chemical species are transported over larger distances close to the surface, while in the upper atmosphere, there is no difference compared to the simulations without topography. The sensitivity tests of cloud chemistry to the physical processes are made. Omission of nucleation and impact scavenging of aerosols in the model simulations shows that 75.8 and 62.5 % of total sulfur mass deposited in the base experiment for the clean and the polluted environment, respectively, is the result of other processes. Exclusion of oxidation accounted for 19.2 and 37.7 % of total sulfur deposited for clean and polluted environment. Ignoring the ice phase almost not change mass of deposited sulfur: there is an increase of 2.9 and 1.5 % for clean and polluted atmosphere, respectively. Real topography conditions affect the sulfate redistribution in the sense of greater possibilities of transport. Numerical simulations without real topography give an artificial increase of deposited sulfur mass of about 25-30 %."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Physics, Department of Meteorology, University of Belgrade, Dobra\u010dina 16, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia, dvujovic@ff.bg.ac.rs."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vujovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Dragana", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vu\u010dkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Vladan", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Curi\u0107", "ForeName": "Mla\u0111en", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serbia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1987 Jan 23;235(4787):460-5", "ArticleIdList": ["17810340"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2013 Jun;20(6):4216-24", "ArticleIdList": ["23247514"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24243093", "10.1007/s11356-013-2283-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
