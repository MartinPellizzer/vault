A large number of sources at Dow Chemical Co. sites within the nonattainment area may require the addition of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) for online analysis of NO(x), CO, and O2. At the outset of this work, it was not known whether the analyzers could accurately measure NO(x) as low as 2 ppm. Therefore, NO(x) CEMS analyzers from five different companies were evaluated for their ability to reliably measure NO(x) in the 2-20 ppm range. Testing was performed with a laboratory apparatus that accurately simulated different mixtures of flue gas and, on a limited basis, simulated a dual-train sampling system on a gas turbine. The results indicate that this method is a reasonable approach for analyzer testing and reveal important technical performance aspects for accurate NO(x) measurements. Several commercial analyzers, if installed in a CEMS application with sampling conditioning components similar to those used in this study, can meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's measurement data quality requirements for accuracy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dow Chemical Co., Freeport, Texas 77541, USA. sgluck@dow.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gluck", "ForeName": "Steven", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glenn", "ForeName": "Chuck", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Logan", "ForeName": "Tim", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vu", "ForeName": "Bac", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walsh", "ForeName": "Mike", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Pat", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12828335", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466208"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
