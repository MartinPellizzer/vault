Karst.) trees of different ages. Under ambient CO2 conditions, photosynthetic capacity (Amax) declined in mature trees when cumulative O3 uptake into needles, which provides a measure of effective O3 dose, exceeded 21 mmol m-2 of total needle surface area. A comparable decline in Amax of seedlings occurred when cumulative O(3) uptake was only 4.5 mmol m-2. The threshold O3 flux causing a significant decline in Amax ranged between 2.14 and 2.45 nmol m-2 s-1 in mature trees and seedlings subjected to exposure periods of > or = 70 and > or = 23 days, respectively. The greater O3 sensitivity of young trees compared with mature trees was associated with needle morphology. Biomass of a 100-needle sample increased significantly with tree age, whereas a negative correlation was found for specific leaf area, these changes parallel those observed during differentiation from shade-type to sun-type needles with tree ontogeny. Age-dependent changes in leaf morphology were related to changes in detoxification capacity, with area-based concentrations of ascorbate increasing during tree ontogeny. These findings indicate that the extent of O3-induced injury is related to the ratio of potentially available antioxidants to O3 influx. Because this ratio, when calculated for ascorbate, increased with tree age, we conclude that the ratio may serve as an empirical basis for characterizing age-related differences in tree responses to O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forstliche Bundesversuchsanstalt, Abt.
