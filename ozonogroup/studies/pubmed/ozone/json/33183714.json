The concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors, as well as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and meteorological data were obtained from the urban site (Yanchang, YC), suburban (Zhengzhou University, ZZU) and background sites (Ganglishuiku, GLSK). Result showed that the rates of O<sub>3</sub> concentration exceeded Chinese National Air Quality Standard Grade II (93.3 ppbv) were 59.0%, 52.5%, and 55.7% at the above three sites with good consistency, respectively, indicating that O<sub>3</sub> pollution is a regional problem in Zhengzhou. The daily peak O<sub>3</sub> appeared at 15:00-16:00, which was opposite to VOCs, NO<sub>x</sub>, and CO and consistent with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The exhaustive statistical analysis of meteorological factors and chemical effects on O<sub>3</sub> formation at YC was advanced. The high concentration of precursors, high temperature, low relative humidity, and moderately high wind speed together with the wind direction dominated by south and southeast wind contribute to urban O<sub>3</sub> episodes in Zhengzhou. O<sub>3</sub> formation analysis showed that reactive alkenes such as isoprene and cis-2-butene contributed most to O<sub>3</sub> formation. The VOCs/NO<sub>x</sub> ratio and smog production model were used to determine O<sub>3</sub>-VOC-NO<sub>x</sub> sensitivity. The O<sub>3</sub> formation in Zhengzhou during early summer was mainly under VOC-limited and transition regions alternately, which implies that the simultaneous emission reduction of alkenes and NO<sub>x</sub> is effective in reducing O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Zhengzhou."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
