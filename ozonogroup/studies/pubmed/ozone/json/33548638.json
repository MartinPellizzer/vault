The degradation of BPA by ozone in water is limited by the gas-mass transfer due to the low solubility of ozone. In this study, a rotating packed bed (RPB) was employed to create a high gravity environment to intensify the ozone mass transfer and BPA degradation. The effects of operational parameters (rotation speed of RPB, pH of the solution, ozone concentration, BPA concentration, gas volumetric flow rate and liquid volumetric flow rate) on BPA degradation efficiency and overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone were investigated. The results show that RPB effectively promoted the ozone mass transfer and BPA degradation and can be used for the ozonation of micropollutants that have fast reaction rates with ozone. Quenching experiments suggest that both ozone and HO\u2219 participated in BPA degradation from acidic to alkaline environments. In addition, the effects of co-existing chemicals on BPA degradation efficiency were studied. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or Cl<sup>-</sup> had no obvious impact on BPA degradation; the addition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is beneficial for BPA degradation while the addition of fulvic acid suppressed the degradation. These results indicate that the pH value, which affects the reaction rate between ozone and BPA, is a major factor to be considered during the ozonation of BPA in RPB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
