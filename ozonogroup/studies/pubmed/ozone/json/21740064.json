The purpose was to improve the poor interfacial compatibility between a selective layer of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and the surface of a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) substrate. The composite membranes thus fabricated were tested for their pervaporation performance in dehydrating an ethyl acetate/water mixture. Furthermore, the composite membranes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) for morphological change observation and by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy equipped with attenuated total reflectance (ATR-FTIR) for surface chemical composition analysis. Effects of grafting density and spin-coating speed on pervaporation performance were examined. The composite membrane pervaporation performance was elucidated by means of free volume and depth profile data obtained with the use of a variable monoenergy slow positron beam (VMSPB). Results indicated that a smaller free volume was correlated with a higher pervaporation performance of a composite membrane consisting of a selective layer of spin-coated PHEMA on a PHEMA-grafted PVDF substrate (S-PHEMA/PHEMA-g-PVDF). The composite membrane depth profile illustrated that an S-PHEMA layer spin-coated at a higher revolutions per minute (rpm) was thinner and denser than that at a lower rpm."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Center for Membrane Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, Chung Yuan University, Chung-Li 32023, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Quanfu", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jung-Tsai", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Guzman", "ForeName": "Manuel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "Wei-Song", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kueir-Rarn", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Juin-Yih", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyvinyls"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24937-79-9", "NameOfSubstance": "polyvinylidene fluoride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyvinyls"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21740064", "10.1021/la2018314"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
