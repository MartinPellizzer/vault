The results revealed that emission factors (EFs) of VOCs emitted from combustion processes ranged from 48.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.1\u00a0mg/kg (for anthracite combustion in an outdoor boiler) to 5700\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06040\u00a0mg/kg (for sesame straw combustion in a traditional stove). Changing the fuel type engendered a more significant EF reduction (82.7%) than changing the stove type (51.8%). The emitted VOCs (including oxygenated VOCs, OVOCs) can be ordered as follows (in descending order) in terms of proportion: OVOCs\u00a0>\u00a0alkenes\u00a0>\u00a0aromatic VOCs\u00a0>\u00a0alkanes\u00a0>\u00a0halo hydrocarbons\u00a0>\u00a0alkynes. These results indicate solid fuel combustion processes warrant attention because they produce high OVOC emissions. The ozone formation potential (OFP) values derived for VOCs emitted from solid fuel combustion ranged from 5.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72 to 1910\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01750\u00a0mg/kg. Clean fuel and clean stove technologies both exhibited >80% efficiency levels in reducing OFP emissions (e.g., 80.6% reduction for the optimal fuel; 89.4% reduction for a clean stove). Therefore, the difference between VOC emission profiles from different combustion technologies should not be ignored. This study also noted substantial differences between VOC emissions from residential combustion and industrial combustion. Accordingly, attention should be paid to the local characteristics of fuels and stoves and to VOC emissions from residential combustion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
