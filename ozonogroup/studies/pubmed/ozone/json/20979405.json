The stationary points are optimized by using four hybrid R(U)DFT methods. A geometry optimization method based on an approximate spin projection (AP-opt method) is applied to eliminate a spin contamination from the broken-symmetry (BS) solution. The AP-opt method reveals that a diradical intermediate for the stepwise pathway is spurious due to the spin contamination. The revised reaction profile with no diradical intermediate supports the stereospecificity. On the basis of the experimental data, the RCCSD(T) method outperforms AP-UCCSD(T), AP-UBD(T), and MkMRCCSD(4e,4o) for the systems, indicating that the RCCSD(T) method can describe the diradical character of ozone within a framework of single reference wave function. The subsequent single point energy calculations show that the highly synchronous transition state is much more favorable than the asynchronous one for 1. In the case of 2, there is not much difference between two transition states because of its asymmetric structure and charge separations in the transition states."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, 1-1 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-0043, Japan. tsaito@chem.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "Toru", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishihara", "ForeName": "Satomichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kataoka", "ForeName": "Yusuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakanishi", "ForeName": "Yasuyuki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitagawa", "ForeName": "Yasutaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawakami", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamanaka", "ForeName": "Shusuke", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okumura", "ForeName": "Mitsutaka", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "Kizashi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20979405", "10.1021/jp108302y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
