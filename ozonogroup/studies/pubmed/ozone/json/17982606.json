Camacho) at the phenological stage of anthesis. All models performed in the same range, although not all of them afforded equally significant results. Nevertheless, all of them suggest that stomatal conductance would account for the main percentage of ozone deposition fluxes. A new modeling approach was tested, based on a 3-D architectural model of the wheat canopy, and fairly accurate results were obtained. Plant species-specific measurements, as well as measurements of stomatal conductance and environmental parameters, were required. The method proposed for calculating ozone stomatal fluxes (FO(3_3-D)) from experimental gs data and modeling them as a function of certain environmental parameters in conjunction with the use of the YPLANT model seems to be adequate, providing realistic estimates of the canopy FO(3_3-D), integrating and not neglecting the contribution of the lower leaves with respect to the flag leaf, although a further development of this model is needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Salamanca, Ecology Department, Pharmacy Building, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37008, Spain. dtorre.ecol@usal.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de la Torre Llorente", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ScientificWorldJournal", "NlmUniqueID": "101131163", "ISSNLinking": "1537-744X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Imaging, Three-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17982606", "PMC5900855", "10.1100/tsw.2007.243"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
