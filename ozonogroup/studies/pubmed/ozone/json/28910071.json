The modified PEDOT:PSS with higher work function (5.66 eV) and more efficient hole injecting ability was obtained by simply mixing the aqueous PEDOT:PSS with InCl<sub>3</sub> and then consecutive ultraviolet-ozone treatment. The simply structured and solution-processed OLEDs with our modified PEDOT:PSS achieved a\u00a0very high external quantum efficiency of 21.0% using a classic thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, 2,4,5,6-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-1,3-dicyanobenzene. The origin of this great promotion was explored through photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared reflection spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy, from which we inferred that InCl<sub>3</sub> itself, the losing of insulting PSS outer shell, and transformation to quinoid structure of PEDOT chains accounted for this improvement. Our modification method of PEDOT:PSS is beneficial for promoting solution-processed organic semiconducting devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Organic Chemical Materials, Hubei Key Lab on Organic and Polymeric Optoelectronic Materials, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University , Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0764-7889"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Organic Chemical Materials, Hubei Key Lab on Organic and Polymeric Optoelectronic Materials, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University , Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Guohua", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1166-9047"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Organic Chemical Materials, Hubei Key Lab on Organic and Polymeric Optoelectronic Materials, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University , Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Shaolong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Organic Chemical Materials, Hubei Key Lab on Organic and Polymeric Optoelectronic Materials, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University , Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Manli", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Organic Chemical Materials, Hubei Key Lab on Organic and Polymeric Optoelectronic Materials, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University , Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Jiajia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9337-3460"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Organic Chemical Materials, Hubei Key Lab on Organic and Polymeric Optoelectronic Materials, Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University , Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chuluo", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28910071", "10.1021/acsami.7b09644"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
