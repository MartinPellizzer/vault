This has led to the testing of recently developed multireference techniques on the XAS of ozone, but reproduction of the experimental spectral profile has proven difficult. We utilize a minimal model consisting of a single configuration state function (CSF) per excited state to model core-level excitations of ozone, with the orbitals of each CSF optimized using the restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) method. This protocol leads to semiquantitative agreement with experimental XAS. In fact, we find that low-lying core-hole excited states in biradicaloids can be approximated with individual CSFs, despite the presence of multireference character in the ground state. We also report that the 1s \u2192 \u03c0* and 1s \u2192 \u03c3* transitions have quite distinct widths for O<sub>3</sub>. This reveals the importance of sampling over a representative range of geometries from the vibrational ground state for properly assessing the accuracy of electronic structure methods against experiments instead of the popular procedure of uniformly broadening stick spectra at the equilibrium geometry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1570-920X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and The PULSE Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Hait", "ForeName": "Diptarka", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4798-8947"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and The PULSE Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, 2575 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "Todd J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Theory Comput", "NlmUniqueID": "101232704", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9618"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38175153", "10.1021/acs.jctc.3c01035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
