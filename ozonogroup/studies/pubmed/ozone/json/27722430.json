To evaluate the hole injection functionality of the NiO<sub>x</sub> NP HIL, we compared the performance of OLEDs with three types of HILs: spin-coated PEDOT:PSS, thermally evaporated HAT-CN, and spin-coated NiO<sub>x</sub> NP films. The considerably high component ratio of NiOOH on the air-annealed NiO<sub>x</sub> NP film surface results in an enhanced hole injection functionality even without UV-ozone treatment. Consequently, the OLEDs using the NiO<sub>x</sub> NP HILs show significantly higher performances than those of the OLEDs using PEDOT:PSS along with a more than doubled lifetime. Moreover, the OLEDs using the NiO<sub>x</sub> NP layers show higher external quantum efficiency (EQE), and current and power efficiency values than those of the OLEDs using HAT-CN at a high luminance level. Most notably, the device shows considerably higher current and power efficiency values than those of the recently reported state-of-the-art OLEDs using other types of metal-oxide or metal-based HILs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center (ADRC), Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, 26, Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jeonggi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea and Division of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Hui Joon", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-1740, USA."}], "LastName": "Grigoropoulos", "ForeName": "Costas P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8119-9677"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea. dhl@gachon.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Daeho", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center (ADRC), Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, 26, Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanoscale", "NlmUniqueID": "101525249", "ISSNLinking": "2040-3364"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27722430", "10.1039/c6nr04643f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
