However, aiming for commercialization, it still encounters challenges for the large-scale module fabrication, especially for flexible devices which have attracted intensive attention recently. Low-temperature processed high-performance electron-transporting layers (ETLs) are still difficult. Herein, we present a facile low-temperature synthesis of crystalline SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals (NCs) as efficient ETLs for flexible PSCs including modules. Through thermal and UV-ozone treatments of the SnO<sub>2</sub> ETLs, the electron transporting resistance of the ETLs and the charge recombination at the interface of ETL/perovskite were decreased. Thus, the hysteresis-free highly efficient rigid and flexible PSCs were obtained with PCEs of 19.20 and 16.47%, respectively. Finally, a 5 \u00d7 5 cm<sup>2</sup> flexible PSC module with a PCE of 12.31% (12.22% for forward scan and 12.40% for reverse scan) was fabricated with the optimized perovskite/ETL interface. Thus, employing presynthesized SnO<sub>2</sub> NCs to fabricate ETLs has showed promising for future manufacturing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bu", "ForeName": "Tongle", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Shengwei", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yifan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jielin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xueping", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Junhao", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "Zhiliang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4967-6987"], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering , Monash University , Clayton , Victoria 3800 , Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yi-Bing", "Initials": "YB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing , Wuhan University of Technology , Wuhan 430070 , PR China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8635-9262"], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Fuzhi", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29633612", "10.1021/acsami.8b02624"]}}]}
