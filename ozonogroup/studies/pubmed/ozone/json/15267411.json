We use local density approximation density functional theory (LDA-DFT) calculations to compute the adsorption energies and vibrational frequencies for CO(2) adsorbed on SWNT bundles. The LDA-DFT calculations give a range of shifts for the asymmetric stretching mode from about -6 to -20 cm(-1) for internally bound CO(2), and a range from -4 to -16 cm(-1) for externally bound CO(2) at low densities. The magnitude of the shift is larger for CO(2) adsorbed parallel to the SWNT surface; various perpendicular configurations yield much smaller theoretical shifts. The asymmetric stretching mode for CO(2) adsorbed in groove sites and interstitial sites exhibits calculated shifts of -22.2 and -23.8 cm(-1), respectively. The calculations show that vibrational mode softening is due to three effects: (1) dynamic image charges in the nanotube; (2) the confining effect of the adsorption potential; (3) dynamic dipole coupling with other adsorbate molecules. Infrared measurements indicate that two families of CO(2) adsorption sites are present. One family, exhibiting a shift of about -20 cm(-1) is assigned to internally bound CO(2) molecules in a parallel configuration. This type of CO(2) is readily displaced by Xe, a test for densely populated adsorbed species, which are expected to be present on the highest adsorption energy sites in the interior of the nanotubes. The second family exhibits a shift of about -7 cm(-1) and the site location and configuration for these species is ambiguous, based on comparison with the theoretical shifts. The population of the internally bound CO(2) may be enhanced by established etching procedures that open the entry ports for adsorption, namely, ozone oxidation followed by annealing in vacuum at 873 K. Xenon displacement experiments indicate that internally bound CO(2) is preferentially displaced relative to the -7 cm(-1) shifted species. The -7 cm(-1) shifted species is assigned to CO(2) adsorbed on the external surface based on results from etching and Xe displacement experiments."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2004 American Institute of Physics."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yim", "ForeName": "Wai-Leung", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Byl", "ForeName": "Oleg", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yates", "ForeName": "John T", "Initials": "JT", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "J Karl", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15267411", "10.1063/1.1648017"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
