The concentrations of APM at this site (total proteins: 0.16 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> and total FAAs: 9.7 \u00b1 5.6 ng m<sup>-3</sup>, annual average) are comparable to those of marine APM. The major FAA species of APM are also similar to previously reported marine APM with glycine as the dominant species (31%). Based on the different seasonal trends and weak correlations of total proteins and FAAs, we found that they were contributed by different sources, especially with the influence of long-range transport from the Asian continent of northern China and Mongolia and the oceanic area of the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. The photochemical oxidation processes of high-molecular-weight proteins releasing FAAs (especially glycine) were also considered as an important factor influencing the characteristics of APM at this site. In addition, we propose a degradation process based on the correlation with ozone and ultraviolet radiation, emphasizing their roles in the degradation of proteins. Our findings help to deepen the understanding of atmospheric photochemical reaction processes of organic aerosols."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Lab of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaoying", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6919-9148"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Lab of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yingyi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Lab of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Luhan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1190-3726"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chubu Institute for Advanced Studies, Chubu University, Kasugai, Aichi 487-8501, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kawamura", "ForeName": "Kimitaka", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chubu Institute for Advanced Studies, Chubu University, Kasugai, Aichi 487-8501, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kunwar", "ForeName": "Bhagawati", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Regional Environmental Research, National Institute of Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan."}], "LastName": "Takami", "ForeName": "Akinori", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Biology and Marine Science, Faculty of Science, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa 903-0213, Japan."}], "LastName": "Arakaki", "ForeName": "Takemitsu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4990-3679"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Lab of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Senchao", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE7660XO1C", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35358385", "10.1021/acs.est.1c08658"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
