This study examined the effects of short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> on emergency admissions to the hospital for mental disease in Seoul, Korea. Data regarding 80,634 emergency admissions for mental diseases were collected from a nationally centralized healthcare claims database in Seoul during 2003-2013. Generalized linear models with climate variables were used to examine associations between short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and mental disease admissions. To comprehensively assess PM<sub>2.5</sub> effects, we used single- and two-pollutant models, which considered other pollutants in combination with PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The relative risk (RR) of emergency admissions for mental disease was 1.008 (95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.015) for each 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in 2-day average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration. This effect persisted or became slightly stronger in the two-pollutant models that included carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or sulfur dioxide (RR, 1.01-1.021), but association appeared to be limited to individuals <\u202f65 years of age. Significant association was estimated only during the warm season (RR, 1.021-1.023) in the two-pollutant models. The exposure-response curve was steeper at lower concentrations, suggesting that the risk of mental disease at lower concentrations of pm2.5 (0-30\u202f\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>). PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with increased admissions even when it was below the World Health Organization's Air Quality Guidelines (25\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), but the association was not statistically significant. Thus, based on the data from a large database, exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with increases in emergency admissions for mental diseases, and this association was significant during the warm season. PM<sub>2.5</sub> may even affect mental disease at levels below the current air quality guidelines. These results provide substantial insight regarding the effects of air pollutants and have important implications for policy makers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
