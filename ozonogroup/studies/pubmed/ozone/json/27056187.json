The subjects of the consideration were 1. application of reagents forming fluorescent products (for catecholamines - glyoxylic acid, for histamine - formaldehyde or ortho-phthalic aldehyde) to show the presence and binding of the compounds in cells, 2. binding of their fluorescent agonists and antagonists with cell, 3. effects of the compounds, their agonists and antagonists on autofluorescence, 4. action of external factors on the accumulation of the compounds in cells. How neurotransmitters can bind to certain cellular compartments has been shown on intact individual cells (vegetative microspores, pollens, secretory cells) and isolated organelles. The staining with reagents on biogenic amines leads to the appearance blue or blue-green emission on the surface and excretions of intact cells as well in some DNA-containing organelles within cells. The difference between autofluorescence and histochemically induced fluorescence may reflect the occurrence and amount of biogenic amines in the cells studied. Ozone and salinity as external factors can regulate the emission of intact cells related to biogenic amines. After the treatment of isolated cellular organelles with glyoxylic acid blue emission with maximum 460-475\u00a0nm was seen in nuclei and chloroplasts (in control variants in this spectral region the noticeable emission was absent) and very expressive fluorescence (more than twenty times as compared to control) in the vacuoles. After exposure to ortho-phthalic aldehyde blue emission was more noticeable in nuclei and chloroplasts. Fluorescent agonists (muscarine, 6,7-diOHATN, BODIPY-dopamine or BODIPY-5HT) or antagonists (d-tubocurarine for acetylcholine, yohimbine for dopamine and norepinephrine, inmecarb for serotonin) of neurotransmitters that bound with animal receptors fluorescent in blue (460-480\u00a0nm) or blue-green (490-530\u00a0nm) and usually are bound with the plasmatic membrane of intact cells or with membrane of the isolated organelles studied. In some model cells autofluorescence (belonging to chlorophyll or not, for example secondary metabolites) may be stimulated by exogenous biogenic amines or their agonists and, on the contrary, be inhibited by certain antagonists. The fluorescence data may be applied for the testing in ecological monitoring, medicine and pharmacology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Cell Biophysics, Institutskaya str. 3, Pushchino, Moscow region, Russia, 142290. roshchinavic@mail.ru."}], "LastName": "Roshchina", "ForeName": "Victoria V", "Initials": "VV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Fluoresc", "NlmUniqueID": "9201341", "ISSNLinking": "1053-0509"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organelles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Microsc Res Tech. 2004 Jan 1;63(1):67-71", "ArticleIdList": ["14677135"]}, {"Citation": "J Physiol. 1947 Oct 15;106(4):440-55", "ArticleIdList": ["16991774"]}, {"Citation": "J Fluoresc. 2015 May;25(3):595-601", "ArticleIdList": ["25779939"]}, {"Citation": "J Neurosci Res. 2008 Nov 15;86(15):3469-80", "ArticleIdList": ["18709651"]}, {"Citation": "Biokhimiia. 1988 Jul;53(7):1078-81", "ArticleIdList": ["2460144"]}, {"Citation": "Histochem J. 1971 Nov;3(6):471-6", "ArticleIdList": ["4945893"]}, {"Citation": "Arzneimittelforschung. 1952 Jun;2(6):267-71", "ArticleIdList": ["12977648"]}, {"Citation": "ACS Chem Neurosci. 2014 May 21;5(5):329-34", "ArticleIdList": ["24661118"]}, {"Citation": "J Histochem Cytochem. 1999 Feb;47(2):261-4", "ArticleIdList": ["9889262"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1986 May;81(1):161-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16664767"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Physiol. 2011 Mar;52(3):490-508", "ArticleIdList": ["21252298"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Dev Neurosci. 1985;3(5):493-9", "ArticleIdList": ["24874958"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Signal Behav. 2011 Jun;6(6):800-9", "ArticleIdList": ["21617371"]}, {"Citation": "Jpn J Pharmacol. 1968 Jun;18(2):162-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5303514"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Signal Behav. 2013 Sep;8(9):null", "ArticleIdList": ["23838960"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 2009 Jun 12;324(5933):1441-4", "ArticleIdList": ["19423778"]}, {"Citation": "Zygote. 2016 Apr;24(2):206-18", "ArticleIdList": ["25920999"]}, {"Citation": "Bioorg Khim. 2004 Sep-Oct;30(5):512-9", "ArticleIdList": ["15562973"]}, {"Citation": "Histochemie. 1972;32(2):113-31", "ArticleIdList": ["5079517"]}, {"Citation": "Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2006;139(4):294-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16491015"]}, {"Citation": "J Pineal Res. 2009 Oct;47(3):277-83", "ArticleIdList": ["19732299"]}, {"Citation": "Dokl Biochem Biophys. 2003 Nov-Dec;393:346-9", "ArticleIdList": ["14870617"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Rev Allergy. 1985 Jul;3(3):291-318", "ArticleIdList": ["3893674"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27056187", "10.1007/s10895-016-1791-6", "10.1007/s10895-016-1791-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
