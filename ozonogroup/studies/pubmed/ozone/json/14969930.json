(Karst.)) that had been fumigated in growth chambers for weeks or months with different concentrations of SO(2), SO(2) plus ozone, or SO(2) plus NO(2). Measurements were also made on needles from older trees growing in forests in various regions of Germany with different mean annual atmospheric SO(2) emissions. In the fumigated young trees, sulfate accumulation in the needles was a linear function of atmospheric SO(2) concentration. Little or no sulfur was incorporated into the organic sulfur fraction. The mean accumulation rate of sulfate in needles of fumigated trees was about 0.4 nmol g(dw) (-1) (nl l(-1))(-1) h(-1), which is very similar to the estimated rate of uptake of atmospheric SO(2) calculated from mean stomatal conductances (15 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) and the external SO(2) concentration (the calculated rate of uptake was 0.37 nmol g(dw) (-1) (nl l(-1))(-1) h(-1)). Concentrations of organic acids and other inorganic ions did not change much in response to SO(2) fumigation. In needles collected from trees in south and southeast Germany, large differences in sulfate concentrations were observed that probably reflect SO(2) emissions in the different regions. The highest foliar sulfate concentrations, and the highest annual increase in sulfate concentration with needle age were observed in material collected from the heavily polluted Erzgebirge (up to 12 micro mol g(dw) (-1) year(-1)), followed by material from the Fichtelgebirge (up to 6 micro mol g(dw) (-1) year(-1)). If it is assumed that this annual increase is the result of uptake of SO(2) from the atmosphere, mean annual atmospheric SO(2) concentrations can be calculated. The calculated values were somewhat below the measured values in the Fichtelgebirge and in the heavily polluted Erzgebirge. Norway spruce trees can cope with high concentrations of atmospheric SO(2), provided that they can neutralize the sulfuric acid formed from SO(2). It appears that, in the field, the acid load is decreased by H(+) translocation to the roots and subsequent H(+)/K(+) exchange. However, this may be a very slow process, because it was not observed in the short-term fumigation experiments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Julius-von-Sachs-Institute of Biosciences, University of W\u00fcrzburg, Mittlerer Dallenbergweg 64, D-8700 W\u00fcrzburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaiser", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dittrich", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heber", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14969930", "10.1093/treephys/12.1.1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
