Inclusion criteria included studies of adults, aged 40+ years, that provided measures of association between the air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide [CO], sulfur dioxide, ozone [O3], particulate matter [PM] less than 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter [PM2.5], and PM less than 10 \u00b5m in diameter [PM10]) and the age-related eye disease outcomes of glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or cataract.

Consistent evidence for an association was found between PM2.5 and glaucoma, with four of four studies reporting a positive association. The pooled OR for each 10-\u00b5g/m3 increase of PM2.5 on glaucoma was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.95-1.47). Consistent evidence was also found for O3 and cataract, with three of three studies reporting an inverse association. Two of two studies reported a null association between PM2.5 and cataract, while one of one studies reported a positive association between PM10 and cataract. One of one studies reported a positive relationship between CO and AMD.
