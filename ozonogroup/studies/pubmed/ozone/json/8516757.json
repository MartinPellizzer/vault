Their unique combination of effectiveness, low toxicity, ease of use, cleanliness, and low manufacturing cost appear to make them ideal for many situations. Unfortunately, they also deplete the earth's protective ozone layer and, consequently, their production is being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. United States legislation implementing the terms of the Protocol required an end to production of ozone depleting chemicals (ODCs) by the year 2000. In November 1991, the Air Force issued a policy requiring an end to ODC purchases by the end of 1997. In February 1992, President Bush announced an even more accelerated phaseout to 1995. The Montreal Protocol is expected to be amended to reflect the more aggressive US phaseout date. This accelerated date increases the urgency of the Air Force's search for ODC alternatives, especially for mission critical uses for which no alternatives have yet been identified. The search is complicated by the fact that the requirements an alternative must meet are unique to their specific application. This paper will provide an overview of the most important Air Force halon uses and review Air Force strategies for ensuring mission continuity until alternatives can be developed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Headquarters USAF, AF/CEVV, Polution Prevention Division, Office of Civil Engineer, Bolling AFB, DC 20332-5000."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morehouse", "ForeName": "E T", "Initials": "ET", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flame Retardants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Flame Retardants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Military Science"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organizational Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8516757", "10.1016/0378-4274(93)90113-c", "0378-4274(93)90113-C"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
