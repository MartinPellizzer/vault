Other measures of fitness, including survival during pupation, sex ratio of adults, female longevity, and fecundity, were not affected. Analyses of ozonated foliage at zero, two, and seven days following fumigation demonstrated a transient but significant increase (18-24%) in soluble protein concentration. Although the concentration of the total free amino acids in ozonated foliage did not increase significantly, significant changes were observed in at least 10 specific amino acids, some of which are critical for either insect development or the production of plant defensive chemicals. A reduction in total nitrogen in ozonated foliage at seven days postfumigation indicated that nitrogen was being translocated to other portions of the plant. The implications of increases in assimilable forms of nitrogen in ozonated foliage, which lead to improved host-plant suitability for insect herbivores, are discussed both in relation to some current ecological theories and in regard to pest-management strategies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, University of California, 92521, Riverside, California."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trumble", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daniel Hare", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Musselman", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCool", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "7505563", "ISSNLinking": "0098-0331"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Oecologia. 1984 Jul;63(1):90-105", "ArticleIdList": ["28311171"]}, {"Citation": "Annu Rev Entomol. 1973;18:381-420", "ArticleIdList": ["4218469"]}, {"Citation": "Ann Entomol Soc Am. 1965 May;58(3):404-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5835861"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1962 Jul;37(4):487-91", "ArticleIdList": ["16655682"]}, {"Citation": "Atmos Environ. 1969 Nov;3(6):669-82", "ArticleIdList": ["5382204"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1971 Sep 17;44(6):1429-35", "ArticleIdList": ["5160704"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1971 Aug;23(2):149-53", "ArticleIdList": ["4397679"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1985 Nov 1;230(4725):566-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17809689"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1981 Jul;7(4):753-8", "ArticleIdList": ["24420689"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 May 7;72:248-54", "ArticleIdList": ["942051"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24301371", "10.1007/BF01020363"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
