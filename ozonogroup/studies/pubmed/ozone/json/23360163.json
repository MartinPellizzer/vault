Seasonal variations in UVB radiation and influence of ozone and clearness index on the ratio of UVB to broadband solar radiation (G) were investigated. The annual value of UVB radiation in Beijing is 6.37 MJ m(-2), and monthly average value ranges from 4.96 to 28.37 kJ m(-2) d(-1). The maximum daily total UVB radiation ranges from 6.55 kJ m(-2) d(-1) in November to 54.22 kJ m(-2) d(-1) in July. The monthly minimum of daily total UVB radiation varies from 0.5 kJ m(-2) d(-1) in February to 11.52 kJ m(-2) d(-1) in July. The monthly average of the ratio of UVB radiation to G ranges from 0.007 to 0.017%, with an annual average value of 0.012%. The variation in slant ozone column causes annual cycle of the ratio UVB radiation to G, with maximum value in summer. In addition, clouds have a greater effect on G than UVB radiation. Thus, the ratio increases by more than 17% when the atmospheric conditions change from clear to cloudy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
