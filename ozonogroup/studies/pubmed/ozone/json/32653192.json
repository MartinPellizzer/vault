In this work, O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were continuously monitored from May 27, 2018 to March 31, 2019. Our data showed that the annual average concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-8 hr, maximum 8-hour moving average of ozone days) was 39.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.74 and 86.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041.65\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> showed clear seasonal trends, with higher concentrations in winter (83.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.66\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) and lower concentrations in summer (19.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.23\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), however, the seasonal trends of O<sub>3</sub> were different with 103.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041.77\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> in summer and 58.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.40\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> in winter. Air mass backward trajectory, analyzing results of potential source contribution function model and concentration weighted trajectory model implied that pollutants from northwestern China contributed significantly to the mass concentration of Shanghai PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while pollutants from areas of eastern coastal provinces and South China Sea contributed significantly to the mass level of ozone in Shanghai atmosphere. Mass concentration of twenty-one elements in the PM<sub>2.5</sub> were investigated, and their relationships with O<sub>3</sub> were analyzed. Mass level of ozone had good correlation with that of Ba (r\u00a0=\u00a00.64, p < 0.05) and V (r\u00a0=\u00a00.30, p > 0.05), suggesting vehicle emission pollutants contribute to the increasing concentration of ozone in Shanghai atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
