Due to the high stability of azo dyes in ambient conditions, they cannot be abated in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Over the last fifteen years, the decontamination of dyeing effluents by persulfate (PS)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has received a great attention. In these methods, PS is activated to be decomposed into sulfate radical anion (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>), which is further partially hydrolyzed to hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH). Superoxide ion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) can also be produced as oxidants. This review summarizes the results reported for the discoloration and mineralization of synthetic and real waters contaminated with azo dyes covering up to November 2023. PS activation with iron, non-iron transition metals, and carbonaceous materials catalysts, heat, UVC light, photocatalysis, photodegradation with iron, electrochemical and related processes, microwaves, ozonation, ultrasounds, and other processes is detailed and analyzed. The principles and characteristics of each method are explained with special attention to the operating variables, the different oxidizing species generated yielding radical and non-radical mechanisms, the addition of inorganic anions and natural organic matter, the aqueous matrix, and the by-products identified. Finally, the overall loss of toxicity or partial detoxification of treated azo dye solutions during the PS-based AOPs is discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
