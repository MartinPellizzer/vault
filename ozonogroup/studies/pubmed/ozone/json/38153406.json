We used the GEOS-Chem adjoint model and investigated the changing sensitivities of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) to multiple species and sources from 2010 to 2020 in the central Yangtze River Delta (YRDC), the largest economic region in China. Controlling primary particles and SO<sub>2</sub> from industrial and residential sectors dominated PM<sub>2.5</sub> decline, and reducing CO from multiple sources and \u2265C<sub>3</sub> alkenes from vehicles restrained O<sub>3</sub>. The chemical regime of O<sub>3</sub> formation became less VOC-limited, attributable to continuous NO<sub><i>X</i></sub> abatement for specific sources, including power plants, industrial combustion, cement production, and off-road traffic. Regional transport was found to be increasingly influential on PM<sub>2.5</sub>. To further improve air quality, management of agricultural activities to reduce NH<sub>3</sub> is essential for alleviating PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution, while controlling aromatics, alkenes, and alkanes from industry and gasoline vehicles is effective for O<sub>3</sub>. Reducing the level of NO<sub><i>X</i></sub> from nearby industrial combustion and transportation is helpful for both species. Our findings reveal the complexity of coordinating control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution in a fast-developing region and support science-based policymaking for other regions with similar air pollution problems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse and School of the Environment, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Weiyang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0635-311X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse and School of the Environment, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210023, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Jiangsu 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Climate and Ocean-Atmosphere Sciences, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ni", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6772-0350"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Climate and Ocean-Atmosphere Sciences, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaolin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environment and Ecology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Henze", "ForeName": "Daven K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2383-8431"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Climate and Ocean-Atmosphere Sciences, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8556-7326"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Pollution Control, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Tzung-May", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John A.
