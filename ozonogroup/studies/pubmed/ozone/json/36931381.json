The ZSM-5 zeolite was used as a porous support material due to the large surface area and high capacity for adsorption of volatile organic compounds. Since Mn and Cu-loaded zeolite catalysts were effective for the catalytic ozonation of VOCs such as MEK, according to the loaded concentration of Mn and Cu, there are four types of metal loaded ZSM5 catalysts synthesized [5\u00a0wt% Mn/ZSM-5, 5\u00a0wt% Cu/ZSM-5, 5\u00a0wt% Mn-1 wt% Cu/ZSM-5 (5Mn1CuZSM), and 5\u00a0wt% Cu-1 wt% Mn/ZSM-5]. The catalytic efficiency for the removal of MEK and ozonation using the different catalysts was also studied. Based on various experimental analysis processes, the characteristics of the synthesized catalysts were explored and the removal efficiencies of MEK and O<sub>3</sub> together with the CO<sub>x</sub> concentration generated from the destruction of MEK and O<sub>3</sub> were explored. The results for the decomposition of MEK and O<sub>3</sub> at the room temperature indicated that the Mn dominant ZSM-5 catalysts showed better efficiency for the conversion of MEK and O<sub>3</sub>. The 5\u00a0wt% Mn/ZSM-5 outweighed the rest of them for the removal of MEK while the 5Mn1CuZSM showed the best catalytic reactivity for the conversion of O<sub>3</sub> and the CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity. It was ascertained that during the reaction time of catalyst and reactants of 120\u00a0min the Mn dominantly deposited bimetallic catalyst, 5Mn1CuZSM, was determined as the most effective for the removal of MEK and O<sub>3</sub> due to the high capability of production of Mn<sup>3+</sup> species and more available adsorbed oxygen sites compared to the other catalysts. Finally, the durability measurement for the 5Mn1CuZSM catalyst was performed together with the produced CO and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for 420\u00a0min."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
