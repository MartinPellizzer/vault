Activity of F-CN was superior to that of CN, with 74.3% PFOA removal by F-CN/Vis/O<sub>3</sub> but only 57.1% by CN/Vis/O<sub>3</sub>. Experimental results and theory simulations suggested that the photogenerated hole (h<sub>vb</sub><sup>+</sup>) oxidation with the help of N vacancies was vital for PFOA degradation. N vacancies on both CN and F-CN would trap O atom of PFOA and seize electron from \u03b1 -CF<sub>2</sub> group, which made PFOA more easily to be oxidized. Doping of F narrowed band gap, lowered the valence band position and enhanced the oxidation potential of h<sub>vb</sub><sup>+</sup>. The hydrophobic sites would accelerate the mass transfer of O<sub>3</sub> and PFOA, enhance O<sub>3</sub>'s single electron reduction with e<sub>cb</sub><sup>-</sup> to generate hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) and reduce the recombination of h<sub>vb</sub><sup>+</sup>-e<sub>cb</sub><sup>-</sup>. Under the joint function of h<sub>vb</sub><sup>+</sup>, N vacancies and \u2022OH, PFOA degradation in F-CN/Vis/O<sub>3</sub> proceeded through the gradually shortening of perfluoroalky chain and loss of CF<sub>2</sub> unit. The acute and chronic toxicity of generated short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acid toward fish, green algae daphnid were predicted by ECOSAR. And the toxicity change of solutions was examined by luminescent bacteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
