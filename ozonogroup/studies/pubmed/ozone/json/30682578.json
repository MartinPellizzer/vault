The use of ozone in combination with plant-based antimicrobials was evaluated as an alternative to conventional sanitizers such as chlorine. Plant based antimicrobials that were evaluated in combination with ozone included oregano oil, carvacrol, Quillaja saponin and olive extract. Ozone was dispersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), following which individual antimicrobials or their combinations were added. Iceberg lettuce leaves (10\u202fg portions) inoculated with Salmonella enterica serotype Newport (6.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202flog CFU/g) were added to the wash suspension. The leaves were tested for reduction in S. Newport population after 60, 90 and 120\u202fmin of treatment. Exposure to ozonized water for 120\u202fmin resulted in a 2.1 log CFU/g (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) reduction in S. Newport population. The addition of 0.1% oregano oil to ozonized water resulted in 3\u202flog CFU/g reduction after 120\u202fmin but a 4.1\u202flog CFU/g reduction after 60\u202fmin, indicating that the antioxidant property of oregano oil might have diminished ozone activity and resuscitated injured S. Newport cells. The addition of 5% olive extract to ozonized water resulted in 4.2\u202flog CFU/g reduction of S. Newport after 120\u202fmin (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) of treatment. While 5% olive extract did not confer protection to S. Newport cells from ozone, 1% olive extract resulted in higher S. Newport survival after 120\u202fmin treatment than the 60\u202fmin treatment. The use of carvacrol (0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5%) in ozonized water reduced the pathogen population to below the limit of detection (10 CFU/g) (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) which was in excess of 6\u202flog CFU/g. These results indicate that the efficacy of ozone is compounded by the addition of certain plant-based antimicrobials when used at optimum concentrations. Ozone combined with plant antimicrobials could serve as an effective alternative to sanitizers currently used for washing and processing of produce."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
