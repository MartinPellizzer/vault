Aerosols from the Mount Pinatubo eruption were found outside and inside the vortex with distinctly different distributions that clearly identified the dynamics of the vortex. Changes in aerosols inside the vortex indicated advection of air from outside to inside the vortex below 16 kilometers. No polar stratospheric clouds were observed and no evidence was found for frozen volcanic aerosols inside the vortex. Between January and March, ozone depletion was observed inside the vortex from 14 to 20 kilometers with a maximum average loss of about 23 percent near 18 kilometers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Browell", "ForeName": "E V", "Initials": "EV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Butler", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fenn", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schoeberl", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toon", "ForeName": "O B", "Initials": "OB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loewenstein", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Podolske", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17790351", "10.1126/science.261.5125.1155", "261/5125/1155"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
