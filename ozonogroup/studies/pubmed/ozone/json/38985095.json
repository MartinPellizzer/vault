We aimed to examine the association between short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure and site-specific cancer mortality and investigate vulnerable subgroups in Brazil. In total 3,459,826 cancer death records from 5570 Brazilian municipalities between 2000 and 2019, were included. Municipal average daily O<sub>3</sub> concentration was calculated from a global estimation at 0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0 spatial resolution. The\u00a0time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to assess the O<sub>3</sub>-cancer mortality association. Subgroup analyses by age, sex, season, time-period, region, urban hierarchy, climate classification, quantiles of GDP per capita and illiteracy rates were performed. A linear and non-threshold exposure-response relationship was observed for short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> with cancer mortality, with a 1.00% (95% CI: 0.79%-1.20%) increase in all-cancer mortality risks for each 10-\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment of three-day average O<sub>3</sub>. Kidney cancer was most strongly with O<sub>3</sub> exposure, followed by cancers of the prostate, stomach, breast, lymphoma, brain and lung. The associated cancer risks were relatively higher in the warm season and in southern Brazil, with a decreasing trend over time. When restricting O<sub>3</sub> concentration to the national minimum value during 2000-2019, a total of 147,074 (116,690-177,451) cancer deaths could be avoided in Brazil, which included 17,836 (7014-28,653) lung cancer deaths. Notably, these associations persisted despite observed adaptation within the Brazilian population, highlighting the need for a focus on incorporating specific measures to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> exposure into cancer care recommendations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
