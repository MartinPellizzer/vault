Using barometric whole-body plethysmography and increase in enhanced pause (P(enh)) as an index of airway obstruction, we measured airway responses to ozone exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Nitrate and nitrite were measured using a modified Griess reaction.", "The nitrate concentration in BAL fluid, which indicates the in vivo generation of NO in airways, from the ozone-exposed group was significantly greater than that from the group exposed to filtered air (631.0 +/- 86.4 vs. 152.1 +/- 16.9 micromol/l, p < 0.05). The nitrate concentration in BAL fluid was increased more in mice exposed to 2-ppm ozone than that in mice exposed to filtered air or 0.12-, 0.5-, or 1-ppm ozone. Increases in P(enh) after exposure to ozone or filtered air were significantly higher in the ozone-exposed groups than in the group exposed to filtered air (p < 0.01). Increases in P(enh) were dependent on the ozone concentration. Although the protein levels of eNOS and iNOS determined were within normal levels, the amount of nNOS protein was markedly elevated in airway tissue homogenates of the group exposed to 2-ppm ozone.", "These findings demonstrate that the nNOS isoform may be involved in airway obstruction in mice exposed to ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 S.
