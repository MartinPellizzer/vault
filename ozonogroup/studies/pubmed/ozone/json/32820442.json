However, the effects of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> have not been comprehensively studied on medicinal plants. Therefore, a field study was planned on a medicinally important Sida cordifolia L. plant (commonly known as country mallow or Bala) to assess the expected changes on the morphology, growth, and leaf injury under elevated O<sub>3</sub> (ambient +\u200920\u00a0ppb) by using open-top chambers (OTCs) at 30, 60, and 90\u00a0days after treatment (DAT), while leaf and root metabolites were observed at 60 DAT. At all the growth stages, significant leaf damage was recorded as foliar injury symptoms. Most of the growth parameters also showed significant reductions at all the growth stages. Plants under elevated O<sub>3</sub> showed a significant negative impact on most of the reproductive parts of the plant. Leaf weight ratio (LWR) showed significant increment at early stages while reduced at 90 DAT; however, root shoot ratio (RSR) showed a significant reduction at 60 DAT. The majority of the steroid metabolites showed an increase in root and leaves under elevated O<sub>3</sub>, while terpenes showed variable response. Due to O<sub>3</sub> stress, most of the major metabolites showed an increase possibly due to their role in defense and other metabolic activities. Based on the outcomes, it is concluded that the future increase in the levels of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> will impact a significant effect on important metabolites of medicinal plants growing in tropical countries like India."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India."}], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "Naushad", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Madhoolika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India. sbagrawal56@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Shashi Bhushan", "Initials": "SB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CSIR\\P-25\\365", "Agency": "Council\u00a0of\u00a0Scientific and Industrial Research, India", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abirami P, Rajendran A (2011) GC-MS determination of bioactive compounds of Indigofera aspalathoides.
