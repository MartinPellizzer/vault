This on-line monitoring of atmospheric pollutants requires expensive and sophisticated techniques. In order to control ambient air quality in remote regions, where no infrastructure like power supply is available, simple instruments are required. The objective of this study, which was coordinated and evaluated by the GSF-Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr Umwelt und Gesundheit was first, to investigate the vertical distribution of ozone in different parts of the Alps and secondly, in addition to continuous analyser measurements, to test monitoring by means of two types of passive samplers. The selection of these samplers - one for one week use and another one for two week application - was based on a passive sampler intercomparison done in a preliminary study one year earlier."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Bioclimatology and Environmental Research, University of Munich, Am Hochanger 13, D-85354, Freising, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Werner", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirchner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Welzl", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hangartner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1995;88(3):267-73", "ArticleIdList": ["15091538"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manage Assoc. 1990 Mar;40(3):357-8", "ArticleIdList": ["2328123"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19009409", "10.1007/BF02987554"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
