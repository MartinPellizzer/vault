Until now, satellite observation has been increasingly a valuable source for monitoring the unconventional atmospheric pollutants due to the limited availability of ground-based HCHO data. Here, we used Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the weather research and forecasting with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to synergistically analyze the spatiotemporal variations of tropospheric HCHO in Beijing during 2009-2020, and the response of O<sub>3</sub> to HCHO and NO<sub>2</sub> in hotspots. We also discuss the multiple factors influencing the variation of HCHO and identify potential source area. The results indicated that HCHO column concentration is higher in eastern Beijing, and peaking in 2018 (16.68\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>15</sup>\u00a0mol/cm<sup>2</sup>). O<sub>3</sub> shows a good response to HCHO, with higher HCHO and NO<sub>2</sub> photolysis leading to O<sub>3</sub> increase in summer. In winter, decreasing HCHO and increasing NO<sub>2</sub> inhibits the formation of O<sub>3</sub>. Transportation emissions contributed the most to HCHO, followed by the industrial sector, while residential sources have long-term effects. Isoprene produced by plants is one of the main sources of HCHO, whereas meteorological conditions can affect production efficiency. Biomass burning contributes less. Moreover, HCHO in Beijing is affected by the combined effects of local emission and external transport, and Hebei is the potential source area. This study reveals HCHO has a great accumulation potential in cities and highlights the dominant role of anthropogenic emissions, but also need to consider the influence of natural factors and regional transport."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
