These compounds react quickly with ozone (O(3)), thus ozonation during WW treatment may result in their complete removal. Also, O(3) has demonstrated the ability to increase the biodegradability of WW and certain pharmaceuticals, suggesting its potential as a pretreatment to activated sludge (AS, biological treatment). The objective of this study was to determine whether ozonation, conducted at doses lower than commonly applied to treated WW, would lead to an increased biodegradability of SMX and EE2. The results show that after ozonation performed at lab-scale the bacterial mixtures removed 5 % to 40 % more SMX; however, 2 % to 23 % less EE2 was removed, which was attributed to the observed preferential degradation of a by-product of EE2 ozonation. These results suggest that although ozonation, used as a pretreatment, was shown in literature to increase the overall biodegradability of AS as well as some specific antibiotic compounds and a blood lipid regulator, the potential for increased removal of pharmaceuticals seems to be compound-dependent and cannot yet be extrapolated to this entire class of compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, 3610 University Street, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada H3A 2B2."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larcher", "ForeName": "Simone", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yargeau", "ForeName": "Viviane", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "423D2T571U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethinyl Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JE42381TNV", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethoxazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethinyl Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22534821", "10.1007/s00253-012-4054-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
