Four catalysts of varying WO<sub>3</sub> content (0/1/3/5 wt%) were synthesized by sol-gel and characterized by XRD, TEM, STEM-EDS, HAADF-STEM, adsorption/desorption N<sub>2</sub> isotherms, and DRS-UV-vis. 5 wt% WO<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> was the optimal composition based on physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity tests with methylene blue. PFAS degradation showed that photocatalytic ozonation inefficiently degraded PFAS with WO<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> under UVA-visible light after 4 h (\u03a3PFAS removal 16 %, [range 4 %-26 %]). Photocatalysis had comparable removal to photocatalytic ozonation, photolysis and ozone photolysis showed lower removal, and ozonation had no effect. Microtox analysis showed the initial acute toxicity was no longer detectable after photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation treatment. Low PFAS removals under tested conditions require that future work evaluate different catalysts or treatment conditions, while disparities between tested PFAS removals demonstrate the need to evaluate multiple compounds. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: The research presented in this manuscript involves the preparation and characterization of WO<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts used, for the first time, to remove multiple PFAS in water via photocatalytic ozonation. This manuscript supports the development of a catalytic process for the elimination of hard to degrade environmental pollutants, provides new knowledge on aspects of photocatalytic processes, and provides insights on environmental pollution abatement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
