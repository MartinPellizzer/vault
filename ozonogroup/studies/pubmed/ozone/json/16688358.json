Most PSD studies have involved long-term (e.g. bi-weekly or monthly) sampling. But the Passive Ozone Network of Dallas (POND) studies of 1998 and 1999 showed that high quality 24-hour and 12-hour data using the Ogawa PSD could be collected for ambient ozone concentrations. This paper presents an evaluation of short-term passive sampling results for nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) in El Paso and Houston, Texas, using the Ogawa PSD. The Ogawa NO(x) PSDs were compared to both Federal Reference Method (FRM) monitors and a photolytic converter, with the photolytic converter designed to report closer concentrations to \"true\" NO(x) by more effectively limiting the interferences of other nitrogen species. Overall, good agreement was noted for all three monitor types in both cities, supporting the potential use of lower cost Ogawa PSDs for large multi-site episodic NO(x)/NO(2)/NO saturation screening studies. This evaluation was conducted during two separate six week periods of the cooler winter months so additional testing of the Ogawa PSDs during different seasons is recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Analysis Section, U.S. EPA Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, TX 75202, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sather", "ForeName": "Mark E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slonecker", "ForeName": "E Terrence", "Initials": "ET"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kronmiller", "ForeName": "Keith G", "Initials": "KG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Dennis D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daughtrey", "ForeName": "Hunter", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "Johnson", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Interpretation, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16688358", "10.1039/b601113f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
