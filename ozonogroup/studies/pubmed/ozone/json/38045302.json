A mouse model of spontaneous COPD [genetically deficient in surfactant protein-D (SP-D <sup>-/-</sup> )] and ozone (O <sub>3</sub> ) exposure were used to examine the mechanism by which lack of functional SP-D may skew ILC2s to produce IL-17A in combination with IL-5 and IL-13, leading to a mixed inflammatory profile and more severe disease.", "COPD was characterized by poor spirometry, sputum inflammation, and the emergence of sputum GATA3 <sup>+</sup> ILCs (ILC2s), but not T-bet <sup>+</sup> ILCs (ILC1s) nor ROR\u03b3t <sup>+</sup> ILCs (ILC3s). COPD subjects with elevated sputum ILC2s (the ILC2 <sup>high</sup> group) had worse spirometry and sputum neutrophilia and eosinophilia than healthy and ILC2 <sup>low</sup> subjects. This was associated with the presence of dual-positive IL-5 <sup>+</sup> IL-17A <sup>+</sup> and IL-13 <sup>+</sup> IL-17A <sup>+</sup> ILCs and nonfunctional SP-D in the sputum in ILC2 <sup>high</sup> subjects. SP-D <sup>-/-</sup> mice showed spontaneous airway neutrophilia. Lack of SP-D in the mouse lung licensed ILC2s to produce IL-17A, which was dose-dependently inhibited by recombinant SP-D.
