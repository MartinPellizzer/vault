Although studies have described a link between ambient particulate matter and increased lung cancer morbidity, no direct relation has yet been established between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and metastatic dissemination to lungs.", "To outline the mechanisms through which pulmonary O<sub>3</sub> exposure modulates metastasis kinetics in an experimental mouse model of O<sub>3</sub> exposure.", "Metastatic responses to pulmonary O<sub>3</sub> exposure were assessed using a reliable experimental mouse model of concomitant pulmonary O<sub>3</sub> exposure and tumour cell injection. Roles of neutrophils in O<sub>3</sub>-induced lung metastasis were highlighted using blocking anti-Ly6G antibodies; moreover, the implication of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in metastatic processes was evaluated using <i>MRP8cre-Pad4lox/lox</i> mice or by treating mice with DNase I.", "Pulmonary O<sub>3</sub> exposure strongly facilitates the establishment of lung metastasis by (1) Inducing a pulmonary injury and neutrophilic inflammation, (2) Influencing very early steps of metastasis, (3) Priming neutrophils' phenotype to release NETs that favour tumour cell colonisation in lungs. The ability of O<sub>3</sub>-primed neutrophils to enhance lung colonisation by tumour cells was proven after their adoptive transfer in Balb/c mice unexposed to O<sub>3</sub>.", "Pulmonary neutrophils induced by O<sub>3</sub> promote metastatic dissemination to lungs by producing NETs.
