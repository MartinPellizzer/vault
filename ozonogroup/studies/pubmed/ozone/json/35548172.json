Knowledge about the incidence and etiology of CAP in China is fragmented.", "A multicenter study performed at 4 hospitals in 4 regions in China and clinical samples from CAP patients were collected and used for pathogen identification from July 2016 to June 2019.", "A total of 1674 patients were enrolled and the average annual incidence of hospitalized CAP was 18.7 (95% confidence interval, 18.5-19.0) cases per 10000 people. The most common viral and bacterial agents found in patients were respiratory syncytial virus (19.2%) and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (9.3%). The coinfections percentage was 13.8%. Pathogen distribution displayed variations within age groups as well as seasonal and regional differences. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was not detected. Respiratory virus detection was significantly positively correlated with air pollutants (including particulate matter \u22642.5 \u00b5m, particulate matter \u226410 \u00b5m, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide) and significantly negatively correlated with ambient temperature and ozone content; bacteria detection was opposite.", "The hospitalized CAP incidence in China was higher than previously known. CAP etiology showed that differences in age, seasons, regions, and respiratory viruses were detected at a higher rate than bacterial infection overall. Air pollutants and temperature have an influence on the detection of pathogens."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
