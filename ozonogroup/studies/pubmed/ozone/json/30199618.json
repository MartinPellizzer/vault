The growth of SnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> films could be easily controlled by employing different reactants and utilizing different ozone and water concentrations, respectively. The formation of both SnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> films exhibited typical surface-limiting reaction characteristics, although their growth behaviors differ from one another. The combined studies of density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses showed that the difference in growth behavior of the SnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> films can be attributed to the stability of ozone and water on the SnO<sub>2</sub> and SnO films. SnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> films have different crystal structures and both films were crystallized from the amorphous to polycrystalline states following an increase in the deposition temperature. The absorbance and refractive index of the thin films were investigated using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), respectively. SnO <sub>x</sub> films formed using ozone and water as a reactant showed an optical band gap of 3.60-3.17 eV and 2.24-2.30 eV and refractive indices of \u223c2.0 and \u223c2.6, respectively, which correspond to values typical of SnO<sub>2</sub> and SnO. The bilayer structure of SnO/SnO<sub>2</sub> was successfully fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with nickel as a top electrode at 100 \u00b0C. The SnO/SnO<sub>2</sub> bilayer exhibited diode characteristics with a current rectification ratio of 15. Our results present a simple but highly versatile growth method for producing multilayer oxide films with electronic properties that can be finely controlled."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Materials Science and Engineering , Hanyang University , Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jung-Hoon", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering , Chungnam National University , 99 Daehak-ro , Yuseong-gu, Daejeon , 34134 , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Mi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and vdW Materials Research Center , Yonsei University , 03722 Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "DongHee", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Materials Science and Engineering , Hanyang University , Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyun-Mo", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Materials Science and Engineering , Hanyang University , Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Wan-Ho", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thin Film Material Team, Hansol Chemical, 873, Gwahak-ro , Yongam-ri, Bongdong-eup, Wanju_Gun, Jeollabuk-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jung Woo", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and vdW Materials Research Center , Yonsei University , 03722 Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4944-8319"], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Yeonjin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering , Chungnam National University , 99 Daehak-ro , Yuseong-gu, Daejeon , 34134 , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8105-1640"], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun You", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Materials Science and Engineering , Hanyang University , Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9070-5666"], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jin-Seong", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30199618", "10.1021/acsami.8b12251"]}}]}
