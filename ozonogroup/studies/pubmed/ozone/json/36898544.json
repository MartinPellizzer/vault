At alkaline pH (9-10), a rapid decline in water flux (> 50\u00a0%) and higher membrane rejection was observed, as a consequence of the increased electrostatic repulsion forces between the membrane surface and organic species. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) provides detailed insights into the WEOM compositional behavior at different pH levels. Ozonation at higher pH significantly reduced the apparent molecular weight (MW) of WEOM in the 4000-7000\u00a0Da range by transforming the large MW (humic-like) substances into small hydrophilic fractions. Fluorescence components C1 (humic-like) and C2 (fulvic-like) exhibited a predominant increase/decrease in concentration for all pH conditions during pre-ozonation and nanofiltration treatment process, however, the C3 (protein-like) component was found highly associated with the reversible and irreversible membrane foulants. The ratio C1/C2 provided a strong correlation with the formation of total trihalomethanes (THMs) (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.9277) and total haloacetic acids (HAAs) (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.5796). The formation potential of THMs increased, and HAAs decreased, with the increase of feed water pH. Ozonation markedly reduced the formation of THMs by up to 40\u00a0% at higher pH levels, but increased the formation of brominated-HAAs by shifting the formation potential of DBPs towards brominated precursors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
