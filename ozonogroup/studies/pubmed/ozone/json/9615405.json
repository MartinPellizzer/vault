These components, listed by eluting order, were acetate, propionate, formate, pyruvate, glyoxalate, dichloroacetate, oxalate and ketomalonate. The calculated method detection limits were 2-6 micrograms/l. Preliminary data were obtained by using California state project water from the filter influent of the Oxidation Demonstration Plant of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Oxalate was measured at levels above 200 micrograms/l, formate above 100 micrograms/l, acetate above 50 micrograms/l, pyruvate and glyoxalate at approximately 30 micrograms/l and propionate and ketomalonate at trace levels near the detection limits. This method utilizes a new preservative, benzalkonium chloride, as a substitute for the environmentally unsafe mercuric chloride that had previously been used. Preservation studies indicate that all eight compounds are stable for a testing period of 30 days when benzalkonium chloride is maintained at or above 30 mg/l in the water sample."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Water Quality Division, La Verne, CA 91750-3399, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzalkonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Preservatives, Pharmaceutical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzalkonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Preservatives, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9615405", "10.1016/s0021-9673(98)00089-2", "S0021-9673(98)00089-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
