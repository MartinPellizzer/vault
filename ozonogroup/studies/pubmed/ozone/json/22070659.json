This platform offers a large-scale surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate with large chemical enhancement in SERS and reproducible SERS signals over a centimeter-scale graphene surface. After UV-induced ozone generation, ozone molecules were reacted with graphene to produce oxygen-containing groups on graphene and induced the p-type doping of the graphene. These modifications introduced the structural disorder and defects on the graphene surface and resulted in a large chemical mechanism-based signal enhancement from Raman dye molecules [rhodamine B (RhB), rhodamine 6G (R6G), and crystal violet (CV) in this case] on graphene. Importantly, the enhancement factors were increased from \u223c10(3) before ozone treatment to \u223c10(4), which is the largest chemical enhancement factor ever on graphene, after 5 min ozone treatment due to both high oxidation and p-doping effects on graphene surface. Over a centimeter-scale area of this UV/ozone-oxidized graphene substrate, strong SERS signals were repeatedly and reproducibly detected. In a UV/ozone-based micropattern, UV/ozone-treated areas were highly Raman-active while nontreated areas displayed very weak Raman signals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huh", "ForeName": "Sung", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jaesung", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Young Soo", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kwang S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Byung Hee", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nam", "ForeName": "Jwa-Min", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7782-42-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Graphite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Graphite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Nanostructures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scattering, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Surface Plasmon Resonance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22070659", "10.1021/nn204156n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
