The photosynthesis-based model for the PX LSM (PX PSN) is implemented and evaluated in a diagnostic box model that has evapotranspiration and ozone deposition components taken directly from WRF/CMAQ. We evaluate PX PSN for latent heat (LH) estimation at four FLUXNET sites with different vegetation types and landscape characteristics and at one FLUXNET site with ozone flux measurements against the simple Jarvis approach used in the current PX LSM. Overall, the PX PSN simulates LH as well as the PX Jarvis approach. The PX PSN, however, shows distinct advantages over the PX Jarvis approach on grassland that likely results from its treatment of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation estimation. Simulations using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI rather than LAI observations assess how the model would perform with the grid averaged data available in the Eulerian grid model (WRF/CMAQ). While MODIS LAI generally follows the seasonality of the observed LAI, it cannot capture the extreme highs and lows of the site measurements. MODIS LAI estimates degrade model performance at all sites but one site having old and tall trees. Ozone deposition velocity and ozone flux along with LH are simulated especially well by PX PSN as compared to significant PX Jarvis overestimation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Ran", "ForeName": "Limei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Pleim", "ForeName": "Jonathan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for the Environment, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Conghe", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for the Environment, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Band", "ForeName": "Larry", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "John T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for the Environment, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Binkowski", "ForeName": "Francis S", "Initials": "FS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Geophys Res Atmos", "NlmUniqueID": "9882986", "ISSNLinking": "2169-897X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Allison VJ, Miller RM, Jastrow JD, Matamala R, and Zak DR (2005), Changes in soil microbial community structure in a tallgrass prairie chronosequence, Soil Sci.
