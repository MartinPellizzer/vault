The incomplete understanding of atmospheric photochemical reaction mechanisms prevents us from accurately understanding the chemistry of O<sub>3</sub> production. Here, we used an improved dual-channel reaction chamber technique to measure net photochemical O<sub>3</sub> production rate (P(O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>net</sub>) directly in Dongguan, a typical industrial city in China. The maximum P(O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>net</sub> was 46.3 ppbv h<sup>-1</sup> during the observation period, which is at a relatively high level compared to previous observations under different environment worldwide. We employed an observation-based box model coupled with the state-of-the-art atmospheric chemical mechanism (MCM v3.3.1) to investigate the chemistry of O<sub>3</sub> production. Under the base scenario, the modelling underestimates P(O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>net</sub> by ~30\u202f%. Additionally considering HO<sub>2</sub> uptake by ambient aerosols, inorganic deposition, and Cl chemistry only caused a small change (< 13\u202f%) in the simulation of P(O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>net</sub>. Further analysis indicates that unmeasured reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as oxygenated VOCs and branched alkenes are potential contributors to the underestimation of P(O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>net</sub>. This study underscores the underestimation of P(O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>net</sub> in conventional atmospheric modelling setups, providing a crucial scientific foundation for further investigation aimed at promoting our understanding of photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
