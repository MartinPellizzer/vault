The effects of various operating parameters such as initial pH, rotational speed, gas-liquid ratio, ozone inlet concentration and reaction temperature on the degradation rate of methyl orange were studied with an aim to optimize the operation conditions. Results reveal that the degradation rate increased with an increase in rotational speed, gas-liquid ratio and ozone inlet concentration, and reached a maximum at 25 \u00b0C and initial pH 4. Contrast experiments involving ozone and ferrous ions (O3/Fe(2+)) were also carried out, and the results show approximately 10% higher degradation rate and COD removal in the O3/Fe(2+)/S2O8(2-) process than in the O3/Fe(2+) process. Additionally, the intermediates of the degradation process were analyzed to ascertain the degradation products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
