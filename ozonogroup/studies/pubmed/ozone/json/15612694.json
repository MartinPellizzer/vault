We demonstrate that the oxidation of organic films on water droplets could have large climatic effects in the atmosphere. We show that cloud-droplet growth and activation of cloud condensation nuclei (to become cloud droplets) is retarded by the presence of an organic film and that chemical oxidation of this film would allow a cloud droplet to grow, reducing cloud albedo by inducing precipitation, and would allow a cloud condensation nucleus to grow to a cloud droplet, thus forming a cloud and increasing the albedo of the Earth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geology, Royal Holloway University of London, Egham, Surrey TW20 0EX, U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "King", "ForeName": "Martin D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Katherine C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "Andrew D", "Initials": "AD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15612694", "10.1021/ja044717o"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
