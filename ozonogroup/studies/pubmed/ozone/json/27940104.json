However, inconsistent results have been reported, and no study has examined the critical exposure windows during pregnancy.", "We used Florida birth vital statistics records to investigate the association between HDP and O<sub>3</sub> exposure among 655,529 pregnancies with conception dates between 2005 and 2007. Individual O<sub>3</sub> exposure was assessed at mothers' home address at the time of delivery using the Hierarchical Bayesian space-time statistical model. We examined the association during three predefined exposure windows including trimester 1, trimester 2, and trimesters 1&2, as well as in each week of the first two trimesters using distributed lag models.", "Pregnancies with HDP had a higher mean exposure to O<sub>3</sub> (39.07 in trimester 1, 39.02 in trimester 2, and 39.06 in trimesters 1&2, unit: ppb) than those without HDP (38.65 in trimester 1, 38.57 in trimester 2, and 38.61 in trimesters 1&2, unit: ppb). In the adjusted logistic regression model, increased odds of HDP were observed for each 5 ppb increase in O<sub>3</sub> (OR<sub>Trimester1</sub>=1.04, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.06; OR<sub>Trimester2</sub>=1.03, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.04; OR<sub>Trimester1&2</sub>=1.07, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.08). In the distributed lag models, elevated odds of HDP were observed with increased O<sub>3</sub> exposure during the 1st to 24th weeks of gestation, with higher odds during early pregnancy.", "O<sub>3</sub> exposure during pregnancy is related to increased odds of HDP, and early pregnancy appears to be a potentially critical window of exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
