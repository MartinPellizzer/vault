However, there are no studies on its impact on ecosystems and possible enantioselectivity in ecotoxicity. This work aimed to evaluate: (i) the possible ecotoxicity of BTL as racemate or its isolated (R)- and (S)- enantiomers using Daphnia magna; and (ii) the efficiency of advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) in the removal of BTL and reduction of toxic effects caused by wastewaters. Enantiomers of BTL were obtained by liquid chromatography (LC) using a chiral semi-preparative column. Enantiomeric purity of each enantiomer was > 97 %. For toxicity assessment, a 9-day sub-chronic assay was performed with the racemate (at 0.10, 1.0 or 10 \u03bcg L<sup>-1</sup>) or each enantiomer (at 0.10 or 1.0 \u03bcg L<sup>-1</sup>). Changes in morphophysiological, behavioural, biochemical and reproductive endpoints were observed, which were dependent on the form of the substance and life stage of the organism (juvenile or adult). Removal rates of BTL in spiked wastewater (10 \u03bcg L<sup>-1</sup>) treated with different AOTs (ultraviolet, UV; ozonation, O<sub>3</sub>; and UV/O<sub>3</sub>) were similar and lower than 29 %. The 48 h D. magna acute toxicity assays demonstrated a reduction in the toxicity of the treated spiked effluents, but no differences were found amongst AOTs treatments. These results warn for the contamination and negative impact of BTL on ecosystems and highlight the need for efficient removal processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
