In this study, the ambient VOCs and OVOCs were intensively monitored at a roadside site in Hong Kong for one month during morning and evening rush hours. The emission characterizations, as well as ozone formation potentials (OFP) and hydroxyl radical (OH) loss rates (L<sub>OH</sub>) were determined. Results from the campaign showed that the average concentrations of detected VOCs/OVOCs ranged from 0.21 to 9.67 ppb, and higher toluene to benzene (T/B) ratio was observed during evening sections due to the variation of fuel types in vehicle fleets and mix of additional emission sources in this site. On average, OVOCs had much higher concentrations than the targeted VOC species. Acetone, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde were the three most abundant species, while formaldehyde showed the highest contributions to both OFP (32.20 %) and L<sub>OH</sub> (16.80 %). Furthermore, potential health hazards with inhalation exposure to formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), 1,3-butadiene, toluene, benzene, and acrylonitrile were found. These results reveal that it is imperative to implement efficient control measures to reduce vehicle emissions for both primary and secondary pollutants and to protect both roadside workers and pedestrians."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
