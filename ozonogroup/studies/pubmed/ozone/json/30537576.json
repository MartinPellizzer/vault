While it is well established that g<sub>m</sub> is decreased by stressors such as drought and high temperature, few studies have investigated if the phytotoxic air pollutant ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) affects g<sub>m</sub>. We quantified the relative importance of three different types of limitations of photosynthesis in poplar trees exposed to elevated O<sub>3</sub>: decreases in stomatal conductance, g<sub>m</sub> and biochemical photosynthetic capacity. The O<sub>3</sub>-induced reductions in light-saturated net photosynthesis were linked to significant declines in g<sub>m</sub> and biochemical photosynthetic capacity (in particular carboxylation). There was no significant effect of O<sub>3</sub> on stomatal conductance. Of the O<sub>3</sub>-induced limitations on photosynthesis, g<sub>m</sub> limitation was by far the most important (-16%) while biochemical limitation (-8%) was rather small. Both limitations grew in magnitude over the study period and varied in response to leaf-specific O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Our findings suggest that declines in g<sub>m</sub> may play a key role in limiting photosynthesis of plants exposed to elevated O<sub>3</sub>, an effect hitherto overlooked."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
