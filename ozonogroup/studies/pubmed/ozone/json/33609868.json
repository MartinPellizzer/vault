However, given the complex interaction of PAHs with sludge extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), effective sludge disintegration is required to make PAHs more accessible to oxidants, which also affects PAHs partitioning. Here, we investigated two treatment systems, namely ozonation (ozone) and sequential hydrodynamic cavitation and ozonation (HC+ozone), under varied conditions, to determine whether the extent of sludge disintegration can estimate a measurable removal of PAHs. The results showed that both the PAHs removal efficiency and kinetics highly depended on pH and ozone dose. Although no significant removal of PAHs occurred during HC treatment, the observed rate constants for \u03a3<sub>16</sub> PAHs removal in HC+ozone system were 1.2-1.4-fold higher than those obtained in ozone system under the same condition. The accelerated PAHs removal could be attributed to the reduced flocs size (80% smaller) and increased soluble EPS concentration (5-fold higher) with HC pretreatment. Lastly, a positive correlation was noted between the PAHs removal efficiency and soluble EPS concentration (R<sup>2</sup> =\u00a00.85), indicating the important role of dissolved and colloidal matter (DCM) for PAHs partitioning between aqueous and particulate phases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
