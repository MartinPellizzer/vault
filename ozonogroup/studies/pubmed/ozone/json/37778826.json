Samples were collected by canisters and analyzed by GC-MS-FID. The species profiles of VOCs emitted from sources were obtained. Results showed that xylenes, ethylbenzene, acetone and dichloromethane were the characteristics species for painting, 2-propanol and ethyl acetate for printing, \u03b1-pinene for solid wood furniture manufacturing, and 2-butanone for biscuit baking. These characteristics species could be as tracers for the sources respectively. In most of samples from the solvent use, the benzene/toluene (B/T) ratio was less than 0.3, indicating that the ratio could be as the indicator for tracing the solvent use related sources. The results also suggested that the toluene/xylene (T/X) ratio be as the indicator to distinguish the VOCs sources of painting (<2) from the printing (>2). Aromatics contributed the most to ozone formation potential (OFP) of most painting and non-paper printing sources, and oxygen-containing VOCs (OVOCs) were major species contributing to OFP of the sources from food production and paper printing. The OFP of the VOCs emissions from vehicle in tunnels and from other manufactures were dominated by both aromatics and alkenes. The \u03b1-pinene could explain 56.94% and 32.54% of total OFP of the VOCs sources from filing cabinet and solid wood furniture manufacturing, which was rarely been involved in previous studies of VOCs source profiles, indicating that the species of concern for VOCs sources are still insufficient at present."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
