With the technology development of hydraulic fracking, the United States experienced a shale gas boom in the last decade while the public raised concerns about the potential health impacts of co-emitted VOCs and other airborne pollutants. National Energy Technology Laboratory conducted stationary trailer-based ambient monitoring to study the sources of VOCs in Maryland, where the state enacted a moratorium on unconventional natural gas extraction. The campaign had two periods, May to August 2014 (summer) and November 2014 to February 2015 (winter). Ethane was the most abundant VOC, averaging 12.3\u00a0ppb (SD\u00a0=\u00a015.7\u00a0ppb) in summer and 21.7\u00a0ppb (SD\u00a0=\u00a021.6\u00a0ppb) in winter. The seasonal variation of VOCs indicated different source strengths. The sampling region was in the nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) limited regime for O<sub>3</sub> production, and the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were sensitive to VOC/NO<sub>x</sub> ratios in the early mornings. We derived a six-factor profile using positive matrix factorization: motor vehicles, industrial, biogenics, coal burning, fugitive and evaporative, and ozone secondary. The fugitive and evaporative factor explained 44.5% of total VOCs, and the motor vehicles factor followed second with 15.5%. Oil and gas activities had a considerable impact on the abundance of VOCs in this region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
