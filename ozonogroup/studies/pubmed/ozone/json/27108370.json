Magnetic pyrite cinder (PyC), which was employed as the catalyst in our investigation, was further deposited by Ce (Ce-PyC) to enhance its catalytic activity in the degradation of aqueous reactive black 5 (RB5). The results showed that additional 17.39%, 42.12% mineralization efficiency was obtained by O3/PyC, O3/Ce-PyC, respectively, in the degradation of RB5 compared to that of O3 alone under identical experimental condition. The reaction mechanism involved the enhanced mineralization of aqueous RB5 at the catalyst-solution interface via hydroxyl radicals produced by the reaction between O3 and catalyst surface. Besides surface hydroxyl, surface Ce(\u2162) was crucial for Ce-PyC in the enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals. More surprisingly, it was found that both PyC and Ce-PyC could exert quite stable catalytic activity in a wide pH range from 3 to 10, which was supposed to be combined with inherently comprised various metal oxide, such as Fe2O3, Fe3O4, MnO2 and CuO. Ozone utilization evaluation demonstrated that PyC and Ce-PyC facilitated effective ozone decomposition, as ozone utilization efficiency (mgTOC/mgO3) of O3/PyC and O3/Ce-PyC increased 64.0%, 155.0%, respectively, compared to that of O3 alone. This investigation provided an effective alternative in the resource utilization of PyC, which was traditionally characterized as a waste material."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
