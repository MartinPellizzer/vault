We aimed to assess the effects of short-term air pollution exposure to the clinical course of IPF.", "IPF patients were followed intensively for four nonconsecutive study periods between 13 July 2020 and 5 September 2021. Short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations was estimated using spatio-temporal land use regression models. Associations among symptoms, lung function, oxygen saturation, and short-term personal air pollutant exposure were assessed through multiple mixed effects logistic regression models.", "Data for up to 24 IPF patients (mean age: 72.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6\u2009years) were analyzed. We detected positive significant associations between cough and a 10\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in same day mean level of NO<sub>2</sub> (OR\u2009=\u20091.59, 95%CI: 1.00-2.53), PM<sub>10</sub> (OR\u2009=\u20092.42, 95%CI: 1.54-3.79), and O<sub>3</sub> (OR\u2009=\u20091.63, 95%CI: 1.14-2.32). A 10\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in same day mean level of NO<sub>2</sub> was also associated with the risk of appearance of wheezing (OR\u2009=\u20093.01, 95%CI: 1.00-9.04), while exposure to O<sub>3</sub> was associated with common cold (OR\u2009=\u20096.30, 95%CI: 3.59-11.07).
