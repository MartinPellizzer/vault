Animals were sacrificed at 3, 5, 7, or 14 d after the onset of exposure, and samples of plasma and lung lavage were obtained. Heat-inactivated plasma and lavage from animals exposed to ozone for 5 or 7 d significantly increased DNA synthesis by lung pneumocytes compared with plasma or lavage from air-exposed animals. Fractionation of plasma and lavage samples indicated that the factor responsible had an isoelectric point of 6.45-6.75, and a molecular weight of 38 +/- 3 kDa. This factor has a dose-dependent effect on lung pneumocyte DNA synthesis in culture. It has no effect on cultured fibroblast DNA synthesis, and is distinct from a previously described factor in the plasma of these ozone-exposed animals that enhances fibroblast DNA synthesis. The factor is detectable within 5 d of exposure, and may hold some promise as a marker of early oxidant lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Anatomy, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanswell", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fraher", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grose", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Focusing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2299685", "10.1080/15287399009531377"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
