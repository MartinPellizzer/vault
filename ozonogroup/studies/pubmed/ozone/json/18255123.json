Experiments were performed for several days almost every month from January 2002 to April 2004. Gaseous hydroperoxide was collected in aqueous solution and determined by HPLC-fluorescence method. In general, the higher levels of H(2)O(2) were found in warm and humid air with high ozone concentrations, but lower concentrations of SO(2), NO(2), CO and PM(10). For two-year measurements, seasonal factor was the most dominant and the concentrations of H(2)O(2) were highest in summer, for which the median, mean, and upper 90% values were 0.53 ppbv, 0.81 ppbv, and 1.61 ppbv, respectively. In highly polluted metropolitan Seoul, the photochemical activity controlling H(2)O(2) variations was seemingly more sensitive to meteorological conditions than the level of chemical pollutants. It was mainly due to high emissions of pollutants, particularly NOx, which was demonstrated by the occasional occurrence of CH(3)OOH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Korea University, South Korea. meehye@korea.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Meehye", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Joo-Ae", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Young-Mi", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Gangwoong", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18255123", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.11.037", "S0048-9697(07)01274-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
