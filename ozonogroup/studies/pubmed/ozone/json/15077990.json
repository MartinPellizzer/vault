A technical plant for treatment of paper mill wastewater started operation in 1999. Advanced oxidation treatment is defined here as a combination of chemical and biochemical oxidation applied to a completely biodegraded effluent. The process is a combination of ozonation with following biodegradation in a biofilm reactor. The combination makes use of the effect of partial oxidation in which with reduced use of expensive chemical oxidants persistent COD becomes biodegradable. A far-reaching elimination of AOX, colour and other disturbing substances like complexing agents is achieved simultaneously. The partially oxidized compounds, now biodegradable, are eliminated in a following biofilm reactor. Using single-stage systems, COD elimination rates of up to 60% are achieved with 0.4 to 1.0 g ozone per g COD eliminated in the combined process. With a two-stage system COD elimination of 85% with 0.65 g/g has been achieved in pilot tests. The quality of the treated effluent suits fresh water requirements for most types of paper production, so that either a total closure of the water circuits or - due to increasing concentrations of electrolytes, which are not eliminated by this process - a substantial closure to about 20% of the original amount of fresh water can be achieved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CM Consult Dr. Christian H.
