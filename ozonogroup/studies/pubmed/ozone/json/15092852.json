Changes in the annual mean and percentiles of the daily 1-h maximum and other hour-based concentrations varied according to the compound and city type. Seasonal variations varied according to the compound, yet not with the city type. Both Seoul and Taegu exhibited lower O(3) concentrations in July compared to other summer months. There was a high degree of correlation between the daily 1- and 8-h maximum or daily mean concentrations of all compounds in both cities, with an R(2) of 0.66-0.90 at p<0.0001. It was indicated that for CO and O(3), the 8-h standard was more stringent than the 1-h standard, while for NO(2) and SO(2), the 1-h standard was more stringent than the 24-h standard. The correlation coefficients between the daily 1-h maximum and daily mean concentrations decreased as the maximum concentration values of NO(2), O(3 ), and SO(2) increased in the two cities. For all the target compounds, Seoul recorded a substantially higher frequency of days with concentrations above the relevant 1-, 8-, and 24-h standards compared to Taegu."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Sankeok-dong, Bukgu, Taegu 702-701, South Korea. wkjo@kyungpook.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jo", "ForeName": "W K", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "I H", "Initials": "IH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nam", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092852", "10.1016/s0269-7491(99)00284-5", "S0269-7491(99)00284-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
