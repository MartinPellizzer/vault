Recently, interest has grown regarding the application of ozonated oil for vascular leg ulcer treatment. The efficacy of an innovative spray formulation of ozonated oil and \u03b1-bisabolol combination in the topical treatment of chronic venous leg ulcers was evaluated compared with standard epithelialization cream.", "A randomized controlled trial was conducted.", "A total of 29 patients older than 18 years with chronic venous leg ulcers for less than 2 years' duration were assessed.", "Patients were randomized to receive daily application of both ozonated oil and \u03b1-bisabolol or the control cream (vitamin A, vitamin E, talc, and zinc oxide) for 30 days.", "Patients were evaluated on 4 different visits: at days 0, 7, 14, and 30. At each visit, the wound surfaces were measured. Wound area ratio and the speed of ulcer healing were calculated.", "At the end of treatment, the proportion of patients with complete ulcer healing was higher with ozonated oil and \u03b1-bisabolol formulation (25% vs 0%). Furthermore, the changes in ulcer surface area were significant for ozonated oil and \u03b1-bisabolol formulation only (P < .05), in particular, observing a significant and progressive reduction of the wound surface by 34%, 59%, and 73%, after 7, 14, and 30 days of treatment, respectively.", "The innovative spray formulation of ozonated oil and \u03b1-bisabolol combination shows promise as an important new therapeutic option in the adjuvant treatment of venous ulcers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laura Gheuc\u0103 Solov\u0103stru, MD, PhD, is Associate Professor, Dermatology Department, Grigore T.
