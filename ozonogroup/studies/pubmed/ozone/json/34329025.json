Thus, piezoelectric ozonation processes driven by hydraulic (HPE-O<sub>3</sub>) and ultrasonic (UPE-O<sub>3</sub>) forces were compared systematically, using BaTiO<sub>3</sub> as piezoelectric material for ibuprofen (IBP) degradation. The synergy indexes of HPE-O<sub>3</sub> and UPE-O<sub>3</sub> processes were 4.51 and 5.78, respectively. Besides, UPE-O<sub>3</sub> process (88.84%) achieved better mineralization efficiency than HPE-O<sub>3</sub> process (68.80%) in 90\u00a0min. Nevertheless, the energy consumptions of HPE-O<sub>3</sub> process was only 4.01\u2030 of UPE-O<sub>3</sub> process. The formation rate and concentration of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH (the dominant active species in both processes) in UPE-O<sub>3</sub> process were 2-3 times higher than that in HPE-O<sub>3</sub> process. Notably, piezoelectric potential and current density driven by ultrasound were approximately 47500-fold and 40-fold than those by hydro-energy, respectively. These led to the difference of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH paths between HPE-O<sub>3</sub> and UPE-O<sub>3</sub> processes. Further analyses indicated that <sup>\u2022</sup>OH was mainly generated by single-electron transfer without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in HPE-O<sub>3</sub> process, whereas both single- and double-electron transfer (with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation) contributed to the production of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH in UPE-O<sub>3</sub> process. This study revealed the mechanism of piezoelectric ozonation process with different driven approaches and may provide valuable reference for selection of driven approaches in piezocatalytic study and application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
