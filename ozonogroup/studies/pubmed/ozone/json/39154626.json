Oocytes were cultured in four distinct concentrations of NZS (0.5, 1, 2, and 5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and parthenogenetically activated. The rates of oocytes arrested at the Germinal Vesicle (GV), Germinal Vesicle Breakdown (GVBD), Metaphase I (MI), and Metaphase II (MII) stages were statistically different among groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The oocytes cultured in 1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL NZS yielded the best oocyte maturation rate at the MI and MII stages; however, the lowest maturation and high degeneration rates were observed in Group E. The measurements of Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced Glutathione (GSH), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), and Ferric Reducing/Antioxidant Power assay (FRAP) were performed from IVM culture media. No statistical difference was observed in SOD and MDA results (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). GSH levels were statistically significant between Group A-Group E (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), Group B-Group E (p\u00a0=\u00a00.045), and Group E-Group D (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). The culture media in Group D and Group E had high FRAP concentrations and significantly differed between groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CDK1, and cyclin B1 genes, which are subunits of maturation-promoting factor (MPF), are upregulated in Group B and Group C, while are downregulated in oocytes of Group E. This study showed that low, controlled doses of NZS (1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) supplementation could improve the meiotic competence of canine oocytes and lead to positive response in expressions of CDK1 and cyclin B1 on the gene level."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.
