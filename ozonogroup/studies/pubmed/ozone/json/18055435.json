The trees were measured for gas exchange, leaf size, date of leaf abscission, size and biochemical characteristics of the overwintering buds and early leaf development during the 8th-9th year of free-air CO(2) and O(3) exposure at the Aspen FACE site located near Rhinelander, WI. Net photosynthesis was enhanced 49-73% by elevated [CO(2)], and decreased 13-30% by elevated [O(3)]. Elevated [CO(2)] delayed, and elevated [O(3)] tended to accelerate, leaf abscission in autumn. Elevated [CO(2)] increased the ratio of monosaccharides to di- and oligosaccharides in aspen buds, which may indicate a lag in cold acclimation. The total carbon concentration in overwintering buds was unaffected by the treatments, although elevated [O(3)] decreased the amount of starch by 16% in birch buds, and reduced the size of aspen buds, which may be related to the delayed leaf development in aspen during the spring. Elevated [CO(2)] generally ameliorated the effects of elevated [O(3)]. Our results show that both elevated [CO(2)] and elevated [O(3)] have the potential to alter carbon metabolism of overwintering buds. These changes may cause carry-over effects during the next growing season."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, FIN-70211, Kuopio, Finland. johanna.riikonen@uku.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riikonen", "ForeName": "Johanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kets", "ForeName": "Katre", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Darbah", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oksanen", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sober", "ForeName": "Anu", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vapaavuori", "ForeName": "Elina", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubiske", "ForeName": "Mark E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nelson", "ForeName": "Neil", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karnosky", "ForeName": "David F", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clone Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18055435", "10.1093/treephys/28.2.243"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
