The main objective of this study was to determine by nasal lavage (NAL) the acute inflammatory nasal influx elicited in these children upon exposure to three different polluted days. Ozone, the main criteria pollutant for SWMMC, varied both in the number of hours above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), which is 0.12 ppm as a 1-h maximum concentration not to be exceeded more than once per year, and in the maximal concentrations in the preceding three NAL sampling dates. Nasal neutrophilic influx, the surface expression of the B2 integrin CD11b on the nasal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), rhinoscopic findings, respiratory symptoms, and nasal cytologies were evaluated in the 38 exposed children and in the 28 control children living in a nonpolluted Pacific coast port. SWMMC children had an average daily outdoor exposure of 7.7 h and complained of nasal mucus secretion, epistaxis, intermittent nasal obstruction, diurnal cough episodes, and chest discomfort. Nasal mucosal atrophy by rhinoscopy was present in 37/38, and all children had an abnormal nasal cytology. Exposed children had significantly higher nasal PMNs and nasal PMN-CD11b expression than controls. PMN median values in exposed children were higher than controls on all sampling dates (November 12, p < .001; November 17, p < .001; and November 24, p < .00001). Interestingly, a lower nasal neutrophilic response (p < .0004) was recorded in the SWMMC children 18 h after exposure to the highest O3 concentrations (up to 0.307 ppm) and the largest number of hours with O3 > 0.12 ppm (7 h). The question of a competing inflammatory response at the bronchioalveolar level with structural damage is raised. These NAL findings underscore the need to restrict outdoor activity in SWMMC children during the months of greater potential exposure to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Nacional de Pediatr\u00eda, Experimental Pathology Section, Mexico City, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodriguez-Alcaraz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ram\u00edrez", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barragan", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7643430", "10.1080/15287399509532006"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
