Here, we assess the magnitude of such errors at two Finnish locations, during May and June, under three cloud conditions. First we simulated solar radiation spectra for normal, compared with 10% and 20% ozone depletion, and convoluted the daily integrated solar spectra with eight biological spectral weighting functions (BSWFs) of relevance to effects of UV on plants. We also convoluted a measured spectrum from cellulose-acetate filtered UV-B lamps with the same eight BSWFs. From these intermediate results we calculated the enhancement errors. Differences between locations and months were small, cloudiness had only a minor effect. This assessment was based on the assumption that no extra enhancement compensating for shading of UV radiation by lamp frames is performed. Under this assumption errors between spectra are due to differences in the UV-B effectiveness rather than differences in the UV-A effectiveness. Hence, conclusions about plant growth from past UV-supplementation experiments should be valid. However, interpretation of the response of individual physiological processes is less secure, so results from some field experiments with lamps might need reassessment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2010 The Authors.
