However, the current research on the synergistic relationship between the two still needs to be further explored. Using the Geodetector model, we analyzed the effects of meteorology and emissions on fine particulate matter and ozone concentrations over the \"2\u00a0+\u00a026\" cities at multiple timescales, and also explored the coupling relationship between the two pollutants. Fine particulate matter concentrations showed overall decreasing trends on inter-season and inter-annual scale from 2015 to 2021, whereas ozone concentrations showed overall increasing trends. While ozone concentrations displayed an inverted U-shaped distribution from month to month, fine particulate matter concentrations displayed a U-shaped fluctuation. On inter-annual scale, climatic factors, with planet boundary layer height as the main determinant, have higher effects for both pollutants than human precursors. In summer and autumn, sunshine duration had the most influence on fine particulate matter, while planet boundary layer height was the greatest factor in winter. Fine particulate matter is the leading impacting factor on ozone concentrations in summer, and there were positive associations between them on both annual and seasonal scale. The impact of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds for both pollutants concentrations varied significantly between seasons. The two pollutants concentration were enhanced by the interactions between the various components. On inter-annual scale, interactions between the planet boundary layer height and other factors dominated the concentrations of the two pollutants, whereas in summer, interactions between fine particulate matter and other factors dominated the concentrations of ozone. The study has implications for the treatment of atmospheric pollution in China and other nations and can serve as an important reference for the creation of integrated atmospheric pollution regulation policies over the \"2\u00a0+\u00a026\" cities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
