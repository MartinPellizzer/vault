Consequently, technologies for pesticide abatement in food and water remain in focus. Cold plasma is an emerging decontamination technology, that is being increasingly explored for the abatement of agrochemical and pesticide residue in food and water. In some cases, rapid and complete degradation of pesticide residues has come to light. Such promising results encourage exploring scale-up and commercialization. To achieve this, unraveling mechanisms involved in plasma decontamination and the nature of degradation products is needed. The present review identifies the mechanisms involved in plasma- assisted removal of pesticide residues from food and water, draws parallels with mechanism of ozone and ultraviolet technologies, investigates the chemistry of the intermediates and degradates, and identifies some future research needs. The review recognizes that mechanisms involved in plasma processes have overlapping similarities to those identified for ozone and ultraviolet light, involving oxidation by hydroxyl radical and photo-oxidation. The toxicity of intermediates and degradates in plasma processing have not received much attention. The safety aspects of end products form plasma led degradation of pesticides should be considered for practical exploitation. Identification of intermediates and degradation products, recognition of most potent plasma species, understanding the influence of co-existing entities, the energy efficiency of plasma reactors, and the process economics deserve research focus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
