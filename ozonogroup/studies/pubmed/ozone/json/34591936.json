Road transport is a major source producing the largest amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) (as a secondary pollutant). Hundreds of vehicles enter and exit the Tidworth Camp's main gate daily, potentially producing these pollutants. However, the air pollution exposure experienced by personnel on guard duty is unknown. This study aimed to determine and compare background NO2 and O3 levels experienced by personnel on guard duty.", "Cross-sectional data was collected using a static sampling technic on randomly selected days of the week. Data analysis was done using IBM-SPSS-26 and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "The background concentration of NO2 and O3 pollutants were within recommended limits. There was no significant difference between mean morning and afternoon exposure levels for both pollutants. However, NO2 and O3 levels were significantly higher during weekdays compared to weekends (M = -0.022, SD = 0.007, t(6) = -8.672, p <0.0001 and M = -0.016, SD = 0.008, t(6) = -5.040, p = 0.002 respectively). Both pollutants showed no significant differences in exposure levels when only weekdays were compared. NO2 levels showed a weak positive correlation during weekdays (r = 0.04) and a strong positive correlation during weekends (r = 0.96). O3 levels had a positive correlation on both weekdays and weekends; however, levels on Monday showed a negative correlation (r = -0.55). Linear regression analysis showed that outside temperature was a significant predictor of O3 levels (p = 0.026).", "Personnel on guard duty experienced higher pollution levels during weekdays compared to weekends; however, air pollution levels for both pollutants were within recommended limits. Further studies are recommended over hotter months using a personal sampling technic to measure personal air pollution exposure levels in order to minimise any health and safety risks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5734-9690"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Defence Medical Academy, Defence Medical Services (DMS), Whittington, United Kingdom."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, United Kingdom."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Collaboration for Research Excellence in Africa (CORE Africa), Douala, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Niba Rawlings", "ForeName": "Ngwa", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Collaboration for Research Excellence in Africa (CORE Africa), Douala, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ambe", "ForeName": "Akwah Emmanuela", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Collaboration for Research Excellence in Africa (CORE Africa), Douala, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ngongalah", "ForeName": "Lem", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Military Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Defra.
