The textural properties, water-holding capacity, cooking loss rate and color of the chicken egg yolk gel (CEYG) were significantly improved after ozonation. The maximum hardness value (976.04\u00a0g) was reached at 20\u00a0min of ozonation and it was 134.92\u00a0g higher than that of the natural group. Additionally, the ozone-treated yolk showed an increase of 58.47% in carbonyl content and a decrease of 44.33% in free sulfhydryl groups. The results of low-field nuclear magnetic resonance indicated that ozone promoted the conversion of free water to non-flowing water in the CEYG. Scanning electron microscopy represented that the moderate ozone treatment resulted in a more regular, continuous and smooth network structure of the CEYG. These results provided a theoretical basis for the application of ozone to improve the performance of heat-induced CEYG."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
