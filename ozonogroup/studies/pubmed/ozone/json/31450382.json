The content of the effluents was analysed in terms carbon disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, and di-tert-butyl disulfide concentration. A possibility of complete oxidation of sulfides by cavitation alone as well as by its combination with external oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone or peroxone was demonstrated. The oxidation time for the most effective processes is as little as 15\u202fmin. Due to the presence of sulfide ions, the effluents from the production of bitumens were oxidized at a strongly alkaline pH. The results of this study reveal the advantage of performing advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) at a basic pH. The effective degradation of sulfide ions enables performance of further degradation of organic contaminants at an acidic pH, ensuring high efficiency of treatment based, for example, on the Fenton reaction without the risk of release of hydrogen sulfide to the atmosphere. The results of this research are applicable to all kinds of caustic effluents for which the lack of possibility of pH adjustment limits their efficient treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
