We developed a miniature, low power, low cost, and wide-temperature-range (-40 to +85 \u00b0C) photometric O<sub>3</sub> sensor for continuous and in-situ ambient O<sub>3</sub> monitoring. The primary innovation in this sensor is the combination of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) with unbalanced differential optical measurement with algorithm correction, sensitive electronic module, and 3D printing fabrication. The sensor operated in the Hartley band of O<sub>3</sub> with a UV-LED (258\u00a0nm, 1mw) and software phase-sensitive detection. Experimental results showed high performance of the sensor with detection limit of 8\u00a0ppb and relative error of 0.22%. The dimension, power, and weight of the sensor are as low as 11.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.4\u00a0cm, 0.5\u00a0W, and 0.1\u00a0kg, respectively, much lower than that of most O<sub>3</sub> sensors. We also demonstrated the feasibility of the sensor in continuously O<sub>3</sub> monitoring in an office."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
