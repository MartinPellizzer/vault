They were randomly divided into three groups of 30 specimens each according to the immersion solutions used, i.e., tea, cola or artificial saliva. Each group was further subdivided into three equal subgroups (n = 10) according to the type of whitening treatment applied; 30% carbamide peroxide, ozonated KY gel or polishing paste. Colour and surface roughness was measured at baseline, after immersion, also following whitening procedures by using a stereomicroscope. The results were recorded, tabulated and statistically analysed.", "The colour values of artificial saliva displayed the highest statistically significant mean colour difference compared to cola and tea. However, there was no statistically significant difference in surface roughness. Also, a superior whitening effect was demonstrated with ozonated gel. Ozonated gel showed statistically significant lowest roughness compared to both carbamide peroxide and polishing paste.", "Immersion solutions have a positive influence on the colour of resin composite. Also, ozonated gel is an efficient bleaching agent with the least adverse effect on surface roughness."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2010 Australian Dental Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "El Seka El Haded Hospital, Cairo, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abd Elhamid", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mosallam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust Dent J", "NlmUniqueID": "0370612", "ISSNLinking": "0045-0421"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heliomolar"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyurethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saliva, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31PZ2VAU81", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamide Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbamide Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cola"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Polishing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyurethanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saliva, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21133937", "10.1111/j.1834-7819.2010.01259.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
