Ozonation and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are widely used to remove TrOCs in wastewater treatment process. Owing to the trace concentrations of TrOCs in wastewater, real-time monitoring of the abatement efficiency of TrOCs through ozonation and UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is quite challenging. Instead of a direct measurement of all the TrOCs, the research community has begun to use different surrogates to monitor the attenuation of TrOCs during AOPs. Various surrogates have been developed over the past few decades. In this review, the different types of surrogates are summarized, including ultraviolet spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Strong linear correlations have been found for the removal of TrOCs using AOPs, and the abatement of UV absorption spectroscopy at 254 nm or total fluorescence (TF). Moreover, a two-phase linear correlation can better describe the ozone-resistant TrOCs compared with a single linear correlation. Two different kinds of predictive models exist that use surrogates as the input for ozonation: the regression model and kinetic model. The development of the models requires a further understanding of the impacts of water quality, seasonal variations, and storm events on the kinetic parameters. For the in situ monitoring system, the light-emitting diode (LED) is one of the most promising light sources, although the sensitivity and accuracy still need to be improved."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
