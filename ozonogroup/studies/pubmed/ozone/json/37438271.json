Further investigation has indicated that the relevant studies of O<sub>3</sub> are insufficient. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the key driving factors of O<sub>3</sub> variations for government regulators. In this study, a combined method consisting of a generalized additive model (GAM), empirical orthogonal function (EOF), and absolute principal component scores (APCs) model was employed to identify and quantify the impacts of meteorology and local photochemical generation (local) and that transported from outside (nonlocal) on O<sub>3</sub> variations from 2018-2020. Simultaneously, the driving factors of O<sub>3</sub> annual values from 2018 to 2019 and from 2019 to 2020 in Changsha were analyzed. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> episodes were commonly caused by meteorology when the relative contribution from precursors was high, on the short-term time scale. Overall, on the temporal scale, meteorology and local were the driving factors for the increasing annual O<sub>3</sub> from 2018 to 2019. Additionally, the contribution from meteorology, local, and nonlocal decreased from 2019 to 2020, leading to a lower level of O<sub>3</sub> concentration in 2020. Geographically, the east, north, and south of Changsha were mainly affected by meteorology, local, and nonlocal, respectively. Throughout the three years, nonlocal exhibited a sustained decreasing trend, whereas the tendencies from meteorology and local varied by year and geography. Local contribution in the north of Changsha increased from 2018 to 2019, which was likely attributed to the increasing biogenic volatile organic compound emission (BVOCs), and it became lower in the south owing to the strengthened consumption by NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>. Impacts from meteorology on O<sub>3</sub> in all sites were enhanced from 2018 to 2019. By contrast, local contribution decreased in the north and increased in the south with the decline in BVOC and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions from 2019 to 2020, when the meteorological impacts on O<sub>3</sub> in the whole area became weak."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Center of Ecological Environmental Monitoring and Analysis (South China Sea Research Center of Ecological Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation), South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lei-Feng", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Changsha 410014, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Center of Ecological Environmental Monitoring and Analysis (South China Sea Research Center of Ecological Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation), South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Dan-Ping", "Initials": "DP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Changsha 410014, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Yan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Changsha 410014, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Changsha 410014, China."}], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Zi-Bing", "Initials": "ZB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37438271", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202207262"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
