The complex nonattainment pollution of O<sub><i>x</i></sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> is defined as the daily average mass concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and daily maximum 8 h average (O<sub>3</sub> MDA8) mass concentration of O<sub>3</sub> simultaneously that exceeds the Chinese grade \u2161 national air quality standard. The characteristics and meteorological factors that influence the complex nonattainment pollution of O<sub><i>x</i></sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> at different types of areas were analyzed. The results indicate that from 2013 to 2017, the annual average mass concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region decreased from (44\u00b17) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> to (32\u00b14) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, which met the annual standard for three consecutive years. The annual average mass concentration of O<sub><i>x</i></sub> decreased from (127\u00b114) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in 2013 to (114\u00b112) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in 2016 and then showed a general rebound trend to (129\u00b113) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in 2017 when O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased significantly (10 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>). The proportion of pollution processes with O<sub>3</sub> as the primary pollutant increased from 33% in 2013 to 78% in 2017, and the regional characteristics of simultaneous pollution in multiple cities have been highlighted. The complex nonattainment pollution of O<sub><i>x</i></sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> occurred 60 times during the study period, primarily in urban sites (78%) and suburban sites (22%). The largest number of days of complex nonattainment pollution occurred in autumn (52%) because of strong solar radiation that was conducive to ozone formation, and consequently, the high oxidization of the atmosphere promoted the secondary generation of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The weather conditions that caused the complex nonattainment pollution in the PRD mainly include outflow-high-pressures (43%), subtropical-high-pressures(30%), and tropical-depressions (27%). In terms of specific meteorological conditions, when the temperature was in the range of 20-25\u2103 and relative humidity was in the range of 60%-75%, the proportion of complex nonattainment pollution was the highest (22%). When O<sub>3</sub> pollution was substantial, the high relative humidity and low wind speed during the nighttime caused the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> to rise significantly, and then the high temperatures during the day aggravated the complex nonattainment pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Feng-Hua", "Initials": "FH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wei-Hua", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei-Wen", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Bu-Qing", "Initials": "BQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Jing-Ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Tu-Shi", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510443, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Environmental Monitoring Center, Shenzhen 518049, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chan-Fang", "Initials": "CF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33742795", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202007286"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
