The new fuel was designed to further decrease emissions of hydrocarbons (HC<sub>s</sub>), oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and other toxic species. In addition, it was formulated to reduce the ozone-forming potential of the HCs emitted by vehicles. Previous studies have observed that emissions from on-road vehicles can differ significantly from those predicted by mobile source emissions models, and so it is important to quantify the change in emissions in a real-world setting. In October 1995, prior to the introduction of California Phase 2 RFG, the Desert Research Institute (DRI) performed a study of vehicle emissions in Los Angeles' Sepulveda Tunnel. This study provided a baseline against which the results of a second experiment, conducted in July 1996, could be compared to evaluate the impact of California Phase 2 RFG on emissions from real-world vehicles. Compared with the 1995 experiment, CO and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions exhibited statistically significant decreases, while the decrease in non-methane hydrocarbon emissions was not statistically significant. Changes in the speciated HC emissions were evaluated. The benzene emission rate decreased by 27% and the overall emission rate of aromatic compounds decreased by 22% comparing the runs with similar speeds. Emissions of alkenes were virtually unchanged; however, emissions of combustion related unsaturates (e.g., acetylene, ethene) increased, while heavier alkenes decreased. The emission rate of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) exhibited a larger increase. Overall changes in the ozone-forming potential of the emissions were not significantly different, with the increased contributions to reactivity from paraffins, ole-fins, and MTBE being offset by a large decrease in reactivity due to aromatics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Desert Research Institute, Energy and Environmental Engineering Center , Reno , Nevada , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gertler", "ForeName": "Alan W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Desert Research Institute, Energy and Environmental Engineering Center , Reno , Nevada , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sagebiel", "ForeName": "John C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Desert Research Institute, Energy and Environmental Engineering Center , Reno , Nevada , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dippel", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Desert Research Institute, Energy and Environmental Engineering Center , Reno , Nevada , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Connor", "ForeName": "C Michael", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28072372", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463965"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
