This study performs a streamlined life cycle assessment (LCA) of a coal-fired plant in South Africa. The cradle-to-grave LCA focuses on the coal cycle to determine hotspots with high environmental impacts in the process. Four impact categories were considered in this study: global warming potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, eutrophication potential, and acidification potential. Coal transportation, coal pulverization, water use, and ash management were identified as hotspots in the coal cycle. The coal process has 95% potential for global warming, 4% potential for eutrophication, 1% potential for acidification, and a negligible percentage for photochemical ozone creation. Susceptibility to climate change, eutrophication, acid rain, soil degradation, and water contamination among others are major concerns of the coal cycle. Outsourcing coal from nearby mines with train as medium of transportation reduces environmental impact. Similarly, the use of mitigation technologies like flue gas desulphurization, carbon capture storage, or selective catalytic reduction will reduce the concentration of the flue gas emitted. Ultimately, substituting the coal process with renewable energy sources will ensure environmental sustainability in South Africa. This study will serve as a good resource for further studies on LCA of coal power plants not only in other African countries but in other developing countries with similar situation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mount Royal University Calgary, Calgary, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dunmade", "ForeName": "Israel", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering Science, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madushele", "ForeName": "Nkosinathi", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering Science, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa. pauladedeji2k5@gmail.com."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2212-0623"], "LastName": "Adedeji", "ForeName": "Paul A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering Science, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akinlabi", "ForeName": "Esther T", "Initials": "ET"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31049866", "10.1007/s11356-019-05227-6", "10.1007/s11356-019-05227-6"]}}]}
