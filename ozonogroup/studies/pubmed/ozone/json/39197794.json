Previous studies on Tropospheric Column Ozone (TCO) have primarily concentrated on specific regions or global geographic divisions. This has led to insufficient exploration of the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of TCO in global and rational subregions. In this study, TCO is calculated using the Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data and corrected using satellite data. Cluster analysis is conducted to explore the temporal characteristics of TCO variations in different regions. The results show that the global TCO is basically distributed latitudinally, with higher TCO in the northern hemisphere, which is related to atmospheric circulation, radiation, stratospheric transport, and the distribution of ozone precursors. Between 1980 and Ma, 2020, the global average annual TCO showed an increasing trend at 0.09 DU yr<sup>-1</sup> due to rising anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors (NO<sub>x</sub> at 589547.86\u202ft\u202fyr<sup>-1</sup> and NMVOC at 1070818.24\u202ft\u202fyr<sup>-1</sup>), increasing tropopause height (-0.10\u202fhPa\u202fyr<sup>-1</sup>), and the enhanced ozone flux at the tropopause (0.22 ppbv m s<sup>-2</sup>\u202fyr<sup>-1</sup>). Cluster analysis reveals different trends in TCO changes across regions. The ocean south of 60\u00b0S and parts of West Antarctica (Region 2), the region from 30\u00b0N to 60\u00b0N and the western oceanic region of 30\u00b0S (Region 3), and the region from the equator to 60\u00b0S and the region north of 60\u00b0N (Region 5) exhibit increasing trends (with rates of 0.08 DU yr<sup>-1</sup>, 0.07 DU yr<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.11 DU yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively), linked to the enhanced ozone flux at the tropopause, the rising tropopause height and increasing ozone p precursors. Conversely, the decreasing TCO trends in the equatorial Pacific (Region 1) and East Antarctica (Region 4) (with rates of -0.01 DU yr<sup>-1</sup> and -0.02 DU yr<sup>-1</sup>) may be related to increased cloudiness and weakened photochemical reactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
