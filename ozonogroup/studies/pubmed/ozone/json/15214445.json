In batch ozonation experiment of this study, the major ozonation by-products were bromate, bromform, aldehydes, and AOC, and the levels of these by-products is affected by operational parameters of ozonation. Results from rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) indicated that the granular activated carbon (GAC) capacity for BrO3- removal was dependent on the GAC type and empty bed contact time (EBCT). The GAC with a high number of basic groups and higher pH(pzc) values showed an increased BrO3- removal capacity. On the other hand, BrO3- removal was improved by increasing EBCT. In the GAC pilot plant, a GAC column (operating with 15 min EBCT) preloads for 12 months achieved a BrO3-, and AOC removal range from 7-96% and 41-85%, respectively. And the BrO3- amount removed was found to be proportional to the influent BrO3- concentration. However, the capacity of GAC for bromate adsorption apparently decreased with prolonged operational time (after 3 months). This may be a result of the bacterial biomass adsorbed on the GAC surface hindering BrO3- reduction by GAC either by blocking pores or adsorbing at the activated sites for BrO3- reduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Hung Kuang University, 34 Chung Chie Road, Sha-Lu, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15214445", "10.1080/09593332508618461"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
