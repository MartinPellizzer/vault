The trees (>55 and 125 years, 2.5 m high), representing six clones of Norway spruce, were fumigated in open-top chambers at two locations in Norway for one growth season. The needles were extracted with hexane and dichloromethane; 142 compounds from the hexane extract and 164 silylated compounds from the dichloromethane extract were analysed by gas chromatography although no identifications were made. The concentration of four of the compounds from the hexane extract changed with ozone dose in a way that made them promising as indicators, but the present analytical method could not verify this possibility. None of the other 302 compounds qualified as a general indicator of ozone stress in Norway spruce, as none changed its concentration with ozone dose consistently in all romets of all clones. Most of the variation in the experiment is mainly attributable to genetic variation and to climate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Norwegian Forest Research Institute, H\u00f8gskoleveien 12, N-1432 As, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogner", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091770", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90123-6", "0269749193901236"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
