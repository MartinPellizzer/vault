We examined air pollutant trends (PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>) in Slovenia, where in the past the main issue were SO<sub>2</sub> levels. Now, the population is still exposed to PM<sub>10</sub> and ozone levels that are above the recommended levels. Our goal was to assess if the levels of air pollutants were decreasing from 2002 to 2017 due to emission ceilings or were more influenced by changes in the meteorological situation. We modelled the relationship between levels, meteorological parameters, and seasonality and then used the models with the best estimated generalisation to adjust levels for meteorology. Models showed a significant relationship between meteorological parameters and PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> levels, but not SO<sub>2</sub>. We analysed trends of raw and adjusted levels and compared them. Trends of PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> were decreasing at all locations for raw and adjusted data. The largest decrease was observed in SO<sub>2</sub> levels where the largest decrease in emissions occurred. Trends of NO<sub>2</sub> were also significant and negative at most locations. Levels of O<sub>3</sub> did not exhibit a significant trend at most locations. Results show that changes in the meteorological situation affected PM<sub>10</sub> levels the most, especially where the entire period (2002-2017) could be observed. There is strong empirical evidence that changes in meteorological parameters contributed to the decrease in PM<sub>10</sub> levels while the decrease in NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> levels can be attributed to emission ceilings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
