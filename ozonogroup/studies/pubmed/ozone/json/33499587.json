For FAC, the degradation rates of extracellular <i>mecA</i> (extra-<i>mecA</i>) were accelerated with increasing FAC exposure, which could be explained by a two-step FAC reaction model. The degradation of extra-<i>mecA</i> by O<sub>3</sub> followed second-order reaction kinetics. The degradation of extra-<i>mecA</i> by UV exhibited tailing kinetics, which could be described by a newly proposed kinetic model considering cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation, its photoreversal, and irreversible (6-4) photoproduct formation. Measured rate constants for extra-<i>mecA</i> increased linearly with amplicon length for FAC and O<sub>3</sub>, or with number of intrastrand pyrimidine doublets for UV, which enabled prediction of degradation rate constants of extra-<i>mecA</i> amplicons based on sequence length and/or composition. In comparison to those of extra-<i>mecA</i>, the observed degradation rates of intracellular <i>mecA</i> (intra-<i>mecA</i>) were faster for FAC and O<sub>3</sub> at low oxidant exposures but significantly slower at high exposures for FAC and UV. Differences in observed extra- and intracellular kinetics could be due to decreased DNA recovery efficiency and/or the presence of MRSA aggregates protected from disinfectants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2177-1181"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, 61005, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yegyun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0550-0974"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington (UW), Seattle, Washington 98195-2700, United States."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7544-1642"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington (UW), Seattle, Washington 98195-2700, United States."}], "LastName": "Dodd", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5923-4897"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, 61005, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yunho", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33499587", "10.1021/acs.est.0c05274"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
