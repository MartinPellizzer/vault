Therefore, we sought to examine the associations between PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> and CMD using data collected from the Korean Community Health Survey.", "We selected 100,867 adults aged 19 years or older who had lived in the same domicile for \u226510 years and surveyed them to collect data on socioeconomic characteristics; health-related behaviors; obesity; and physician-diagnosed CMD history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and ischemic heart disease. We calculated interquartile ranges for PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> from the 10 year average concentrations (2003-2012). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were positively associated with PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> after adjusting for confounding factors. Obesity was positively associated with PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>. On the other hand, we found no associations between stroke, myocardial infarction, and ischemic heart disease and exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> in these subjects. In subjects aged \u226565 years, the risk of dyslipidemia was markedly increased under exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and CO compared to subjects aged <65 years. The risk of obesity was also significantly increased under exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. However, sex differences in these associations were not found.", "Long-term exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> may be a risk factor of CMD in Korean adults."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.
